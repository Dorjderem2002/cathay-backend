In 2016, she founded Planet Abled, a travel company that caters to the needs of people with various disabilities, a group the World Health Organization estimates at 15 percent of the world\u2019s population. Arora isn\u2019t the only one pushing for more thoughtful travel experiences\u2014here\u2019s a look at six companies focused on accessible travel.\nTravel for All\nTravel for All has organized more than 5,000 vacations around the world for travelers with a variety of requirements, including cane users, slow walkers, hearing and vision impaired persons, travelers with complex health issues like dialysis and developmental disabilities, and wheelchair users. \u201cAs multiple sclerosis began to affect my own personal travel, I researched what resources could assist me with executing travel using my wheelchair,\u201d says CEO Tarita Davenock. \u201cI was shocked when I saw the lack of services.\u201d Every trip Travel for All plans comes with an accessibility specialist. \u201cWe research and give our clients the pros and cons of any area in the world before planning the trip, so our client knows what to expect while they are in that destination,\u201d says Davenock. \u201cMeticulous planning and great attention to detail are the keystones of keeping our vacations safe.\u201d\nA Seable group trip in Cambodia, where travelers visited the Wat Phnom temple Courtesy Seable Holidays\nSeable Holidays\nSeable Holidays specializes in trips for visually impaired travelers. All trips include trained chaperones\u2014who undergo a background check\u2014as well as inclusive sports and sensory activities like horse riding, scuba diving, kayaking, wine tasting, yoga, and tactile museum excursions. And everything is thoroughly vetted, with chaperones, activities, and accommodations tested by blind people before they\u2019re recommended by the company. While trips are on pause during the pandemic, Seable Holidays will bring them back in summer 2022.\nEasy Access Travel\nDebra Kerper and her team at Easy Access Travel accommodate most types of physical disabilities in their solo trips and mixed group tours. While Kerper sometimes relies on her own experiences as a traveler in a wheelchair, she says every trip needs to be tailored to an individual client\u2019s needs. To do so, the team spends time getting to know their clients to match them with the best vacation choice, and visits hotels and tourist spots for inspection, takes cruises beforehand, and collects information from trustworthy sources to ensure a safe, accessible, and fun experience.\nPlanet Abled\nNeha Arora\u2019s Planet Abled arranges customized tours for people with different types of disabilities, and also plans group tours that include non-disabled people. Their trips mostly take place in India and South East Asia, with plans to expand to countries in Europe, and popular activities include river rafting, skiing, trekking, and wildlife safaris. Some of their extra touches include assigning a travel buddy for the blind, seeking special permission from museums so clients can touch and feel the articles on display, and arranging for sign language interpreters for the hearing impaired.\nWheel the World\nAlvaro Silberstein, the CEO of Wheel the World, was paralyzed from the chest down after surviving an accident at 18. This didn\u2019t stop him from seeing the world\u2014he\u2019s since visited 30 countries on five continents. \u201cI realized that people with disabilities should be able to explore places as anyone else,\u201d he says. Most of his clients are adults or seniors with mobility disabilities and wheelchair users, and he can arrange solo travel or group trips. Silberstein wants to create more awareness around accessibility, and his company pays special attention to details like the height of beds, width of doors, and accessibility of bathrooms, compiling this information on the Wheel the World website. Their multi-day trips are designed with local tour operators with a focus on accessible travel, and includes access to adaptive bikes, beach wheelchairs, and equipment for hiking, skydiving, kayaking, scuba diving, and surfing\u2014they\u2019ve even planned Macchu Pichu trips for wheelchair users. The company makes sure \u201cprices are competitive and the pricing is the same no matter if the clients have a disability or not,\u201d says Silberstein.\nA quiet moment in Sintra, Portugal Courtesy Tapooz Travel/Aicha Nystrom\nTapooz Travel\nLaurent Roffe and Aicha Nystrom spent years volunteering with an organization that provides outdoors excursions to people with disabilities. \u201cWe have many friends in wheelchairs as part of our close community,\u201d says Roffe. \u201cI\u2019m a sea kayak guide and [Aicha] is a ski guide and this has always been a source of immense joy for us. Launching our accessible travel business was a natural extension of what we are and what we like to do.\u201d Their company, Tapooz Travel, specializes in trips for those with mobility issues, including visual and hearing impairment, rather than cognitive disabilities. When they have a client with a visual or hearing impairment, they make sure there\u2019s at least one guide trained in sign language, or have a guide who can help with things like reading the menu at the restaurant and providing a voice narration during a site visit. Their network also includes adaptive sports instructors, sailboat skippers, tribal elders, massage therapists, and hot air balloon operators, all of whom are trained to work with travelers with disabilities."}, {"title": "The world\u2019s most wheelchair-accessible travel destinations", "article": "At Lonely Planet, we believe that travel should be for all, and that accessible travel information is vital to making that possible. And with one billion people in the world living with a disability, the more resources there are for travelers with disabilities, the better.\nIn partnership with KAYAK.com, we\u2019ve rounded up the top wheelchair-accessible destinations around the world. Consider these spots for your future travel plans.\nHow KAYAK.com can help you find accessible accommodations\nKAYAK.com's search features can help travelers with disabilities find accommodations that meet their needs. To find accessible hotels, first search for hotels in your destination, and then check the \u201cIncreased accessibility\u201d box in the \u201cAmenities\u201d filters on the left-hand side of the page. This filter reveals properties that offer these features: wheelchair accessible, facilities for disabled guests, in-room accessibility, accessible rooms, facilities for disabled guests, and disabled access.\nPlaya del Carmen, Mexico\nOne hour from Canc\u00fan International Airport, Playa Del Carmen is a far cry from its more revelrous neighbor, yet still has accessible hotels and an accessible beach furnished with beach wheelchairs. There\u2019s even adaptive equipment to allow you to go snorkeling to enjoy the coral reef and green turtles. But the main reason for coming here is to visit the nearby and largely wheelchair-accessible Mayan archaeological sites, Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 and Tulum, a rare chance for the mobility-impaired to get up close to ancient ruins.\nSan Diego skyline from the harbor \u00a9 David Toussaint / Getty Images\nSan Diego, California, USA\nWith the Americans with Disabilities Act having just celebrated its 30th anniversary, much of the USA\u2019s infrastructure is accessible, but our pick is San Diego. Laid out along the classic grid system, generally flat and with a fully accessible trolley system, it also boasts a balmy year-round 64-80\u00b0F climate.\nThe historic Gaslamp Quarter is very wheelchair friendly, as is the massive Balboa Park (incorporating the slightly hilly San Diego Zoo), but it\u2019s the miles of beachfront promenade with beach wheelchairs available \u2013 including a motorized one with caterpillar tracks at Mission Beach! \u2013 that are the main attraction.\nBarcelona, Spain\nWith the national tourism authority and Catalonia in particular pushing accessible travel, it\u2019s no surprise that wheelchair users have been flocking to Barcelona. With 80% of the metro stations and 100% of buses wheelchair-accessible, as well as a relatively flat and cobblestone-free old city, getting around is a breeze.\nWhat\u2019s more, wheelchair users not only jump to the front of the queue for attractions such as the breathtaking Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, they often get in for free! You can explore the length of La Rambla and get around the famous Mercat de la Boqueria; even the beach has wheelchair access and people on hand to help.\nWelcome to Las Vegas \u00a9 Michael Phillips / Getty Images\nLas Vegas, Nevada, USA\nLas Vegas is undoubtedly one of the most accessible cities for people with disabilities in the US. Of course, the casinos and the venues hosting world-renowned musicians and shows are all wheelchair accessible, as are the vast majority of sites and attractions, many of which \u2013 like the Fountains of Bellagio and the Fremont Street Experience \u2013 are completely free.\nMore surprising, perhaps, the High Roller \u2013 the tallest observation wheel in the world, which takes 30 minutes to do a full revolution \u2013 is also wheelchair-accessible. And if you\u2019re after an adrenaline rush, wheelchair users can even enjoy the SlotZilla Zip Line and the Zoomline, which reach speeds of up to 35 miles an hour, or a hot-air balloon ride over the city.\nAdd to this a very wide choice in accessible accommodation, easy exploration along the wide sidewalks of the Strip, a fully accessible bus service that serves all parts of the city, and plenty of wheelchair-accessible taxis and you can begin to understand why Las Vegas has become something of a destination for wheelchair users.\nManchester, UK\nAlthough it was the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, much of central Manchester was rebuilt in the late 1990s, making smooth, wide, step-free pavements, as well as stepless entry into shops, restaurants and bars the norm \u2013 ideal for anyone with mobility requirements.\nNorthern England\u2019s cultural hub is well served by accessible public transport, leaving you free to pay homage at Old Trafford, learn about our industrial roots at the Museum of Science and Industry or shop with the goths at Affleck\u2019s. And if you\u2019ve had enough of the city, the Peak District National Park, with well-developed facilities for visitors with disabilities, is less than an hour away.\nA piazza in Taormina, Sicily \u00a9 Matt Munro / Lonely Planet\nSicily, Italy\nItaly might not spring to mind as a very accessible destination due to its narrow, often cobblestone streets. But there are a number of tour operators that cater to travelers with disabilities. Motor-impaired travelers can enjoy scuba diving, 4WD off-road driving, traditional Sicilian fishing and olive oil making \u2013 not to mention the gastronomic delights normally associated with Italy. Indeed, two Guinness world records have been set here: first paraplegic to dive to 59m and first blind woman to dive to 41m!\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania, USA\nAs one of the oldest cities in the US, you might not expect Philadelphia to be very accessible \u2013 but it is! While the Old Town may offer some challenges for wheelchair users, sidewalks are generally well maintained in the more touristed areas, with plenty of curb cuts and tactile markings.\nThis is particularly useful for wheelchair users considering most of the city\u2019s attractions are within a two-mile radius of the City Hall. The subway, opened in 1907, is only partially wheelchair-accessible, as is the overland rail network, but unfortunately the aging trolley system is not. However, the city\u2019s fleet of more than 1000 buses are all low-floor and wheelchair-accessible, as is the PHLASH tourist bus which runs a continuous loop downtown, stopping at many popular attractions, and costs only $5 for an all-day pass.\nNeedless to say, all of the city\u2019s most popular attractions \u2013 including Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell, Love Park and the Philadelphia Museum of Art \u2013 are fully wheelchair-accessible despite their antiquity. And when it comes to finding accommodations, there are plenty of wheelchair-friendly options right in the center of the action.\nSandridge Bridge in Melbourne, Australia \u00a9 Catherine Sutherland / Lonely Planet\nMelbourne, Australia\nWith its highly accessible public transport system and compact city center, Melbourne is one of the most accessible cities in the world. Visit the sporting capital of Australia armed with Lonely Planet\u2019s accessibility guide, Accessible Melbourne, a free e-book that includes the most up-to-date advice for travelers with special needs. Discover Melbourne\u2019s best wheelchair-friendly restaurants, enjoy spectacular scenery along the Great Ocean Road, and visit one of the world\u2019s best zoos as well as many of the parks that progressive Parks Victoria is opening up to visitors with access needs.\nLjubljana, Slovenia\nSlovenia\u2019s flat and largely pedestrianized capital, served by accessible electric vehicles, is well worth a visit. Most of its buses are accessible, but the city is so small, with plenty of ramps and curb cuts, you might rarely need them.\nThe city\u2019s main drawcard, the 16th-century Ljubljana Castle is reached via a funicular (free for people with disabilities and a companion) or train, both wheelchair-accessible. Many of Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik\u2019s famous bridges have recently been made accessible, and were joined in 2010 by the award-winning Butchers\u2019 Bridge, which allows wheelchair users access to boats.\nSingapore has established accessibility requirements into its city code \u00a9 Ninnat Fongsupa / 500px\nSingapore\nSingapore has to be the most accessible city in Asia and one of the most accessible cities in the world. Its universal code on barrier-free accessibility, in place for decades, plus increasing affluence have resulted in an infrastructure with stepless access to most buildings and no shortage of curb cuts.\nAlthough power wheelchair-friendly taxis aren\u2019t common, the accessibility of the mass rail transit (MRT) and buses makes them unnecessary. In Singapore, the question is not \u201cwhat is accessible?\u201d but rather \u201cwhat isn\u2019t?\u201d \u2013 from its street food hawker centers to its marvelous zoo.\nVienna, Austria\nLike many European cities, Vienna is steeped in history, being the center of the former Habsburg Empire and the musical heart of Europe. Unlike many of its counterparts, however, its cobblestones have been removed, as have many of the curbs.\nThe refurbished city is both flat and compact, with most central shops and cafes fully accessible. Getting around is relatively easy with elevators to the metro and plenty of low-floor trams. Most museums and places of interest are fully accessible, including the must-see Schloss Sch\u00f6nbrunn.\nYou might also like:\nTake a spin around the globe with an accessible travel expert\nWhat I have learned from travelling the world with a wheelchair"}, {"title": "Accessible Travel Solutions", "article": null}, {"title": "So, What Is Accessible Travel?", "article": "Accessible travel means travel with a disability, right? Well, yes and no\u2026\nThere\u2019s been a lot of talk about \u201caccessible travel\u201d lately \u2013 especially since the UNWTO designated World Tourism Day to Tourism for All in 2016. But what exactly is it, and why is it so important?\nThe easy answer is that a billion people (that\u2019s 15% of the world\u2019s population), lives with some sort of disability, and ensuring equal access to travel is simply the right thing to do. In fact, the first human rights treaty of the 21st century was the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and Article 30 specifically calls for States Parties to ensure that people with disabilities enjoy the benefits of tourism \u2013 which will be all too familiar to any reader of this article.\nBut accessibility is so much more than \u201cmerely\u201d a human rights issue. In fact, tourism professionals are increasingly realising that it offers an economic opportunity by tapping into a market that is neither niche nor small. It\u2019s a misconception that people with a disability don\u2019t travel. We do. Our travel aspirations are very similar to the general population and, although it\u2019s true that the unemployment rate for people with a disability is higher than that for the general population, many of us have jobs and disposable income. South African Tourism\u2019s powerful commercial, featuring a blind tourist, shows how a disabled traveller is actually no different from any other traveller.\nA number of studies, in particular one by VisitEngland, have shown that the value of the so-called Purple Pound is already large and, importantly, that it\u2019s growing as a proportion of the overall tourism spend. A recent study for Tourism Australia found that the accessible travel market is already larger than the much-vaunted Chinese inbound market and is growing more quickly! What these studies have also underlined is the \u201cmultiplier effect\u201d: people, especially those with a disability, don\u2019t travel alone. For example, I travel with my wife and three children, so if a venue isn\u2019t accessible for me as a wheelchair user, it loses the revenue from not one, but five people.\nFIND OUT MORE ABOUT WHAT INTREPID ARE DOING TO MAKE TRAVEL ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYONE HERE\nBut with an ageing population in developed countries, it\u2019s fast becoming a social and economic imperative to provide accessible infrastructure, when already one in five people in the US and Australia are living with disability. Rightly or wrongly, the market driver of this segment is actually not people who identify as disabled, but the 40% of people who retire with an acquired disability \u2013 a figure that rises to 56% at age 70 and 70% at age 80. Currently, this is the retiring Baby Boomer population \u2013 possibly the first generation in human history that won\u2019t be passing on its wealth to its offspring, but instead feels it has earned the right to enjoy a retirement that is lasting longer and longer and, in most cases, involves travel.\nForward-thinking destination management organisations \u2013 such as VisitEngland, Visit Flanders, the German National Tourist Board and Catalonia \u2013 have already invested significant resources into developing tourism experiences and information portals to enable people with access issues to plan their trips more easily. And their marketing strategies \u2013 and, importantly, choice of imagery \u2013 are specifically targeting an ageing demographic. To ensure their business remains sustainable, tourism service providers are also increasingly looking to offer accessible travel experiences to cater to this demographic.\nRELATED: MEET THE FAMILY TRAVELLING THE WORLD WITH THREE KIDS (AND A WHEELCHAIR)\nIn Australia, and much of the world, we use the term \u201caccessible travel\u201d. But by emphasising access (and with most people equating \u201cdisability\u201d with \u201cwheelchair users\u201d), the stress is immediately put on compliance \u2013 the costly business of installing ramps and accessible toilets \u2013 rather than the opportunity to differentiate and capitalise on a large and growing market. In fact, wheelchair users make up less than 10% of the disabled population. People with vision or hearing impairments outnumber wheelchair users, and people with invisible disabilities \u2013 including those living with long-term illness and severe allergies such as coeliac disease \u2013 represent up to 75% of the disabled population. Even when considering people with a mobility impairment, there are up to four times more people who don\u2019t use a wheelchair than do. Think of your parents or grandparents, who might not use a cane, but still need a hand rail when negotiating stairs and really appreciate the occasional bench for a rest when wandering around parks and gardens. So when we talk about this travel \u201csegment\u201d, it would be so much better if we used the term \u201cinclusive travel\u201d to put the emphasis on making sure experiences are able to be enjoyed by the widest possible number of people, instead of making them accessible to a relatively small number of wheelchair users.\nLooking at it this way means there are countless small changes that businesses of all sizes could make that would benefit a wide range of travellers with access needs: assistance dog toileting areas and water bowls; TVs with a captioning option; clear passageways with good colour contrast and signage; large-print black-and-white information materials (ask anyone over 55 about reading fancy menus in dimly lit restaurants\u2026); easy-to-read fonts such as Arial or Helvetica in signage or information materials; hearing loops; telephones that are compatible with hearing aids; vibrating pillow alarms; lowered counters or an occasional table in front of reception to welcome wheelchair-using guests or people of short stature; blocks to adjust the height of beds or tables; making sure cooking and cleaning practices cater for people with food allergies or chemical intolerances\u2026 the list goes on.\nRELATED: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND TRAVEL WITH A HEARING IMPAIRMENT\nAnd let\u2019s not forget the value of a website that\u2019s accessible for people with disabilities, particularly the vision-impaired (Intrepid Travel are working towards having their website accessible to more people \u2013 by aiming for AA Level of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines \u2013 by the end of 2020). Because here\u2019s the thing: the greater one\u2019s access needs, the greater the need for planning using detailed and accurate information. But, ironically, relevant and reliable information regarding accessibility is hard to come by; it\u2019s often either missing or hidden away under FAQs.\nWhat are Intrepid doing to accommodate travellers with disabilities?\nTara Kennaway, who heads up Accessible Travel in Intrepid\u2019s Product team, had this to say. \u201cWe know that travellers with disabilities are increasingly looking beyond specialised disability tour operators and want to travel in an authentic, exploratory way with their family, friends and other like-minded people. We still have plenty of work to do to make our trips more accessible and to be able to share our style of exploring the world with as many people as possible. It\u2019s been fantastic to see the engagement of our staff around the globe in this topic, from our sales teams responding to enquiries from travellers with disabilities, our local operators auditing our trips in country, and our group leaders delivering amazing experiences and customer service to our travellers.\u201d\nIn order to travel independently, trustworthy information is the key and that\u2019s Lonely Planet\u2019s reason for being: to help travellers to get the best out of their trip by providing the information they need to make informed decisions. We have made a modest start by producing access guides to different destinations. Our Accessible Rio de Janeiro guide was supplied to the International Paralympic Committee for visiting athletes; the IPC have already signed up for an Accessible Tokyo guide for the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics. We have exciting plans for this guide as we look to partner with new technology partner What3Words, an innovative navigational mobile app, to get people with a disability exactly where they need to be.\nSUBSCRIBE TO INTREPID\u2019S NEWSLETTER FOR TRAVEL TIPS, COMPETITIONS, GIVEAWAYS & MORE\nI have also curated the world\u2019s largest collection of online resources for travelling with access needs: Accessible Travel Online Resources, which was recognised by the UNWTO in 2016 as one of a handful of examples of best practice in accessible tourism and is now vastly expanded in the current third edition. Lonely Planet\u2019s Accessible Travel Phrasebook contains some 100 words and phrases to assist disabled travellers to make their needs known in 35 languages.\nLonely Planet also publish online articles by disabled travel bloggers (including yours truly) and regularly share and promote the cause to our huge social media following, leveraging our authority in a positive way, in the hope that this will create a knock-on effect. Judging by a recent survey of followers, in which 43% told us they want it to hear more about accessible travel, it looks as though we\u2019re on the right track.\nIntrepid is committed to making travel widely accessible, regardless of ability or disability. If joining a group trip is not practical we may be able to provide you with a private departure.

These recommendations aim to guide the decision-makers of natural resources in tourism in undertaking accessibility improvements. The document has a particular focus on facilitating access to protected areas, beaches and parks. The WCPA Tourism and Protected Areas Specialist Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT), acted as the expert reviewers. Their involvement was key in identifying the best actions geared towards a greater extent of accessibility and inclusiveness within nature areas, vis a vis tourism. The guidance tool, whose drafting was led by UNWTO, the ONCE Foundation and UNE, is part of the promotion of ISO Standard 21902:2021. Download here the guidelines in English and Spanish.\nRecommendations for cultural tourism key players on accessibility UNWTO, Fundaci\u00f3n ONCE and UNE issued in September 2023, a set of guidelines targeting key players of the cultural tourism ecosystem, who wish to make their offerings more accessible.\nThe key partners in the drafting and expert review process were the ICOMOS International Cultural Tourism Committee and the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT). The ICOMOS experts\u2019 input was key in covering crucial action areas where accessibility needs to be put in the spotlight, in order to make cultural experiences more inclusive for all people.\nThis guidance tool is also framed within the promotion of the ISO Standard ISO 21902, in whose development UNWTO had one of the leading roles.

This is a key tool to understand specific actions that can be undertaken by a wide range of organizations entrusted with designing policies, strategies and destination marketing plans in the sphere of accessible tourism.

The ATD is an annual UNWTO distinction based on an Expert Committee evaluation, which acknowledges destinations enabling a seamless experience to any tourist, regardless of their abilities. The first ATD was awarded in 2019 and has been temporarily put on hold, given the pandemic.\nVideo \"Change your destination\" The video \u201cChange your destination\u201d was issued by Fundaci\u00f3n ONCE and UNWTO by the occasion of the 2019 International Fair of Tourism (FITUR). Facilitating travel for people with disabilities is an exceptional business opportunity. Yet, a change in mind-set and in the model of tourism services provision is needed in order to meet this major market demand. Accessible environments and services contribute to improve the quality of the tourism product and can create more job opportunities for people with disabilities. Accessibility, therefore, must be an intrinsic part of any responsible and sustainable tourism policy and strategy.\nWorld Tourism Day 2016: \"Tourism for All - promoting universal accessibility\" To mark the celebration of the World Tourism Day 2016 under the theme \"Tourism for All - promoting universal accessibility\" UNWTO, the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT) and the Spanish ONCE Foundation for the Social Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities have produced a compilation of Good Practices in the Accessible Tourism Supply Chain. While these examples provide a small sample of possible solutions regarding accessibility, they will hopefully inspire others to take steps towards broadening the availability of accessible offers in tourism destinations around the world. The publication has been laid-out following the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 (level AA) Download full text: Tourism for All - promoting universal accessibility UNWTO Recommendations on Accessible Information in Tourism The tourism sector stakeholders must deliver accurate, relevant and timely information to its customers, prior to, during and even after the journey. Ensuring that the information is accessible, is without any doubt a key to communicating successfully with visitors in all stages of their journey, particularly with regards to travelers with disabilities and special needs. The UNWTO Recommendations on Accessible Information in Tourism have been developed with the support and collaboration of the ONCE Foundation for Cooperation and Social Inclusion of People with Disabilities and the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT). They were adopted by the Resolution A/RES/669(XXI) of the General Assembly of UNWTO as a follow-up to the \u2018Recommendations on Accessible Tourism for All\u2019 of 2013.

Continued...\nWhat is Accessible Tourism?\nAccessible Tourism, as defined by Darcy and Dickson (2009, p34);\nAccessible tourism is the ongoing endeavor to ensure tourist destinations, products, and services are accessible to all people, regardless of their physical limitations, disabilities, or age.\nAccessible tourism encompasses publicly and privately owned tourist locations.\nAccessible tourism enables people with access requirements, including mobility, vision, hearing and cognitive dimensions of access, to function independently and with equity and dignity through the delivery of universally designed tourism products, services, and environments.\nThis definition is inclusive of all people, including those traveling with children in prams, people with disabilities and seniors.\nNoting the obstacles that persons with disabilities, or those with other access requirements, face in taking advantage of fundamental aspects of travel, senior United Nations (UN) officials urge policy-makers, travel planners and companies that work with persons with disabilities to work together to make travel more accessible.\nSpecific problems often encountered by the disabled tourist when trying to book a holiday, scenic tours, and accommodation can include:\nLack of well-adapted hotel rooms\nLack of accessible airport transfer\nLack of wheelchair accessible vehicles\nLack of accessible restaurants, bars, etc.\nInaccessible, or only partly accessible, websites\nLack of adapted toilets in restaurants and public places\nInaccessible streets (cars parking on the sidewalk, etc.)\nLack of professional staff capable of informing and advising about accessibility issues\nLack of disability equipment (wheelchairs, bath chairs, toilet raisers, electric scooters)\nLack of reliable information about a specific attraction's level of accessibility (church, castle, exhibition, etc.)\nDisability Travel Tips\nBicycle shops are great places for wheelchair replacement parts.\nLearn foreign vocabulary that can help you describe your situation and needs.\nConsider getting travel insurance. Make sure that it covers pre-existing conditions.\nBring plenty, even extra, of any medications that you take. Make sure that all medicines are allowed in the country you're visiting.\nLook for disability organizations or resources at your destination that can provide you with area-specific information as well as local contacts.\nIf you use an electric wheelchair, look into whether you'll need a plug adapter and a voltage converter. Or see whether you can rent a battery charger abroad. Have a contingency plan if power outages or voltage drops.\nHave a backup plan, including your accommodation. In case your reserved accessible room isn't available, bring along items such as a portable ramp, a shower chair and a reacher to grab items that may be beyond arm's length.\nKnow your rights. This is particularly important for airline travel, at the airport and on the plane. Familiarize yourself with applicable laws and airline regulations. Inform the airline of your situation and make assistance requests in advance.\nUnderstand cultural differences. You may get more, or less, attention in other countries than you would in the United States. Then again, Roth-Vinson says, you may stand out more as an American than as a wheelchair user or a blind person.\nMajor Airline Travel Tips for Travelers with Disabilities - Jessica Padykula - (2015-02-12)\nTips to Make Traveling with a Disability Easier - Helen Hecker - (2008-12-24)\nWheelchair Travel Tips - J.D. - (2010-07-01)\nSubtopics and Associated Subjects\nadvertisement"}, {"title": "Inclusive Holidays: Diverse and Joyful Travel Experiences", "article": "From the bustling streets of Melbourne to the serene tropical paradises of Bora Bora, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re spinning through the globe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hottest spots and bringing you along for the exhilarating ride!"}, {"title": "Unique, All-Inclusive Experiences Around the World to Try", "article": "Luxury meets convenience in the latest travel trend sweeping the globe: all-inclusive hotels and resorts.

Around the world, despite having the time and money to travel, millions of people with disabilities or reduced mobility are unable to do so due to a lack of facilities. What is more, because of the demographic change in many countries and the growing desire of the elderly to travel, potential demand in this market will rise significantly. These are the findings of the latest ITB World Travel Trends Report, compiled by IPK International and commissioned by ITB Berlin.\nAccording to Lilian M\u00fcller, President of the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT), the most recent statistics reveal that in Europe alone there are 80 million people with disabilities: \u201dGlobal estimates range from 600 million to 900 million.\u201c That means that with world\u2019s population now at seven billion, about ten per cent require barrier-free and easily accessible facilities.\nCommenting, Dr. Martin Buck, director of the Competence Center Travel & Logistics, Messe Berlin, said: \u201cIt is important for the global travel industry to exploit this potential, as removing barriers enables not only the disabled to enjoy stress-free holidays. Other groups, for example families with young children, accident victims and the elderly, also benefit from barrier-free arrangements.\u201c\nLack of arrangements hampers market growth\nThe economic importance of this market is huge: US adults with disabilities or reduced mobility spend around 13.6 billion dollars on travel every year. In Germany, turnover in this market is estimated at around 2.5 billion euros and in the UK at almost two billion pounds. \u201cIn the future these figures may well rise\u201c, said Lilian M\u00fcller. In recent years, around 37 per cent of disabled people in Germany have decided not to travel due to a lack of easily accessible facilities. However, 48 per cent would travel more if the necessary arrangements existed. 60 per cent would even be willing to pay higher travel costs for better accessibility.\nAccording to Lilian M\u00fcller, barrier-free tourism should no longer be a niche market: \u201cAccessibility arrangements must be part of every single travel package. There is also a demand for specialist operators to offer services for customers with greater mobility needs\u201c, she added. The internet represents an important platform for achieving a barrier-free future. That means tour operators and travel agencies making their internet information accessible to blind and deaf persons. According to a survey by ENAT, in 2011 only 10 out of 39 websites could be accessed by the disabled.\nThe ITB World Travel Trends Report has more information on barrier-free tourism as well as details of every survey on global tourism trends. It can be downloaded at www.itb-berlin.com. The report is based on the assessments of 50 tourism experts from 30 countries, on a special IPK International trend analysis undertaken in leading source markets, and on core data supplied by the World Travel Monitor\u00ae, recognised as the largest continuous survey of global travel trends in some 60 source countries. The findings reflect trends which emerged during the first eight months of 2012. At the ITB Berlin Convention Rolf Freitag, CEO of IPK International, will present the findings for the entire year, as well as the latest forecasts for 2013.\nFrom 10.30 to 11.45 on Friday, 8 March 2013 at the ITB Berlin Convention, a keynote panel will examine \u201cBarrier-free tourism for everyone: quality and success criteria for ensuring the marketability of destinations.\u201d"}, {"title": "Tourism for All, barrier-free tourism in Germany", "article": "The project \"Introduction of the labeling & certification system \"Travel for All\" was developed over several years of cooperation and coordination with tourism stakeholders.

Barrier-free tourism is one of the few segments with growth and great economic potential in Germany. Accessibility is essential for about 10% of the population, 40% helpful and 100% comfortable.

Certain sustainable development is ambiguous ground but in the tourism activities it is very pressing for the negative impacts of the classical tourism model.\nThese assumptions are useful to analyze the costs and benefits of inclusive tourism, thanks to the pyramid of accessibility. This study will in fact make it possible to determine, on the basis of the resources present in the territory, the opportunities and limits of this type of tourism.\nIn European destinations, above all, in Italy, the openness to inclusive tourism can constitute a new cycle of tourism product such as to activate that interest and curiosity that drives tourists to visit the destination. This chapter describes at first the criteria for the planning of tourism for all, and finally, in the second part, it will deal with the international policies for the realization of tourism for all.\nThe traditional model of tourist destination is characterized by tourist attractions and related infrastructure, often avoiding the local people. The resort or tourist villages are born to entertain tourists, but they did not involve local people. Nowadays the tourism and the resorts are changing, and so a lot of destinations are involving a new idea of tourism with the accomplishment of the local people that can support the persons with specials needs to live an independent travel as inhabitans.\nIt is therefore necessary to look for new models in tourism that can create a dialogue, peace and fruitful encounter between guests and the local community. This involvement, in fact, can be activated directly or indirectly \u2013 with or without the presence of the local community in all activities of tours \u2013 but always in accordance with the need of each other. Tourism for all is a new idea but is the future of tourism for different reasons: the first is that the needs of people, especially those with differences or disabilities, are increased in all parts of the world and they required the solution immediately and tailor-made; the second consists in the hypothesis that if guests can have more economic and especially technological potential, they can support and transfer their know-how to all those who suffer from that particular disorder, providing this benefit; and the third gives sustainability using the appropriate resources to enhance tourist activities.\nIn this new vision, the World Tourism Organization has attributed to tourism for all a broader vision than accessible tourism alone, combining sustainable and social tourism in a single form of tourism, including every person regardless of gender or other forms of diversity.\nIn the innovative strategy of inclusive tourism, it should be pointed out that destinations will have to develop plans and appropriate policies for sustainability and accessibility. This form of tourism, which certainly has social aims, could also be conflicting if, for example, accessibility makes use of very invasive technologies or not too much in line with the efficiency and protection of the environment. Tourism for all, therefore, becomes an ambitious project to be implemented at the local level to create a model, so valid to the global level."}, {"title": "Improving the Accessibility of the Tourism Industry in New Zealand", "article": "The purpose of this paper is to report on the tourism experiences of people living in New Zealand with an access requirement. The aim was to understand the expectations and experiences of the access consumer to suggest improvements for accessibility of the New Zealand tourism sector. Many people in the industry consider the access tourists\u2019 needs as expensive to accommodate or only focus on the physical barriers that need to be removed [ 9 10 ]. For many access travelers, having tourist organizations and destinations meet their basic essential requirements can be a struggle [ 10 12 ]. In this paper, we identify the service expectations of access tourists and how the industry could alter their offerings to create inclusive tourism offerings that meet and perhaps even exceed these expectations. The paper will first provide some key background information regarding disability, impairment, inclusion, and accessibility. Following this section, relevant literature will discuss examples of best practice. The final sections of the paper draw on our New Zealand data to provide qualitative examples of access tourists\u2019 expectations and experiences.\nThe term \u2018accessible\u2019 relates to broader and inclusive concepts than the words disability or impairments [ 9 ]. Accessibility includes seniors, visual needs, intellectual disabilities, parents with pushchairs and temporary impairments. In addition, there is a 59% chance that anyone over the age of 65 years will face some kind of impairment that limits their everyday activities [ 6 ]. The term disability has been critiqued, as it is regularly over-used and can have negative connotations that tend to homogenize and generalize people with access needs [ 9 ]. The term disability enhances two problems and myths. Firstly, the label can be restrictive, as the general public tend to think that the term only applies to a person in a wheelchair and then consider physical barriers as the main problem. Many disabilities and access needs are broader and are not always visible such as intellectual, pain, hearing, and vision impairments. Secondly, the label can be viewed as offensive, as it places the responsibility or deficit on the individual rather than considering the way in which wider society structures policies, physical spaces, language, communications, and institutions. The disability label emphases the condition and places responsibility on the person before considering wider inferences [ 3 9 ].\nDespite these economic and social change opportunities, the basic tourism service expectations of people with access requirements are not being met, or even aligning with the 2030 UNWTO tourism sustainability goals for the tourism industry [ 7 ]. There remains no access agenda within the New Zealand tourism strategy despite the potential of the access tourism market. Internationally, tourism researchers have also noted that the industry tends to be reluctant to communicate with the access market, as they often perceive the access tourist as difficult and expensive to accommodate [ 8 ]. It is also clear that the myths perpetuated within the industry about access tourists as not interested in travelling or having the financial means to engage in tourism or being difficult to accommodate are all unwarranted. An agenda to make New Zealand tourism more accessible is thus warranted.\nTourism is usually viewed as a pleasurable activity. Yet, for people with access needs, it can be a site of inequalities and frustration. Internationally, the accessible tourism market has been identified as a growing segment that could lead the way for social inclusiveness, as well as providing the industry with financial gains and destination competitiveness [ 1 2 ]. The term accessible tourism relates to activities that people can freely select to join and are able to enjoy regardless of any disability, health issue, impairment, functioning abilities, or physiological imperatives [ 3 ]. Previous scholars from tourism [ 3 4 ] and economic studies [ 5 ] have concluded that the accessible tourism market is a significant and profitable area but is consistently ignored by the tourism industry. It has been estimated that more than 500 million people around the world identify themselves as having a disability or an access requirement [ 5 ]. In Europe, for instance, a Spanish study illustrated that access tourists spend more, they tend to travel with companions (resulting in a double spend) and have the possibility of generating at least 2.4 billion for the Spanish tourist industry [ 5 ]. Examples from New Zealand also illustrate the potential of this segment. For example, Statistics New Zealand in 2013 found that 24% of people identified with a disability, and this was a significant increase from previous years and represents the possible domestic tourism market available [ 6 ].\nAccess tourism in New Zealand, the context of this study, is practically ignored and not acknowledged [ 10 18 ]. It is obvious that New Zealand has not realized the potential in having accessible environment, information, products, and services to better cater for people with access needs. Yet, research has shown that once the tourism sector is educated properly to understand the challenges and barriers they begin to understand and potentially influence a change of attitude and behavior [ 40 ]. As such, tourism industry operators and employees need to be equipped with the relevant information and skills necessary to recognize people with disabilities as a very important market segment, and there are opportunities to make progress towards making tourism more accessible. However, making tourism accessible requires greater consideration of the challenges and barriers to be eliminated through the offering of tourism products and services that cater to the needs of people with access requirements and enabling expected and enjoyable experiences.\nIt is therefore argued that effective tourism providers need to be educated and trained to recognize the different needs of those who have access requirements [ 38 ]. They should be able to identify the barriers that restrict those individuals and be able to utilize that knowledge to develop strategies to allow people with access needs to participate. If tourism providers want to definitely understand the needs of people with access needs, they need to first determine how those individuals in that group identify themselves, what their travel preferences are, and what form of communication channel is best [ 19 ]. When tourism providers are able to cater to people with access needs, they will potentially obtain long-term customers who are loyal to the businesses that were able to best serve their needs [ 39 ].\nIn addition to transport providers, travel agents too pose barriers to tourism for people with disabilities. Specifically, the lack of training for tourism employees explains why travel agents are criticized, because they are seen as gatekeepers of travel information [ 8 ]. They lack knowledge in access needs for tourists and become an obstacle providing accurate information. There are three reasons to why travel agents are criticized: they lack the understanding of market needs from people with disabilities, information provision, and their willingness to cater for the sector [ 17 ]. When travel agents are recommending destinations of travel, they do not consider accessibility and whether it would be easy to get around and have suitable facilities that meet their needs. This is primarily because they are not aware of the difficulties that people with access needs have when travelling. There have been instances where travel agents have indicated to access needs people that certain destinations are accessible, but upon arriving to the destination, the client realized that the agent had a different understanding of \u201caccessible\u201d [ 21 ].\nGiven the above, for transport to be fully accessible, transportation agencies need to understand the nature of travel demand and the reasons for travel and specific needs [ 37 38 ]. For instance, transportation organizations need to consider implementing education and training around how to interact with people with access needs. Most importantly, they need to understand that flexibility is key for people with access requirements, because they are heavily reliant on public transport. Therefore, transportation agencies need to include people with access requirements involved with the decision making process and planning to ensure their requirements are being meet whist travelling [ 36 ]. Improved mobility for people with access requirements enhances the quality of life through extending accessibility to both facilities and opportunities, and alleviates social exclusion [ 32 ].\nIn the tourism value chain, effective and efficient transport systems are crucial for people with access requirements but are seen as one of the most difficult barriers they encounter in travel and tourism [ 17 20 ], primarily because the services offered are either difficult to access, not reliable, or do not meet the needs of the individuals [ 32 33 ]. The lack of accessible public transport excludes those who have access requirements, as the current transportation methods are designed to cater for people with able bodies [ 32 34 ]. Research indicates that people with access needs only make one third of the number of trips per week as those without disabilities [ 32 ]. As such, people with access requirements decide between staying at home or waiting for family or friends to provide transport to achieve tasks or activities [ 35 ]. If transportation providers want to avoid this occurrence, they need to consider the entire trip \u201cfrom door to door\u201d for people with access requirements [ 35 ] (p. 3). Taxi companies are known for offering accessible vehicles for people with access needs. However, people with access requirements are reluctant to use their services, as they are unreliable and costly [ 36 ]. Transport that is offered to people with access needs is viewed as a \u201cspecial service\u201d and segregates those who use those particular services [ 37 ]. People with access requirements are dependent on those specialized services, because there are limited alternatives for them to reach their desired destination.\nThe most common restriction for people with access requirements is structural and architectural barriers that limit a person\u2019s accessibility [ 19 ]. The design of facilities is crucial for a person with access needs to ensure that they are able to achieve tasks without health and safety risks or difficulty while in the facilities. Sometimes businesses make certain areas accessible, but the route or the accessibility chain breaks when other crucial areas are inaccessible when needed to be used [ 30 31 ]. For example, when hotels design accessible rooms to be on the second floor, but do not think to install elevators to help with the ease of access to those rooms, it poses challenges for the traveler [ 17 ].\nThe concept of accessible tourism, or barrier-free tourism, focuses on providing independence, equality, and dignity for travelers with disabilities or those requiring access needs through the delivery of universally designed products, services, and environments [ 2 ]. The purpose of accessible tourism refers to tourism providers being able to cater to the needs of a range of consumers with access needs, including persons with disabilities [ 22 ]. The implementation of accessible tourism in businesses requires the removal of institutional and environmental barriers in society, and encompasses accessibility in the physical environment, in transportation, and other facilities and services [ 29 30 ]. Accessible tourism can only effectively operate when stakeholders within the organization, and within the wider tourism system, collaborate to enable people with access requirements to travel, ensuring that the whole journey to, from, and within the destination is accessible, along with their experiences [ 10 ]. A number of best practice models have been considered within the tourism literature [ 30 31 ].\nIncreasing the level of a person with disabilities\u2019 quality of life depends on the inclusiveness of society and the community in which they live. People with access requirements tend to be segregated and ignored within society [ 26 28 ] and face social stigma [ 9 26 ]. People with disabilities are not offered the same opportunities as those who are able bodied, and their voices are being disregarded from communities [ 27 32 ]. However, Darcy and Dickson [ 3 ] have argued it is time for society to change its attitude and behavior towards people with disabilities and welcome them into communities and provoke interaction and participation. People with access requirements, like able-bodied people, want to meet new friends, have opportunities for social interaction, and be included and participate in a recreation activity to enhance their lives [ 20 23 ].\nScholars argue that the tourism industry has not adequately considered the concept of accessibility, nor are they making changes to their current operations to better cater to those with disabilities [ 4 20 ]. It has been surmised that the tourism industry is generally unaware of the population of disabled people or the fact that their facilities or services are not accessible to everyone [ 18 ] and has ignored this valuable market [ 9 ]. As such, the tourism literature is replete with studies of the inaccessibility and barriers to participation in tourism for travelers with disabilities [ 19 21 ]. The barriers to participation are generally categorized as physical, informational, and attitudinal [ 22 ]. Yet, participation in tourism is found to contribute meaning and to an individual\u2019s quality of life [ 20 26 ].\nThe New Zealand Disability Strategy (2016\u20132026) aims to ensure a long-term approach for developing partnerships for transformative initiatives that create an inclusive society [ 16 ]. The strategy was developed through collaboration, participation, and feedback from a range of stakeholders, including people with access requirements, organizations within the disability sector, education, local government, health sectors, and private sector businesses. The 2016\u20132026 strategy has moved away from an orientation that focused on barriers to instead aiming for equity, improvements, opportunities, empowerment, and inclusion. The overarching vision is that \u201cNew Zealand is a non-disabling society\u2014a place where disabled people have equal opportunity to achieve their goals and aspirations, and all of New Zealand works together to make this happen\u201d [ 16 ] (p. 6). The strategy has eight target outcomes focusing on education; employment and economic security; health and well-being; rights protection and justice; accessibility; attitudes, choice, and control; and leadership. The New Zealand tourism sector certainly needs to be involved in contributing to these strategy outcomes and working to address how they meet the expectations of their access consumers.\nIn New Zealand, around one million people have a physical impairment, learning disability, age-related need, short term impairment, or access need [ 11 ]. This equates to about one in four of New Zealand\u2019s population identifying as disabled, which was a significant increase from the 21% in 2001 [ 11 ]. There is a 59% chance of people who are aged 65 or over are more likely to be disabled rather than adults under 65 years of 21% or children under 15 years 11% [ 6 ]. It is clear from these statistics that a significant and rapidly increasing proportion of New Zealand\u2019s population is now in the senior older age groups, with these age groups more likely to experience disability compared to younger adults or children.\nDisability is defined as the process that happens when one group of people create barriers and inequalities of access to another group by designing a world for their way of living, taking no account of the impairments other people may have in society [ 6 13 ]. In an equal and democratic society, people who live with an access requirement should have the same opportunities as those who are able bodied, as they too aspire to live and have a good life [ 14 ]. Society is built in a way that assumes we can all see signs, read directions, hear announcements, reach buttons, have the strength to open heavy doors, and have stable moods and perceptions [ 11 13 ]. It is with this knowledge that New Zealand has established a disability strategy to ensure an inclusive society. New Zealand aims for people who have access requirements to be able to say that they live in \u201ca society that highly values our lives and continually enhances our full participation\u201d [ 15 ] (p. 1).\nThematic analysis was used to analyze both sets of data and is the most common form of analysis in qualitative research [ 43 47 ]. One of the advantages of thematic analysis is that it is theoretically flexible, allows the researcher to focus on meanings across data sets, and focuses on what is common across participant experiences [ 43 47 ]. The interviews were recorded and transcribed manually. The completed online interview information was collected and included with the interview data analysis. The analysis procedures followed the inductive thematic analysis approach used by previous qualitative scholars [ 46 47 ]. The first step is to get a sense of the whole data through reading the transcripts text while considering our purpose in the study. This is the text and first literal coding stage of analysis. Charmaz [ 46 ] advises that as researchers analyze, they should be asking themselves \u201cwhat is going on? What are people doing? What do these actions/statements take for granted? How do structure and context serve to support, maintain, impede or change these actions and statements?\u201d. The next step is to identify patterns, themes, and convergence. This is the second step that focuses on the analytical aspects of analysis. In this second step, the researcher is trying to identify what is important for the participant, what is common, and importantly what is less apparent and or missing or not mentioned. The final step is the focused coding of themes and elucidate meanings with a synthesis of the relevant literature and theories. A key advantage of this three step process of thematic analysis is that it is theoretically flexible, allows re-reading, the researcher can focus on meanings across data sets, and it identifies what is common as well as invisible across participant experiences [ 43 47 ]. Ethical approval for the study was gained from the University of Waikato\u2019s ethics committee. If also asked, ethical discussions were held with various access organizations and communities. This was to build trust and ensure that we were informed by any ethical advice and requirements required by the access sector and communities.\nThe online interview asked the same basic demographic questions as the face-to-face interview, followed by the same open-ended questions as the semi-structured interviews. The aim of the interview conducted online was to allow people to participate who may not have been physically able or well enough to be involved in the face-to-face interviews. The online option offered a second communication channel for participants to share their experiences with us about domestic tourism and travel. Access to the online interview was communicated to potential participants by access coordinators and employment consultants from three community service organizations. In total, there were 16 online interviews, with ten fully completed interview documents returned to the researchers. Six of the online interviews were incomplete and discounted from our analysis. In total, the study had 21 participants who shared their experiences about tourism and travelling in New Zealand.\nA call for participants was placed in various social media channels and on community access organizations\u2019 noticeboards. Eleven people volunteered to be interviewed for the in person interview. To ensure anonymity for the participants, numbers are used to disguise interview participants\u2019 identities. All participants received ethical information as per our agreement with the University\u2019s ethical committee. The benefits of conducting in person interviews are that this tool is appropriate for the paradigm and provides flexibility for hearing richer in-depth information from participants. In person interviews are suitable, as they enabled opportunities for follow up or impromptu questions from both the researcher and participants, as well as allowing participants to clarify their comments and elaborate when required on their answers. This tool was essential for both able bodied researchers and also the tourism sector to adopt, as it allowed deeper understandings to emerge of accessible experiences and undermined many of the stereotypes prevalent in the sector about accessibility.\nPurposeful sampling criteria was adopted in this study, as illustrated in Table 1 , to select participants who were information- and experience-rich, aiming to develop in-depth insights into their tourism experiences [ 43 ]. The interview participants included any individual who had an impairment, disability, long-term health issue or physical access requirement and who had recently experienced domestic travel in the last six months. In total for this study, the interviews included twenty one people who had participated. The interview questions were first pilot tested with participants from an access organization to reduce any misunderstandings before being conducted with the twenty one participants.\nIn this study, qualitative semi-structured interviews, both in-person and online, were adopted to enable participants to voice their expectations and experiences of travel and tourism in New Zealand. These tools were adopted to ensure that we facilitated the inclusion of participants who may have not been able to attend a face-to-face interview. As Table 1 illustrates, all our participants had a physical impairment and none had any cognitive difficulties. The semi-structured interviews began with open \u201dice-breaker\u201d type questions asking the participant to share their background and defining and describing expectations regarding their ideal New Zealand travel and tourism experience. The purpose of this questioning was to get the participants focused on the topic and start thinking about their travel and tourism experiences. These were followed with more open-ended questions around planning, transport, accommodation, defining accessibility, and tourist experience/events. These questions asked participants to comment on their New Zealand experiences, what they thought worked well, and what they considered could be implemented to create more enjoyable experiences for the access tourist. The final question asked the participants to describe their ideal experience and what key points they would like to pass on to organizations who need help to move towards accessibility.\nCritical scholars who have adopted this framework also examine the concept of \u201cagency\u201d to investigate issues of power, assumptions, and structures that can facilitate or create exclusion [ 40 44 ]. Aligning with the social constructivism paradigm, the perspective employed in this study was the social model of disability [ 14 ]. In rejecting the traditional positivist medical model of disability, we are against positioning people living with a disability, impairment, or access issue as passive and invisible in society and our research. The social model of disability endeavors to identify the central causes of broader systems, polices, negative attitudes, discourses, and exclusionary actions in society that are contributing factors to disabling people [ 14 15 ]. The fundamental aspect of social model of disability is \u201cequality\u201d, social change that empowers and enables people to make decisions about their lives. The social model of disability tends to focus on changes for society that could be implemented around, for instance, attitudes and labeling, and aims to ensure that systems and environments are inclusive [ 13 42 ]. For this model then, disability arises because of language, discourses, systems, environment, and discriminatory policies that people with access requirements face.\nIn contrast, the social constructionism paradigm examines the language, discourses, institutions, organizations, and systems that shape a person\u2019s world-view to understand the subjective experiences of the participant [ 42 44 ]. For those working in this paradigm, there is no ultimate truth, foundations, or correct way of conceiving the world, rather it is an interpretation shaped by individual and broader influencers on the phenomena [ 42 44 ]. This paradigm rejects the medical model of disability that relies on positivism\u2019s generalizations and reductionism, instead it draws on its roots from phenomenology to examine \u201cself-evident, taken-for-granted truth[s]\u201d [ 42 ] (p. 24). Assumptions, everyday myths, and practices that are seen as common sense become the focus of researchers working within this paradigm.\nThis study adopted a social constructivism framework, as this paradigm aligns with the social model of disability that seeks to understand individuals within their broader social context [ 13 43 ]. In doing so, we reject positivistic research approaches for a number of reasons, but namely because they apply a deductive approach that does not privilege the participant\u2019s lived experiences [ 43 44 ]. Critiques from disability researchers have identified that this paradigm tends to be used by abled bodied researchers who do not understand both the dehumanizing historical context of this perspective nor grasp the lived experience of living in a society that disables, labels, and restricts the disabled body [ 42 44 ]. The positivist paradigm also neglects agency and uneven relationships of power between the research academic and participant, all of which replicates the lack of agency in the access person\u2019s everyday experiences [ 10 47 ].\nThe themes illustrating these commonalities were grouped as defining and gaining accessibility, information gathering and planning, transport, and education. All participants were passionate about the need for accessible tourism in New Zealand. Participants also lamented that despite having a New Zealand Disability Strategy, there were still no clear regulations around accessibility. In effect, the strategy is a suggestion for New Zealand tourist organizations, rather than a policy regulation. Although international travel and tourist sites had their challenges for all the participants, they stated that their home country of New Zealand was particularly poor in meeting their expectations in an equitable and inclusive manner. Domestic tourism restricted participants from leading independent and dignified lives in their own country. The following section will illustrate and discuss our participants\u2019 expectations and experiences of tourism.\nOur results illustrated that for all twenty one participants, accessibility is a diverse experience requiring different, creative, but inclusive understandings and solutions. Yet, in noting this diversity of experience, it was clear from our results, as identified by McKercher and Darcy [ 19 ], \u201cthat people only become \u2018disabled\u2019 when faced\u201d (p. 62) with structural, societal discourses; inadequate information; and interpersonal naiveties encountered from others in the industry [ 20 ]. Our results certainly illustrated these issues for the access tourist, and if addressed, then this would enhance and perhaps even exceed the expectations of this growing segment. Participants identified that developing inclusive understandings can also sometimes provide inexpensive solutions for change that could be easily implemented in the New Zealand domestic tourism sector. For many of our participants, there was a clear overwhelming desire for the sector to first become more informed about the access consumer.\nThis finding illustrates how society excludes and reinforces dependency. Planning their local travel and tourism become an essential, but for some of our participants, this was a dreaded process they had to endure. A solution offered by some of our participants was that they or an access advocacy organization could offer deeper understandings of the expectations of the access consumer to the sector if they were regularly included in participatory dialogues and opportunities for planning. Tippet and Fraser How [ 51 ], for instance, have argued that co-participatory dialogue tools and engagement practices can help to \u201cstructure effective thinking \u2026 how dialogue can reframe issues\u201d for planners to aid deeper insight into access issues (p. 128). Their work illustrates through various case studies how planners and business stakeholders have gained tacit understandings through collaborative dialogue and planning that \u201csurface[ed] \u2026 place-based knowledge \u2026 [for] building relationships of trust and mutual understanding [and] capacity building to support further action and learning\u201d (p. 128).\nGaining choice and control was seen as essential and desirable by all our participants in order to achieve dignity and independence. Interestingly, many participants felt that the local tourism destinations and sector was much more difficult and less likely to be inclusive compared to overseas travel and tourism organizations. Frustratingly, their desire for access and inclusion was rarely met with notable award-winning local examples, mentioned by several participants as not being accessible. This restricted their inclusion and reduced their participation with their local tourism activities. Participants said they needed to rely on others, ask for help in order to explore the tourism activity, and they felt that they \u201cbecome a burden\u201d. Another person commented that they \u201ccannot travel in New Zealand like I do overseas\u201d. Participants noted that there were certain \u201cno go zones\u201d (interview participant five) in their local areas. These areas, for instance, included locations that were physically difficult to navigate around, into, and through due to steepness, gravel, and small pathways or bridges. At the time of the study, participants that were visually or sensory impaired needed to plan their visit, as access to volunteers was limited and there were reduced accessible signposts to provide information or maps and no access to accessible devices such as earphones. Unfortunately, many accessible tourists found they could not enjoy their local tourism activities or venues and had to adapt themselves to the environment, which reduced their expectations and overall enjoyment of the activity.\nDespite individual differences depending on their personal situation, there were commonalities regarding defining what access means that were stated by all participants. For instance, interviewee 2 said \u201ctourism is for everybody, so it should be equal whether you are impaired or not and should be accessible\u201d, while online interview participant 9 wrote \u201cit\u2019s about equity of access\u201d. Other common words used from the data to define the term were \u201cequity\u201d, \u201copportunities\u201d, \u201ceverybody\u201d, \u201cnormal\u201d, \u201csame\u201d, \u201cindependence\u201d, and \u201cequality\u201d. All these words illustrate their desire for inclusion, participation, and being able to gain the same tourism enjoyment as others. As Darcy and Dickson [ 3 ] have argued, tourism should include planning for achieving independence, equity, and importantly dignity. Dignity, as Hobson [ 49 ] states, \u201cis essential for a life well lived \u2026 worth living\u201d (p. 22), and for Bolton [ 50 ], it entails \u201crespecting people as people \u2026 importance of human relationships \u2026 offer autonomy\u201d (p. 9). These terms from our participants encompass much of Hobson and Bolton\u2019s [ 49 50 ] sentiments around accessibility being worthy of being included, respect, and having a choice to be involved.\nAccessible tourism has been defined by scholars as activities in tourism that people can freely choose to participate in and enjoy regardless of any impairment, functioning abilities, or physiological imperatives [ 3 ]. In this study, participants were asked to define and describe their understandings of accessible tourism to gain an insight into their expectations and what their ideal tourism experience would involve. It was clear from their description of accessibility and what was required to gain access that at times the needs of each disability did differ. This was not an unexpected finding, as working within access communities, we were well aware that an accommodation for one type of access may create a barrier for another. For instance, lighting or floor coverings could assist those with a visual impairment, but cause problems for wheelchair users or those with seizure disorders [ 48 ]. A study focusing on the design of a building for access organizations in the USA found that in grassroots consultation with users, solutions were identified to these kind of issues, so that the building could be used by a wide variety of access users [ 48 ]. This heterogeneous aspect of disability did not pose issues for defining access or identifying solutions to gain accessibility, as the process of hearing and including diverse stakeholders was crucial to the success of the building process.\n6. Information Gathering and Planning\n38, Accurate, quality, and honest information is essential for accessible tourists. Prior planning for people with access needs becomes essential as they try to determine if they can get into the tourist venue and prepare for any possible occurrences on trip [ 38 ]. Similarly, previous tourism scholars have noted that planning and accurate, honest information are essential for tourism customers [ 30 39 ]. Accessible tourists need to ensure they have prepared and packed any required equipment that may be needed for the trip. They sometimes may bring specific accessible equipment or resources to assist their visit. Having clear, detailed, and easily accessible information communicating the accessibility of the venue greatly assists the planning of the access consumer. Availability of clear, accurate communications ensures access consumers can enjoy their trip, activity, or venue.\nTransparent information on an organization\u2019s communication channels provides a relatively inexpensive change for the sector to implement. During the planning process the access consumer extensively researches, considers, and plans their tourist trip with as much information about the tourist venue as they can source. They are seeking to identify how accessible the accommodation, transport, and activities are at the venue and if it would be suitable for their needs [ 52 ]. In addition to knowing what is available, the access consumer also needs to be able to identify what is not at the venue so they can prepare any equipment that they may need. Therefore, the availability of clear information that is communicated via a variety of channels and especially online information is an essential information resource for the access consumer. These types of communications can provide accurate information for a person with access needs to make informed decisions about what to expect at their travel destinations and to ensure they experience a pleasurable trip [ 30 ].\n21,17,19,26, All our participants mentioned the extensive information and research search they conduct before deciding to go on a local tourist trip. For example, interview participant 4 said that in order for her to have a relaxing and stress free experience, she need to have conducted extensive pre-planning before the trip. She mentioned how she would begin researching a trip a year in advance so that it would give her enough time to collect, contact, and research information. Previous scholars have also noted in their research that access consumers will conduct extensive research to reduce uncertainties and ensure they are prepared for the trip [ 17 22 ]. Information searches become essential for planning around what the tourist venue has to offer the access consumer and also identify what the access consumer needs to pack to enjoy the trip. Many of our participants had huge folders compiled with information that they had gathered before booking or planning any trip. Previous studies have also indicated that clear, accurate information is essential for the access consumer to gain an expectation of what is at the venue and importantly, what they need to bring along to ensure they can be included [ 12 27 ].\nEvery access individual has different needs, which would reflect the type of information required. To be clear here, however, the sector is not expected to provide a diverse range of equipment for all accessible needs. Instead, if they can clearly communicate what they can provide at the venue and what is not available, then the consumer can supplement with their own resources. Unfortunately, this is not always the case, as interviewee participant 7 stated that a local tourist destination, for example, does not have a lot of information about the level of accessibility for getting around the venue. This, the interviewee noted, made it difficult to determine whether the venue was safe and what to prepare for when packing for the trip.\n19,20, A relatively inexpensive solution for the sector is to develop clearer information on their communication channels. In order to understand what type of expectations the access consumer would seek, communications dialogues with local stakeholders could help to develop the sector\u2019s understandings. This could be achieved by collaborating and developing regular networks and planning sessions with local access organizations. The access organizations could then inform and develop the tourist sector\u2019s understandings of what to include in their communication and what to clearly state that they do not provide. For instance, some might require information in relation to where there would be grass for their guide dog to walk around or if the accommodation offers room service. If this information was not communicated, then, as one of our participants describes it, it is a case of \u201cpotluck\u201d (interview participant 6) and hoping for the best. In situations where people could not access information, then they would decide not to attend. This conclusion that our participants stated reflects similar findings in the accessibility tourism literature too [ 17 21 ].\nDeveloping trustworthy relationships with travel agents was identified as crucial for our participants. Interview participant 5 mentioned that the local access organization has a travel center that they use to book trips. They felt they could trust and be confident that this blind and low vision advocacy organization had screened particular providers. For instance, the travel centers that were endorsed by the access organization are provided with training and key questions to ask providers in order to assess the tourist providers suitability. These questions ranged from: was it accessible? Did they orientate access consumers on arrival to the accommodation? Did they have accessible online services? Many of these questions able bodied people would probably take for granted but are essential for the access tourist. Interview participant 7 said that people need to know how to ask the right questions in order to get the information that is most useful to you. However, rather than people with access requirements having to learn to ask the right questions or rely on others to find the information; tourism organizations and their websites could be easily be equipped to answer all those questions through the click of a button.\nThere were several of our participants that said they preferred to use travel agents to help book trips overseas. They stated that travel agents tend to have extensive networks to tourist providers and are quicker at finding information for the access consumer. Interview participant 3 said that familiarizing yourself with a travel agent in order to form a trusting relationship was beneficial for both parties. The agent could gain a richer and more in-depth understanding of the access consumer expectations, and the information search workload for the access consumer was reduced. This extra training ensured that the travel agent was trusted to ask the appropriate access questions and make bookings appropriate for the person\u2019s access needs [ 17 ]. All of our participants mentioned that once they found a travel agent or tourism provider that met their expectations, they become loyal to that business.\nThe problem with booking through a travel agent, however, was that they too rely on information provided by tourism organizations. As mentioned previously, this information may be limited or not consider the diversity of access consumers. For example, online interview participants 4 and 5 similarly noted instances where a hotel might say that it is accessible, but when reaching the destination, participants realized it is only accessible for wheelchair users and not for people with sight impairments. If that organization met the needs of the person, many of our access participants in the study stated they would frequently visit and become loyal to venue or accommodation provider. Participants commented that loyalty developed because they developed a relationship with this organization who had gained an understanding of their expectations and kept information about their needs on the organization\u2019s database.\nInformation online was identified in our participants\u2019 experience as often too vague or general regarding how the accessibility of the venue or assumptions were made that accessibility related only to wheelchair users. Participant one in the interview stated that they would never consider venturing off and would only go to places that are familiar and accessible. This restricts the number of places that people with access requirements can visit. Every trip or move needs to be pre-planned so that they are able to ensure a positive experience and have a good peace of mind knowing that they are prepared [ 30 31 ]. Interviewee participant 3 stated that people with access requirements have this \u201chopeful desire and expectation of being able to turn up anywhere to participate in tourism just like a normal person\u201d. As many of our participants lamented, unfortunately, this is not always the case in New Zealand.\nAll participants stated that they needed to spend an inordinate amount of time researching the destination they plan to visit to avoid any factors that might potentially ruin the experience. It is crucial for people with access requirements that information is clear, accurate, and states what is there and not provided. Too often, the information assumes that disability only relates to wheelchair users. People with access requirements wish to have \u201call the information and let us make the decision\u201d to gain independence, as participant 6 stated in their interview, but far too often, decisions are made for them rather than with them or by them. Collaborating with local access organizations was suggested as an inexpensive solution for the tourist sector. This collaborating would develop a broader awareness for the sector of the access consumers\u2019 needs and expectations. The benefits gained from this collaboration are that tourism experiences meet the basic requirements and could even exceed these needs to become enjoyable, resulting in loyalty from the access consumer to that tourism provider."}, {"title": "How to make public transport accessible and inclusive for all", "article": "Today is the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, a day set out to raise awareness about the problems people with disabilities face in everyday life.\nApproximately 15% of the world\u2019s population lives with some form of disability and, by 2030 more than 46% of people over the age of 60 will be classified as disabled. As public transport should serve everyone, the sector needs to focus its attention on meeting the needs of all passengers.\nFair and just mobility is referenced in the 2020 European Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy as a key priority, and UITP is proud to be a partner of the EU-funded TRIPS project (tRansport Innovation for vulnerable-to-exclusion People needs Satisfaction), which is doing great work to advance the experience for passengers with disabilities."}, {"title": null, "article": null}, {"title": "Fostering an inclusive urban-transit system", "article": "Using public transport can be stressful and even unsafe for many commuters, including but not limited to women, senior citizens, and people with disabilities. From minor annoyances to violent crimes, getting from point A to B can be fraught with risk.\nGoal 11 of the United Nations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sustainable development goals exhorts member states to provide safe, affordable, and accessible transportation for everyone, especially those who find themselves in vulnerable situations. And yet, while disparate initiatives have been launched around the world to make public commutes safer and accessible for everyone, a survey of the United Nations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and other international agencies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 research, plus our own analysis, suggests there is still more to be done across the three main stages of the commuter journey: planning and booking, the predeparture experience at boarding areas, and the travel itself.\nIn this article, we consider just how inclusive global public-transit systems are and explore ways that municipalities, urban planners, and other key stakeholders can assess and accommodate the end-to-end needs of all travelers.\nHow inclusive are our public-transit systems?\nOver the past decade, international organizations such as the United Nations have made the concerted effort to study inclusivity in urban-transport systems as a means to guarantee fair opportunities for all commuters. The insights that have come out of this endeavor fall under two broad themes.\nFirst, a collection of studies\u00e2\u0080\u0094including the UN Commission on the Status of Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Safe cities and safe public spaces for women and girls study\u00e2\u0080\u0094provide analyses of the key safety and communications issues that public-transport operators need to address. These include reducing violence and harassment on public transit, ensuring safer nighttime commutes, and providing clear, effective, around-the-clock communication between operators and travelers.\nSecond, a separate stream of research studies the main barriers that limit inclusion on public transit for women, people with disabilities, and low-income travelers, among others. Critical obstacles include, among others, poorly designed transportation, high ticket prices, inadequate safety regulations, and schedules that fail to account for the travel patterns of commuters with specific needs.\nAs they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve become aware of these issues and limitations, many public-transit system providers and urban planners have launched initiatives to address them\u00e2\u0080\u0094to limited effect, however. Such campaigns and programs have typically been introduced in an ad hoc manner rather than integrated into the overall public-transport system.\nSome cities, such as Los Angeles and Santiago, focused on surveying travel patterns of public-transit users, while others, including a major European capital and a large city in Southeast Asia, mostly worked on communication campaigns to raise awareness of nighttime safety. Other cities\u00e2\u0080\u0099 efforts were limited in scope. In Madrid, for example, on-demand bus stops were introduced on suburban routes during specific times to reduce the walking distance home for female passengers.\nFrom booking to travel: An end-to-end approach to inclusion\nShare From the inside out: Inclusion in the urban-transport workforce According to the latest Kantar Inclusion Index, less than half of transportation employees believe that their organizations are actively pursuing inclusion. In addition, the sector reports above-average workplace bullying/harassment and situations in which employees were made to feel uncomfortable. Fostering greater inclusion for public-transport employees requires providers to start with an accurate assessment of where they stand. Then, they can begin embarking on diversity, equity, and inclusion\u00c2 (DEI) transformation journeys to reshape their way of working. Diversity refers to workforce composition across various identity-related characteristics, such as gender, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, and disabilities. Equity focuses on ensuring that identity is not predictive of opportunities or workplace outcomes. Inclusion refers to the degree to which an individual feels that they can bring their authentic selves to work, enabling them to contribute in a meaningful and deliberate manner. From our experience working in this space, public-transport providers can gain DEI awareness in different ways. Sometimes targeted, eye-opening workshops aimed at uncovering deeply rooted unconscious bias represent a wake-up call for organizations: having diverse subsets of colleagues collaborate to identify unexpected biases in their ways of thinking is sometimes sufficient to trigger top-management engagement toward a new way of working. In other cases, transport agencies go even further and fully train their staff on civil-rights issues, among others, and on potential biases toward underrepresented categories. In other cases, achieving a profound understanding of the internal level of inclusivity can require more time and various sessions at all levels of the organization. Once companies agree that room for improvement exists, the journey to a fully inclusive work environment unfolds. After the first step of assessing and building the fact base through company-specific business cases, other challenging steps of the process remain: Architect (development of key performance indicators and road map): beginning with a solid awareness and understanding of the internal level of inclusion, companies develop a plan by designing a portfolio of initiatives linked to specific and tangible objectives, prioritizing them on feasibility and expected impact. The initiatives plan is complemented by the identification of pilots to be launched and tested, either on selected perimeters or on a company-wide basis.\nAct (test and learn with quick programs): companies start launching pilots and initiatives on target business units, functions, and geographies, in line with the agreed-upon implementation plan. As the plan unfolds, insights from pilots can be used to learn and refine ongoing and future initiatives.\nAdvance (build on success and track progress): in the core phase of the implementation, companies get the program to full scale. This requires a strong monitoring and accountability structure, alongside a proven knowledge codification and sharing system to constantly improve idea generation and the implementation of initiatives. Among public-transportation providers, one of the most notable programs in the past few years was launched by the roads and transport authority in a major city in the Middle East, which focused on including and elevating women\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, it created a dedicated fund for high-performing women employees and another initiative for \u00e2\u0080\u009cpeople of determination,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which included ad hoc employment and training programs.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time for urban-transport providers to draw from our collective understanding of inclusion and design and implement an urban-transport system that works for everyone. While this article focuses on the customer journey, travel providers should not miss the opportunity to transform their own organizations as well (see sidebar, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom the inside out: Inclusion in the urban-transport workforce\u00e2\u0080\u009d).\nTo further contribute to our existing understanding of travel and inclusion, we conducted our own research. We surveyed more than 20 different public-transport operators around the world and identified key requirements and initiatives for an inclusive public-transport system. We found that while there are many initiatives to enhance inclusion, they are typically not part of an integrated, 360-degree framework. We believe that a comprehensive and integrated approach to inclusive transportation comprises initiatives that fall into six categories (Exhibit 1).\n1\nWe mapped these requirements and initiatives along the commuter journey, which we broke down into three parts: the booking stage, the predeparture stage, and the actual travel experience (Exhibit 2). In each phase, there are actions travel providers can take to address specific pain points. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll explore those actions using the example of a rail-based journey\u00e2\u0080\u0094although the conceptual principles here can be applied to other forms of urban transport, such as buses and ferries.\n2\nThe booking stage\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s common nowadays for people to use navigation apps to find the most convenient route to their destination. The would-be passenger decides on the starting and arrival points, preferred mode of transport, and time of travel. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll factor in potential route disruptions (and explore alternatives, if necessary), how crowded the commute might be, and whether there are any loyalty-program benefits to be accrued.\nThis stage presents a number of potential pain points for some commuters. For instance, a wheelchair user may not know if a train station is equipped with elevators and if there are design barriers that may make it difficult to board and alight from a train.\nSome cities have tried to create a more accessible and safe experience for senior travelers. For instance, Salzburg has launched initiatives to promote the use of public transport among older people. The city has hosted \u00e2\u0080\u009cmobility days,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and pamphlets on commuter safety can be found in all train stations. Salzburg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bus drivers are also trained to be extra vigilant around older passengers, and vehicles are designed with senior citizens in mind. These initiatives have reduced accidents among older people and increased awareness among the remaining population.\nOur research points to a number of actions urban-transport providers can take at the booking and planning stage to create more inclusion. For instance, they could create pooling options in their travel apps so that passengers could choose to commute in groups. They may offer special rates at this stage as well, to disabuse people of the idea that accessible travel options are more expensive than standard ones. Passengers could also be given the option to easily share their itinerary with their friends and loved ones for an additional layer of oversight.\nTravel providers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 mobile apps may also provide a direct line of communication between the traveler and the provider and are a tool providers may want to use more strategically. Safety issues could be flagged immediately. Information about security measures, optimal travel times, and easy-access facilities could be relayed through this channel when passengers check and confirm their itinerary. The Transport for London, for instance, allows for just this with its dedicated journey planner; the app lets would-be passengers optimize their journey from the booking stage.\nPredeparture phase\nArriving at a station or terminal can be an overwhelming experience, with hordes of people crisscrossing in every possible direction\u00e2\u0080\u0094businesspeople rushing to catch their trains with barely minutes to spare, families trying to herd rowdy children toward the right platform, and buskers plying their craft.\nFor many, the predeparture phase looks like this: you receive a push notification from your travel provider with information about your train\u00e2\u0080\u0099s departure time. To get to the platform you go through a thermal-imaging scanner that checks your temperature, you make it past the turnstile with an electronic ticket, and you find the correct platform, where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll wait to board.\nFor groups or travelers with specific logistical needs, this phase can be full of hazards. If they are early for their train, for instance, such passengers may find few accessible waiting spaces to accommodate them.\nThere are a number of ways urban-travel providers can improve the predeparture experience for all travelers. They may want to integrate important safety and pooling information into the departure reminder, noting the location of accessible facilities and safe train cars\u00e2\u0080\u0094carriages with an attendant, conductor, or security officer. Visual \u00e2\u0080\u009cnudges\u00e2\u0080\u009d and cues could promote positive behaviors, such as offering assistance to people with mobility constraints or to pregnant women. In stations where longer wait times are common, more rooms for nursing mothers and a greater number of dedicated waiting areas could be created. Treating the station as a civic space by promoting community-focused activities\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as increasing retail outlets and installing open pianos\u00e2\u0080\u0094could also enhance commuters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sense of safety.\nIn 2006, the city of Graz, Austria, upgraded its key stops to make them both more accessible and livable; and, targeting both safety and comfort in its train platforms and stations, the Canadian cities of Ottawa and Toronto created designated Transecure waiting areas.\nTraveling and arriving at the destination\nThere are a number of actions travel providers can take to make passengers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 journeys inclusive once they are on board. For instance, it is possible for travelers on most trains to track their progress while en route\u00e2\u0080\u0094but it may not always be clear how to request help in cases of violence of harassment. Particularly when it comes to late-night routes, passengers may be in near-empty train cars. To provide peace of mind for all passengers, urban-travel planners should install highly visible GPS panic buttons throughout the system, as they have in New Delhi and Bangalore.\nCommuters with specific needs could be directed to the train\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safe wagons with security personnel and closer supervision. Pregnant women or passengers with specific physical needs could wear \u00e2\u0080\u009cMay I sit\u00e2\u0080\u009d pins to alert other commuters to give way to them. Travel providers could also make it easier for these commuters to find information about connections and the safest ways to get to the next boarding point.\nWhile our case study focuses on rail travel, alternative transport modes may offer other opportunities for greater inclusion. The flexibility afforded by bus travel presents more options for making the travel experience safer. Passengers could be allowed to alight, on request, at specific time slots, for example, from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m., to reduce the distance between the drop-off point to the final destination. This is exactly what the city of Madrid put in place, arranging on-demand night bus stops on interurban bus lines.\nCreating an inclusive urban-transport system doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop the moment a passenger gets off the train. Transport providers could review the arrival experiences and partner with security companies to provide additional support or with taxi and rideshare companies to provide special rates for arriving passengers.\nSetting the goal of an entirely accessible public-transport system is becoming increasingly common in major cities worldwide. Barcelona has committed to a 100 percent accessible underground metro system by 2024, and Seattle is already fully wheelchair accessible.\nOther municipalities and travel providers can do the same by undertaking a thorough assessment of customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 needs along the whole journey, mapping the potential pain points, and implementing targeted initiatives to address them. Of course, this process is an iterative one; any initiatives launched should be evaluated and refined over time. The systemic, end-to-end approach outlined in this article should help make traveling in our cities truly safer for all."}, {"title": "Improving Transport Accessibility for All: Guide to Good Practice", "article": "Making transport vehicles and infrastructure more accessible to everyone continues to be both an important objective and a major challenge for transport authorities, operators and service providers worldwide.\nAccessibility has long been considered as a transport concern only for individuals with particular mobility diffi culties. But it is now increasingly recognized as an integral part of high-quality, sustainable transport systems, with benefi ts accruing to all clients.\nMuch has been done to improve the accessibility of transport systems in recent years. One of the key factors in progress has been the indispensable exchange of experience \u2013 both good and less successful \u2013 among countries having committed to working towards better accessibility.\nThe ECMT has prepared this Guide to Good Practice in order to facilitate such an exchange of experience.

Typically, the vehicles are minivans or something similar, and the rates are usually the same as a standard UberX. Keep in mind that these aren\u2019t available in every city, so if you\u2019re considering using ride-sharing on your trip, make sure you research to see if it\u2019s a viable option at your destination. At this time, some of the current cities where WAV is offered and has solid availability:\nNew York\nSan Francisco\nPortland\nBoston\nSeattle\nToronto\nWheelchair accessible transportation in Costa Rica\nAccessible Public Transportation\nMany public transportation systems offer wheelchair accessible options, such as buses and trains, while others offer paratransit services for those who are unable to use traditional public transportation. It is important to plan ahead and research the accessibility options in your area because not all public transportation systems are fully accessible.\nIn the U.S, public transportation is not accessible in every destination:\nBus transportation is accessible in almost every city, but can be very ineffective due to the lack of coverage in many cases. Research the bus routes at your destination and see if it would be a good option for you.\nThe San Francisco BART is almost 100% accessible. Every station has elevators, and although they are not very clean, it covers a majority of the city.\nOutside of the U.S there are many cities that we have identified with good public transportation. A few examples are:\nBarcelona, Spain - Great train and bus systems that are fully accessible.\nLondon, England - The buses have great accessibility and the Underground has a number of accessible stations, especially the ones around downtown.\nBerlin, Germany - Most subway stations are accessible.\nSantiago, Chile - The majority of subway stations and buses are accessible. Staying in the Vitacura/Providencia area of the city will allow you to use the subway and buses and go around accessible areas of the city.\nWheelchair lift into public transportation (bus)\nWheelchair Accessible Dispatch Taxis\nWheelchair-accessible dispatch taxi services are another great option for those who require specialized transportation. These services allow users to schedule a ride in an accessible taxi that has been designed to accommodate wheelchair users. These services can be scheduled in advance, allowing you to plan you transportation needs more conveniently. However, it's important to keep in mind that not every destination may offer these services, so it's important to research your options in advance.\nConclusion\nAlthough finding accessible transportation can be a challenge, there are several options available to wheelchair users. By exploring these alternatives, you can find the transportation option that works best for your needs and helps you maintain your independence and mobility.

Ask specifically about wheelchair access, elevators or ramps, accessible rooms with adequate toilets, and other services for visitors with disabilities Secondly, it is also important to know where accommodations are available.

It's the very charm of Europe \u2014 old and well preserved \u2014 that often adds to its barriers. But Europe has made some impressive advances toward opening its doors to everyone, including travelers with limited mobility.\nWherever I go in Europe, I see locals using wheelchairs, scooters, walkers, and canes to get around \u2014 on the streets, in museums, in restaurants, on trains. Even though Europe generally lacks accessibility requirements with the force or scope of the ADA, Europeans with limited mobility are, of course, living rich and full lives. Clearly, travelers with physical disabilities can certainly have an enjoyable and worthwhile vacation there, too.\nAnyone with adventure in their soul can take advantage of what Europe has to offer. Consider your own situation thoughtfully in choosing which attractions to visit, which hotels to sleep in, which restaurants to dine at...and which things you might want to avoid.\nTrip Planning\nJohn Sage owns Sage Traveling, which plans and books accessible travel to Europe for senior and disabled travelers. John has taken his wheelchair to more than 120 European cities and has run into his share of challenges during his travels \u2014 but he also says that the obstacles can almost always be overcome. Here, I've included excerpts, in John's own words, from his top tips for traveling in Europe.\nDo your research. I often hear that \"Venice is not wheelchair accessible\" or \"Paris has poor accessibility.\" While there are certainly some accessibility challenges, the truth is that the more research you do, the more accessible your trip will be. Avoiding bridges in Venice and hills in Paris is entirely possible. Did you know that Herculaneum's ruins are nearly identical to Pompeii's, but are wheelchair-friendly? And that cruise passengers with disabilities can enjoy incredible experiences such as reaching the top of the Acropolis in Athens or entering the Sistine Chapel in Rome by using specially designed wheelchair lifts? Your vacation doesn't need to be a struggle. Do your homework and your trip can be filled with fully accessible hotel accommodations, accessible routes between accessible tourist attractions, and wonderfully accessible travel experiences.\nBook hotels far in advance. It is almost always cheaper to book your accessible hotel accommodation far in advance. And it is also necessary! Many hotels in European city centers have only one or two accessible rooms. The best ones get booked very early. For travel in the summer, make your reservations in December. Remember, a hotel's accessibility status does not only depend on its interior features such as elevators, grab bars and roll-in showers. The location is just as important.\nCarefully plan your route. If you know what you're getting into before you arrive in Europe, you'll have a much easier and enjoyable time on your trip. There'll likely be numerous ways to get to the tourist attractions you're so eager to see. Some routes will have wheelchair ramps, smooth pavement, and flat terrain; others may have steep hills, bothersome (and even dangerous) cobblestones, and flights of stairs. Research the accessibility of sidewalks, bus routes, subway stations, and the location of accessible building entrances before your trip. Check for accessibility information in the online visitors guides for your destinations \u2014 but be aware that not all guides will offer this type of information and some of them may be outdated as access features change all the time.\nStay in the most accessible parts of town. This is one of the hardest parts of planning your trip. You may have found a great accessible hotel, but what will you find when you walk (or roll) out the front door? Are there hills and stairs in all directions? Will you have to roll over cobblestones? Are there accessible restaurants nearby? It's crucial to research the hotel's neighborhood. You can use Google Maps' Street View to get the lay of the land, then email the hotel with your questions.\nFigure out accessible public transportation options. When choosing a hotel, don't forget to factor in the price of transportation. If you have to pay for a taxi to get to accessible restaurants, accessible shopping, and the tourist attractions, that hotel \"deal\" you found won't feel like such a good deal after all. In cities such as London, Paris, and Barcelona, stay near an accessible bus stop. In Berlin, Istanbul, and Venice, stay near an accessible metro, tram, or boat stop. In Florence, Cambridge, and Edinburgh, stay right in the middle of town so you can walk/roll everywhere.\nRely on the experience of other travelers with disabilities. You're certainly not the first person with disabilities to visit Europe. Find out what accessibility challenges other travelers encountered and how they got around them. Check recent posts at travel forums such as Trip Advisor and Cruise Critic to find previous travelers' experiences. Or seek out a travel agent who specializes in accessible travel. You can also find accessibility reviews of multiple European destinations at Sage Traveling.\nHave a backup plan. Even on the most perfectly planned accessible vacation, something can go wrong. If it does, how will you deal with it? If you prepare for all the possible problems, travel with someone who can help you during your trip, and remain flexible, unexpected events won't turn into potential trip-ruining problems. What will you do if a part on your wheelchair breaks? If a train strike occurs in Italy, how will you get from Florence to Rome? With backup plans (such as packing vital spare parts for your wheelchair), you won't have to put your vacation on hold.\nConsider a tour. A company that specializes in accessibility will lead you on the flattest, smoothest, shortest tour routes.\nBefore you take a tour or hire a guide, ask these questions:\nIs the tour guide a licensed professional? How much training has the guide received?\nWhat route will the guide use? Does it involve curbs, steps, steep hills, or cobblestones? Where are the accessible bathrooms located? Will the guide physically assist you if needed (for example, push a manual wheelchair)?\nIs this a private tour, or will you be with other travelers? Are you expected to keep up with more able-bodied tour members?\nHow many people with disabilities have they guided in the past year? (You want a guide who is active enough to be aware of the latest regulations or updates regarding accessibility.)\nAnticipate your trip! You've done as much planning as you can. You've relied on the experience of other travelers with disabilities, and you're prepared for the unexpected. Now it's time to get excited about your trip. Majestic cities, beautiful art and architecture, fascinating history, exquisite food, and wonderful experiences await you.\nMore Tips for Wheelchair Users\nSusan Sygall is the CEO and cofounder of Mobility International USA, a nonprofit that links people with disabilities with work, study, teaching, volunteer, exchange, and research opportunities.

Whether you travel alone, with friends, or with an assistant, you're in for a great adventure.\nPack light. I use a lightweight manual wheelchair with pop-off tires. I take a backpack that fits on the back of my chair and I store my daypack underneath my chair in a net bag. Since I usually travel alone, if I can't carry it myself, I don't take it.\nPlan for eventualities. I keep a bungee cord with me for the times I can't get my chair into a car and need to strap it in the trunk or when I need to secure it on a train. Bike shops are excellent for tire repairs if you get a flat.\nCheck your chair at the gate. I always insist on keeping my own wheelchair up to the airline gate, where I then check it. When I have a connecting flight, I again insist that I use my own chair.\nDon't let bathroom access stop you. Bathrooms are often a hassle, so I have learned to use creative ways to transfer into narrow spaces. To be blatantly honest, when there are no accessible bathrooms in sight, I have found ways to pee discreetly just about anywhere. You gotta do what you gotta do. Bring along an extra pair of pants and a great sense of humor.\nLook for freight elevators. If a museum lacks elevators for visitors, be sure to ask about freight elevators. Almost all have them somewhere, and that can be your ticket to seeing a world-class treasure.\nLet wheelchairs help you. People who have difficulty walking long distances may want to bring a lightweight wheelchair or borrow or rent one when needed.\nInsist on your rights. Don't confuse being flexible and having a positive attitude with settling for less than your rights. I expect equal access and constantly let people know about the possibility of providing access through ramps or other modifications. When I believe my rights have been violated, I do whatever is necessary to remedy the situation, so that the next traveler or disabled person in that country won't have the same frustrations.\nBreak down barriers. Try to learn some of the language of the country you're in. It cuts through the barriers when people stare at you (and they will), and also comes in handy when you need help going up a curb or a flight of steps.\nLearn from locals. Remember that you are part of a global family of people with disabilities. Always get information about disability groups in the places you are going. See the sidebar in this page for a number of helpful organizations. They have the best access information, and many times they'll become your new traveling partners and friends.\nWhat Accessibility Means in Europe\nThis section was contributed by Carole Zoom, who has traveled to more than 30 countries with her scooter-style electric wheelchair and ventilator.\nThe concept of accessibility varies by culture. In the US, access means that an individual can use elevators, lifts, doors, entrances, and other features without any assistance. Individual autonomy is central to the American concept of access, as enshrined in the ADA.\nEurope, on the other hand, subscribes to a medical rather than political model of disability. Policy tends to be focused on helping people with disabilities navigate a society built for nondisabled individuals \u2014 instead of helping society find ways to accommodate their needs. For example, in Europe an entryway with one step is considered accessible: The law assumes that disabled people will use manual wheelchairs that can be rolled up a step and/or will have family members assisting.\nIn the US it's illegal to discriminate based on what kind of mobility device a wheelchair user chooses. But in Europe, mobility scooter users have fewer rights than wheelchair users; scooters are seen not as a medical necessity, but as a convenience item for people who can still walk to some extent. Scooter-style wheelchairs are not allowed in some museums and other public facilities \u2014 you may be asked to walk if you can or to transfer to a manual wheelchair. If those are not options for you, be persistent in explaining your situation to museum staff.\nGiven the age of many buildings in Europe, elevator access is often not a reality. A US citizen would assume a hotel is accessible upon hearing that it has an elevator. But many older European elevators are not large enough for American-style electric wheelchairs and scooters. Before you book a room, ask the hotel concierge for photos and exact measurements to ensure your style and size of wheelchair will fit. A hotel that hesitates to provide the info or photos you request is unlikely to be accommodating; in that case, move on and choose another.\nUnlike in the US, European transit companies that operate planes, ships, trains, and buses may require advanced documentation of disability. If you need specific assistance, have your doctor fill out forms attesting to your needs before you travel, then contact the transit provider's medical desk at least 72 hours before your departure to ask how to submit them. Always confirm and reconfirm your reservations for assistance on all modes of advanced-ticketed transport.\nWe have an increasingly barrier-free world. But Americans going abroad need to be more aware and vigilant about accessibility than they are used to at home."}, {"title": "Traveling with Disabilities", "article": "This site is managed by the U.S. Department of State.

Since then, the Carrollton, Texas\u2013based company has hosted a variety of trips both on land and at sea. Plus, as a travel agency, it helps clients plan and book both domestic and international travel, with Hawaii and New England topping the list for U.S. getaways.\nKerper\u2019s philosophy for serving her special client base is simple: \u201cEliminating surprises and informing clients of possible situations remain paramount for successful planning,\u201d she says.\nJust two of the many ways the company ensures client satisfaction are by using guides in each locale who are accustomed to working with special-needs travelers, and by following routes for various excursions that are specially designed to be easily navigated by wheelchair users. It currently has accessible staterooms set aside for an Alaskan cruise this summer and for a Mediterranean cruise in October, both with Royal Caribbean.

They can help you get destination-specific vaccines, medicines, and information. Discussing your health concerns, itinerary, and planned activities with your provider allows them to give more specific advice and recommendations.\nGet travel insurance. Find out if your health insurance covers medical care abroad. Travelers are usually responsible for paying hospital and other medical expenses out of pocket at most destinations. Make sure you have a plan to get care overseas, in case you need it. Consider buying additional insurance that covers health care and emergency evacuation, especially if you will be traveling to remote areas.\nEnroll with the Department of State\u2019s Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP). Check for and monitor any travel advisories for your destination. Enrolling also ensures that the US Department of State knows where you are if you have serious legal, medical, or financial difficulties while traveling. In the event of an emergency at home, STEP can also help friends and family contact you.\nPrepare a travel health kit with items you may need, especially those items that may be difficult to find at your destination. Include your prescriptions and over-the-counter medicines in your travel health kit and take enough to last your entire trip, plus extra in case of travel delays. Depending on your destination you may also want to pack a mask, insect repellent, sunscreen (SPF15 or higher), aloe, alcohol-based hand sanitizer, water disinfection tablets, and your health insurance card.\nCarry your medical alert information and a letter from your health care professional describing any medical conditions, medications, and potential complications.\nResearch the availability of wheelchairs and other medical equipment. Consider renting a wheelchair and any medical equipment at your destination. Websites such as Mobility International USA and the European Network for Accessible Tourism provide information on overseas medical equipment providers.\nConsiderations for Air Travel\nU.S. airlines and flights to or from the United States on a foreign carrier must provide all travelers with the same travel opportunities, regardless of disability, unless doing so would endanger the health or safety of other passengers and crew.\nSome airlines may require up to 48 hours advance notice and 1-hour advance check-in for certain accommodations. Check with your airline for more information. Airlines are required to provide people with disabilities access to the aircraft, an aisle seat, and a seat with a removable armrest.\nIf you plan to fly within a foreign country or between countries while abroad, the regulations above might not apply. Check with the airline to find out what accommodations it makes for people with disabilities.\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation has a toll-free hotline, 800-778-4838 (voice) or 800-455-9880 (TTY), for more information about the rights of air travelers with disabilities. Also, check federal relay 711 or the Transportation Security Administration\u2019s website for answers to questions about screening policies, procedures, and checkpoints. Find out if there are specific policies for devices such as wheelchairs, portable machines, batteries, respirators, and oxygen.\nConsiderations for Cruise Ship Travel\nMost cruise ships can accommodate travelers with disabilities. Check with the cruise line before booking to make sure any accommodations you\u2019ll need are available, such as medical oxygen or a wheelchair. Some cruises cater to travelers with special needs, such as patients on dialysis.\nTraveling with Service Animals\nMost airlines allow a trained service animal to accompany a qualified individual with a disability. Be sure to check with your airline to ensure that your service animal meets the airline\u2019s requirements, including necessary documentation. Service animals may not be allowed to enter all countries and are subject to animal importation regulations, such as quarantine regulations. Your service animal will also be subject to US animal import regulations when flying to the United States. Prior to traveling with your service animal, find out what documents and testing may be required to enter another country and return to the United States.\nContact the US embassy or consulate of the destination country for information on possible restrictions for service animals and any quarantine, vaccination, and documentation requirements.\nConsult a veterinarian prior to your trip and ask about tips for traveling with service animals.\nContact destination hotels to make sure they will allow service animals.\nAfter Travel\nIf you traveled and feel sick, particularly if you have a fever, talk to a healthcare provider and tell them about your travel.

The special issue explores theoretical approaches, foundations and issues in the study of accessible tourism from a futures perspective. Accessible tourism, as with any area of academic study is an evolving field of academic research and industry practice, set within a dynamic social context. The field is interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary, and is influenced by geography, ageing and disability studies, economics, public policy, psychology, law, architecture, construction sciences, technology and marketing. Past research has attempted to view, explain and unpack the inherent complexities (Darcy, 2010) within accessible tourism through a variety of lenses, including human rights, critical tourism, embodiment, customer segmentation and universal design (UD), to name a few (see Buhalis and Darcy, 2011; Buhalis et al., 2012). The special issue is timely given the operationalisation of the United Nations (2006) Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities by 160 countries. Central to the convention is the right for tourists with disability to access transport and built environment in Article 9 and tourism experiences, goods and services within Article 30. It is therefore pertinent to look at the future of accessible tourism and contemplate a number of issues including (but not limited to) the role of technology in reshaping disability; if and how policy makers and planners are addressing the impact of accessible tourism in a sustainable manner; the political influence of people with disabilities, who make up the largest minority group in the USA, on the future of tourism; the science fiction of exoskeletons and gene therapy as a new form of adventure tourist; and the future state of embodied identity and accessible tourism. The special issue provides the opportunity for contributors to take part in the current discourses on accessible tourism from a futures perspective, in order that we can understand, manage and contribute to the development of accessible tourism in the context of economically, socially and environmentally sustainable communities. Specific topics included conceptual and research papers, viewpoints and trend papers, both qualitative and quantitative, discussing topics relating to the future of accessible tourism. Papers include a range of issues including: inclusive destinations; accessible tourism in Development Planning (toward the UN Sustainable Development Goals 2030); policy-making for accessible tourism; embodiment; representation; law and legislation; architecture and universal design; inclusion/exclusion from experiences; markets and needs analysis; accessible transport; accessible events; accessibility and culture/heritage; accessible accommodation; education/training; and technology and applications. In contrast to the past 30 years, where disability and tourism research has been largely concerned with overcoming barriers that exclude certain people (see Smith, 1987), we can discern the contours of new movements in accessible tourism, whereby overarching principles and standards of sustainability, social responsibility and customer service. The delivery of equitable tourism experiences demand the attention of sector actors and stakeholders. Accessible tourism, in this context, should be seen in the future as much more than a range of supports to excluded target groups, becoming a set of ground rules and codes of practice which contribute to the development of all tourism offers and destinations in an inclusive way. If we should gaze into the crystal ball for a moment, we could envisage that tourism will not be defined primarily in terms of different target groups, since principles of responsibility, sustainability and accessibility will in the future inform the quality criteria to which all destinations should comply and be judged as part of destination competitiveness in increasingly global context. Customers will become more aware of their individual rights and also the need to protect and sustain communities and the natural environment, influencing tourism service providers to follow generally accepted rules of service quality, genuine interactivity and engagement with the local culture, people and resources. The capability of tourism providers to recognise those rights for all (e.g. of tourists with disabilities, Design for All, responsible behaviour, inclusion of the local communities in a transparent system of remuneration and participation, working opportunities for socially excluded group etc.) is going to be the threshold, which determines whether their offers will succeed or fail in the future. The tourism sector will increasingly be seen as having transformational power as \u201ca shaper of society\u201d, acting as a promoter of jobs and economic growth, a participant in regional and community planning and a partner in global development programmes. In addition, tourism should be developed as industry that promotes understanding, inclusion and well-being for all in an equitable way. Businesses, destinations and networks, that are already active in the field of accessible tourism and/or representing markets with different specific requirements will participate more widely in the mainstream, bringing their expertise and knowledge to bear on all those issues that are still seen as \u201cdifferent types of tourism\u201d. In the development of accessible destinations and experiences, the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (2015) will be playing an increasingly supportive role, especially through its Global Code for Ethics in Tourism and the recently published Manuals on Accessible Tourism (2015), produced by ONCE Foundation and the European Network for Accessible Tourism (2015b). Before discussing the papers that have been selected for publication we would like to set the scene by examining some major conceptual and policy development areas that we believe will have a significant influence on accessible tourism futures in the future. These include: dreams and aspirations of people with disability; demography; UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; destination competitiveness frameworks; UD; and the newly adopted UN Sustainable Development Goals for 2030. Each of these areas of influence will now be outlined prior to the papers for the special edition being summarised for their contribution to the future of accessible tourism.\nDefining and conceptualising accessible tourism Conceptualising accessible tourism to reflect all its dimensions and multidisciplinarity is critical for the future. The study of tourism and disability has been a reasonably recent phenomenon with the first detailed examination emerging from the leisure constraints literature (Smith, 1987). From this beginning, a great deal of individual studies are emerged that documented significant issues with demand, supply and coordination of travel for people with disability. More recently the field has started to mature with a conceptualisation that has sought to make sense out of the individual studies and provide an overall framework for understanding the phenomena. To assist with this conceptualisation, Buhalis and Darcy (2011) offer the following definition: Accessible tourism is a form of tourism that involves collaborative processes between stakeholders that enables people with access requirements, including mobility, vision, hearing and cognitive dimensions of access, to function independently and with equity and dignity through the delivery of universally designed tourism products, services and environments. This definition adopts a whole of life approach where people through their lifespan benefit from accessible tourism provision. These include people with permanent and temporary disabilities, seniors, obese, families with young children and those working in safer and more socially sustainably designed environments (adapted from Darcy and Dickson, 2009, p. 34 in Buhalis and Darcy, 2011, pp. 10-11). Importantly the definition recognises collaboration between stakeholders across demand, supply and coordination to recognise that disability is a complex construct involving mobility, vision, hearing, cognitive and other embodiments. The definition recognises that developing inclusive destinations and accessible tourism experiences also benefit other groups in the community. Hence, it contributes toward a greater social sustainability of the industry by including and, hence, providing for a much broader cross-section of consumers that has previously been considered by the industry. In understanding the importance of individuals with disability, the stakeholders they engage with and the influence of UD on the products, services and environments they wish to seek enabling experiences. Buhalis and Darcy (2011) suggests that to develop accessible tourism futures destination managers must strategically plan through the lens of UD. Figure 1 outlines the cyclical strategic approach to engaging UD approaches across disability and lifespan considerations as a foundation for developing future accessible destination experiences.\nDreams and aspirations of people with disability The dreams and aspirations of individuals play a fundamental role in shaping the choices, which lead them to travel. Among people who live with a disability, the idea of leaving behind one\u2019s everyday surroundings and going on a journey can create significant anxiety (Darcy, 1998). People with disability often can design or influence their everyday environment whilst they have routines to negotiate any difficulties and thresholds that exist. This does not apply to new environments whilst travelling, where they do not have prior knowledge, networks or influence on the design nor the potential barriers that are to face and the way to overcome them. Indeed, a recent European survey (GfK, 2015) suggests that up to half of people with disability do not travel on holiday, due to a combination of lack of reliable information, lack of funds and previous bad experiences. Yet, the desire to travel remains with studies showing that it is not a person\u2019s impairment that impedes their travel but a series of interpersonal, attitudinal structural constraints (Daniels et al., 2005; Darcy, 2003). In recognising that a person's impairment does not constrain their travel motivations, the boundaries to what is regarded as accessible tourism destinations and experiences are continually pushed by the accessible explorers who forge new pathways for others to follow.\nMillennium development goals (MDGs) and the UN global compact At the Millennium Summit in September 2000 the largest gathering of world leaders in history adopted the UN Millennium Declaration, committing their nations to a global partnership to reduce extreme poverty and setting a series of targets, with a deadline of 2015. These targets, known as the MDGs are a set of eight specific goals set by the 191 United Nations member countries that have the goal of halving world poverty by the year 2015: Eradicating extreme poverty continues to be one of the main challenges of our time, and is a major concern of the international community. Ending this scourge will require the combined efforts of all, governments, civil society organizations and the private sector, in the context of a stronger and more effective global partnership for development. The Millennium Development Goals set timebound targets, by which progress in reducing income poverty, hunger, disease, lack of adequate shelter and exclusion \u2013 while promoting gender equality, health, education and environmental sustainability \u2013 can be measured. They also embody basic human rights \u2013 the rights of each person on the planet to health, education, shelter and security. The Goals are ambitious but feasible and, together with the comprehensive United Nations development agenda, set the course for the world\u2019s efforts to alleviate extreme poverty by 2015 (United Nations Secretary-General BAN Ki-moon). The aim of the MDGs is to encourage development by improving social and economic conditions in the world\u2019s poorest countries. Since the MDG\u2019s were agreed to significant progress has been made. To date average overall incomes have increased by approximately 21 per cent. The number of people living in extreme poverty declined by an estimated 130 million. Chile mortality rates fell from 103 deaths per 1,000 live births a year to 88. Life expectancy rose from 63 years to 65 years. An additional 8 per cent of the developing world\u2019s people received access to clean water and an additional 15 per cent acquired access to improved sanitation services. In 2015 the UN countries will adopt a new sustainable development agenda and a new global agreement on climate change. The actions taken in 2015 are expected to result in new sustainable development goals that build on the eight MDG\u2019s (United Nations, 2015). Tourism has long been seen as having significant potential to help achieve the MDG\u2019s in developing countries. For example in 1990 developing countries had 18 per cent of international tourism receipts. By 2005 this had risen to 30 per cent and to date it continues to rise. There has been significant promotion of the direct economic links between tourists and the poor. Tourism may provide employment opportunities for marginalised groups, may bring direct income to individual communities and may promote equality in developing countries (Saarinen and Rogerson, 2013).\nUD supports destination competitiveness The tourism industry needs to design and deliver offerings and services that are suitable to all potential users and remove any physical or organisational barriers that can prevent visitation. UD incorporates the accessibility requirements of people with the widest possible range of abilities, so that the greatest number of people can use mainstream products and services without the need for adaptations or special interfaces. Additionally, mainstream products and services should use interface standards which match those of technical aids, so allowing disabled people to access and use mainstream equipment. UD has been defined as: Universal design is the design of products and environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design. The intent of the universal design concept is to simplify life for everyone by making products, communications, and the built environment more usable by more people at little or no extra cost. The universal design concept targets all people of all ages, sizes and abilities\u2019. The Universal Design approach goes beyond traditional design, which tends to focus on the \u2018average\u2019 user. Universal Design is a design approach, reflecting a way of understanding people\u2019s needs. It is not a list of particular solutions, measurements, or products \u2013 Universal Design is the way to reach the solution, contributing to social inclusion (cited in Center for Universal Design, 2009; and first articulated by Mace, 1985). Applying the principles of UD can be seen as a way of developing tourism environments, transportation, services and offers, underpinning sustainable communities and businesses. Today, according to a recent study by European Network for Accessible Tourism (2015a) and partners, less than 10 per cent of tourism suppliers in Europe offer \u201caccessible\u201d tourism services, while demand for such services is set to increase due to the ageing population and continuing upward trend in market demand. Adopting UD enlarges the target markets of destinations as well as ensures that more pleasant experiences can be delivered. Therefore it can increase the market base, reduce seasonality and support the competitiveness of destinations (Buhalis, 2000). Yet, few studies have examined accessible tourism in relation to destination management and only recently has accessible tourism been examined from destination competitiveness perspective (Dom\u00ednguez Vila et al., 2015).\nPapers in this issue To address these concepts and developments this special issue is bringing a range of papers together that discuss research on many accessibility tourism aspects. Naniopoulos and Tsalis (2015) discuss a methodology for addressing the accessibility of monuments. They focus on heritage attraction sites, highlighting the challenges with archaeological sites where interventions become problematic or even impossible. In doing so, they approached accessibility as a dual notion; accessibility of an area and its potential for independent physical access and movement around the monuments as well as perceived accessibility in terms of interpreting, understanding and learning from the environment. The methodology was applied to a number of byzantine monuments as part of a cultural route in the city of Thessaloniki in Greece, as case studies. Results provide both tools for assessing monument accessibility (process orientations and checklists) and insights into the needs of travellers with disabilities for more \u201cusable\u201d heritage attractions. Concluding remarks place a focus on the prerequisites of training and cooperation to allow for the future of accessible monuments to be realised. Tsalis et al. (2015) provide an interesting study on the challenges of implementing accessibility solutions, also within the context of protection, conservation, and management of historical centres and monuments. Viewed from a tourism perspective, archaeological sites and monuments are location bound and exist only in their original place. Hence, access to such sites enables unique and authentic tourism experiences. Discourses on objective, constructive and existential authenticity are of paramount importance when accessibility is concerned. This study provides relevant examples of accessibility interventions on six monuments as well as considerations on the design of the tools that assisted site interpretation and interconnection in a cultural route. Results demonstrate how accessibility improvements can occur while respecting the history, architecture and character of the monuments. The study concludes by emphasizing that it is primarily through providing greater access, that the \u201csocialisation\u201d of these monuments will propagate authentic tourism experiences in the future. Bowtell (2015) offers an examination of the market value and attractiveness of accessible tourism in Europe. Historic data were used to provide a forecast for 2025, while primary data obtained from travel and leisure companies provided insights into managerial perceptions. Findings show a very promising potential for accessible tourism market with significant projected revenues. However, a number of challenges including lack of awareness, cost of investments, complexity of customers\u2019 needs and legal inconsistencies within the EU, create barriers toward developing comprehensive solutions for accessible tourism. Authors provide recommendations on bridging demand and supply. Gillovic and McIntosh (2015) present an interesting study on stakeholder perspectives of the future of accessible tourism in New Zealand. The study provides insights into the current situation and the future propensity for an accessible tourism industry in New Zealand. A number of interviews with key stakeholders revealed that there is a need to develop a culture of accessibility that is perceived as the norm. Findings also include the business and demand arguments, but additionally highlighted the \u201cineptness\u201d of upper industry levels to recognize the opportunity of accessible tourism, exhibiting apathy and complacency instead. Authors conclude with recommendations for the future of accessible tourism in New Zealand which can easily be generalised for other regions. Zajadacz (2015) discusses the evolution of models of disability as a basis for the future development of accessible tourism. A review of medical, social, biopsychosocial, geographical and economic models of disability reveals the theoretical underpinnings and assumptions entailed in those. These are then linked to tourism, demonstrating that different models influence the tourism provision in terms of both products and services. Authors highlight the understanding of disability under different models toward diverse tourism experiences. Several suggestions are offered on the complementary of the models and the implications on the transformation of the accessible tourism industry in the future. Cruces Portales (2015) uses a scenario planning approach to envisage alternative futures for accessible tourism. With a timeframe leading to 2050, four alternative futures are unravelled through storytelling. The scenarios are built on a matrix that includes the opposing forces of empathy \u2013 apathy, and fear of loss and certainty of benefits. The resulting, aptly named scenarios (Eden Gardens, Golden Bridge, Wasted Future and State of Hope) showcase different behaviours, schedules of changes and insights. Authors conclude with strategic ideas and proposals for the future of accessible tourism.\nConclusion When exploring the future of tourism in this area two opposing trends can be observed: future societies are predicted to become more similar, more homogenous as a consequence of consumerism, globalisation and converging urban lifestyles. However, the accessible tourism market is characteristically diverse, with complex needs and the range of dreams and ambitions is boundless. Will future global travellers be able to access more varied and personal services or will increasing numbers of travellers give rise to greater standardization of services? Accessible tourism as an emerging field of study will influence tourism destination competitiveness in the future, whether that be from a human rights, emerging market segment or service delivery perspective. In this conceptual examination, we have presented implications of number of theoretical constructs and lenses through which accessible tourism will be influenced in the future. In this special issue, a number of future dimensions are explored that demonstrate how the field has moved from an examination of the intersection of disability and tourism, to one that is clearly defined through conceptual and definitional approaches as accessible tourism. There is a common thread amongst all the papers presented in this special issue. They focus around stakeholder collaboration, as a foundation for the future development of accessible tourism. It has been explicitly suggested that raising awareness amongst stakeholders is essential to overcome barriers inhibiting the application of solutions that enhance access. The importance of stakeholder collaboration across the accessible tourism value chain has been emphasized in a number of ways in this special issue. Improving accessibility of facilities, transportation, attractions and destinations more generally, demands the collaboration of a wide range of stakeholders including architects, designers, economists, local councils, policy makers, travellers with disabilities, historians and archaeologists to name a few. Therefore \u201csocialising\u201d tourism means that access can be granted only when a number of relevant stakeholders are in accord, work together and specifically developed strategies to target the accessible tourism market. Stakeholder collaboration is a key factor for developing accessible tourism solutions, recognising the value of the market and capitalising on it. Hence, a collaborative approach is required to recognise the complementary nature of the different paradigms; to re-shape and transform the future of the accessible tourism through influencing the tourism industry, contributing government organisations and the not-for-profit sectors. The strength and depth of stakeholder collaborations will determine alternative future realities; from a future where all cooperate and share benefits for all parties, to a fatalistic picture where each stakeholder is sailing alone because they consider their interests incompatible, and everything in between. UD should provide a better accessible tourism future that should enhance the competitiveness of tourism destinations and organisations."}, {"title": "The Concepts of Design for All and Universal Design", "article": null}, {"title": "Finding a way towards high-quality, accessible tourism: the role of digital ecosystems", "article": "By drawing on the concept of digital ecosystems, this paper is amongst the first studies to suggest a path to making tourism locations more accessible to all tourists (with or without disabilities) based on technology.\nThis paper describes a path to fostering accessible tourism, drawing on local authorities, particularly municipalities and universities.

Tourism experience and tourism ecosystem from perspective of tourists with mobility disability 4.1 Mapping the tourism experience through the tourism customer journey The tourism customer journey (TCJ) involves mapping the entire journey of a tourist, outlining all the stages a person goes through when experiencing the need to move for tourism purposes (\u00c5str\u00f8m, 2020). The TCJ draws on the more general concept of the customer journey, which is the \u201cprocess a customer goes through, across all stages and touch points, that makes up the customer experience\u201d (Lemon and Verhoef, 2016, p. 71). Mapping customer journeys is a popular and effective way to grasp the entire tourism customer experience (Rosenbaum et al., 2017). If the tourism product as a whole was offered by one single company, the general customer journey concept could be easily applied to tourism in the same way as it is applied to other kinds of services (e.g. banking, retail and insurance services). However, as will be discussed shortly, tourism is a more complex service because of the number and variety of co-creating actors and the relationships amongst them. Here, we apply the TCJ to the context of people with mobility disability. A similar analysis could be applied to people with other disabilities (Al\u00e9n et al., 2012), resulting in different and specific types of TCJs. Given the complexity of applying a contextual study to all types of disabilities, this study focusses only on people with mobility disability, but the same method of analysis could be easily extended and replicated. From the very beginning of the TCJ, even when individuals are planning their holiday, they will encounter a series of actors, whose number will dramatically increase in the subsequent stages of the journey (Buhalis, 2000; Saraniemi and Kyl\u00e4nen, 2011). This is because tourism involves a complex ecosystem that has many actors who influence to a greater or lesser extent the experience perceived by individuals during their journey (Gretzel et al., 2016). The quality delivered by each actor clearly influences the overall quality of the tourist's overall experience (Ciasullo, 2017). Sometimes this phenomenon is emphasised because the quality performance of one provider has a spillover effect on the customer's evaluation of the quality performance of other components of (or actors in) the tourism ecosystem (Bourdeau et al., 2007). That is, a negative performance in one part of the journey may have a negative halo effect on the entire journey, considering that the tourist (beyond being the focal actor of the ecosystem) (Storbacka et al., 2016) is the only actor to see all the components of the ecosystem. Similarly, a positive performance in one of the moments of truth (Normann, 2001) has the potential to compensate for a series of negative performances in other parts of the journey. Overall, there is a remarkable risk of tourist dissatisfaction, which is heightened when the person undertaking the journey has some form of disabilities, such as when they have reduced mobility. These arguments can be illustrated through the construction of the TCJ for a holiday that is independently conceived and designed by a person with mobility disability who has time to spend in a destination to be selected and does not want to rely on standardised offerings delivered by tour operators. For this purpose, we draw on the general framework suggested by Baccarani and Cassia (2017), according to which a holiday is articulated and occurs in the following four main stages (Figure 1): destination choice and trip design; outbound trip; staying at the destination; transfer to another destination or return home. Each of the four stages of the TCJ develops through the processes that are outlined below. The points marked with the sign (*) in the following list represent critical aspects for people with mobility disability because they can entail various problems related to accessibility because of the presence of architectural, communication, cultural, technological and relational barriers. The first stage of the TCJ \u2013 destination choice and trip design \u2013 encompasses the formation of a tourist's experiential expectations drawing on the following elements: time available for the journey, motivations triggering the need for the journey, any previous personal holiday experiences, any previous indirect holiday experiences (e.g. information collected online, online reviews and e-word-of-mouth), dialogue and interactions with disability organisations and associations, information available online or printed specialised magazines and publications, information available in promotional materials delivered by tourism destinations, means of transportation available and reservation of such transportation (*), type of accommodations available and reservation of such lodgings (*), definition of a hierarchy of suitable destinations (*). The second stage of the TCJ \u2013 outbound trip \u2013 covers the most complex part of the holiday. In fact, the anticipated benefits of the planned holiday take shape during this stage. In the case that the tourist uses a personally owned means of transport suitable for their disability to reach the boarding point and that the travel is done by aeroplane, this stage includes the following elements: printing the boarding pass, estimating the time that they must leave home to reach the airport (this estimation is informed by customers' sensitivity to risk and the information available), preparing their luggage, planning which road or highways to take to reach the airport, stopping at rest areas to meet their needs or the needs of others or to comply with the requirements of the transport providers (*), parking in an area near the airport (*), checking in their luggage (*), reaching the boarding point (*), complying with any safety control procedures (*), waiting at a boarding gate (*), boarding the aeroplane (*), flying to the destination (*), disembarking and claiming their luggage (*), searching for a local means of transport to reach the accommodation facility (*), arriving and being welcomed at the accommodation facility (*). The third stage of the TCJ \u2013 staying at the destination \u2013 represents the core of the holiday with all that a person desired for their time away on holiday. This is a stage of personal enhancement in relation to seeking knowledge, values and relationships. During this stage, the core value of the holiday emerges and is influenced, at least in the beginning, by the travel experience, which may increase or diminish the initial enthusiasm. This stage encompasses the following points and involves a variety of actors at the destination: planning itineraries, visits and activities that the tourists wish to engage in at the destination based on their previous knowledge and the information available to them, visiting cultural, artistic and natural sites in an area (*), forming relationships with the host community (*), selecting from a variety of foods and eateries on offer (*), participating in local guided tours (e.g. wine tours) (*), using local means of transport (*), purchasing souvenirs. The fourth stage of the TCJ \u2013 transfer to another place or return back home \u2013 is similar to stages two and three described above, and includes the overall evaluation of the perceived quality in relation to the expected quality developed in stage one. In addition to the steps described above, which imply a variety of relationships between the tourist and several different actors, the context of a holiday is even more complex because tourist safety and care must be specifically assured, particularly for PwD. These conditions must be guaranteed by higher-level welfare systems, with which the tourism service network should be able to cooperate effectively. In summary, in this TCJ the tourist benefits from a variety of services that globally support the creation of the tourism experience, which is phenomenologically determined and perceived by the beneficiary (i.e. the tourist) (Vargo and Lusch, 2016). 4.2 Identifying the tourism ecosystem in relation to tourists with mobility disability This subsection identifies the actors that form the complex tourism ecosystem in its co-creation of the tourism experience. During each of the four stages of the TCJ, many different actors contribute to the formation of the overall tourist experience by delivering or not delivering the expected quality. In the tourist's experience, all these actors form a tourism service ecosystem, even if they represent only a set of services that the customer has assembled (Baccarani and Cassia, 2017). In fact, a service ecosystem implies a self-contained, self-adjusting system of resource-integrating actors connected by shared institutional arrangements and mutual value creation (Vargo and Lusch, 2016). However, this level of coordination amongst all the actors involved in the co-creation of tourism experience does not yet exist. Below, we outline the actors involved in each of the four stages of the TCJ. In the first stage, the tourist imagines, designs, plans and anticipates the pleasure of their holiday. To complete this stage, the tourist relies on the information provided by actors such as airlines and accommodation providers and interact with them directly or through intermediaries. For people with mobility disability, the dialogue and interactions with disability organisations and associations play an important role. As highlighted by the UNWTO, disabled peoples' organisations (DPOs) play a key role in accessible tourism because \u201cthey are mediators in understanding specific needs, existent barriers and the ways to bridge them\u201d (UNWTO, 2020). At this first stage of the TCJ (destination choice and trip design), quality is evaluated on the basis of the completeness and clarity of the information provided by multiple actors. All the actors involved in this first stage of the TCJ represent the holiday-design ecosystem (see Figure 3). In the second stage of the TCJ (outbound trip), at least the following 12 actors are involved, and this number could be even higher if a tourist decides to use public means of transport (instead of a personally owned means on transport): producers of publications or websites and intermediaries distributing information that guides the tourist in selecting the destination during the season in which the journey takes place; booking organisations through their websites; transport providers, including those preparing the service timetable; highways operators who have information about roadworks and any related delays; firms executing the roadworks who have information about any interruptions that may affect the roadworks and travel times; firms managing the rest areas and a variety of other services that may be required; firms managing the parking areas who may assist customers to reach their boarding point after having parked their vehicle; airport company that manages the departure airport that offers a welcome service and controls safety processes; airline that is responsible for checking in passengers, assigning boarding gates, flying times and delivering baggage; airport company that manages the arrival airport that offers welcome services and provides information to customers and about local means of transport; local transport service operators; accommodation services providers. Therefore, a tourist interacts with at least 12 different co-creating actors during the second stage of the TCJ. These actors are connected in the tourist's mind but they are practically linked only through market relations and they do not coordinate their decisions and behaviours. Thus, it is unlikely that the tourist will be able to complete the second stage without experiencing some level of difficulty. For example, the tourist may miss the flight because of planned roadwork not being properly notified in advance or because of other unforeseen events. To evaluate the quality of the overall experience, the tourist considers all the components of this stage of the TCJ, comparing expected and actual quality. In particular, the tourist will appreciate the problem-solving capability of the actors. This second group of actors represents the travel ecosystem (see Figure 3). In the third stage of the TCJ (staying at the destination), the tourist stays at the chosen destination where they interact with at least the following actors: firms who manage welcome and accommodation services; restaurateurs; local inhabitants (local community); local transport service operators; local merchants with their value propositions; agencies who organise local tours so that customers can explore local traditions, culture and products; municipalities; organisations protecting tourists' safety and care. This third stage of the TCJ has fewer actors than the second stage. However, the variety of actors is greater because during the tourist's stay at the destination, the tourist will engage in activities such as trying different types of food offerings to appreciate the local food culture, which means they will have contact and engage with more actors. Similarly, to explore local artistic, natural and cultural heritage, the tourist will select from a variety of opportunities that are available at the destination. In the third stage of the TCJ, the local community also plays a fundamental role in welcoming tourists and in co-creating their tourism experiences. In fact, in addition to the technical and functional\u2013relational components of the quality delivered by local services (Gr\u00f6nroos, 1990; Kang and James, 2004), the welcoming atmosphere experienced at the destination plays a central role in the formation of the overall perceived quality (Nunkoo and Ramkissoon, 2011). All the actors involved in the third stage of the TCJ represent the staying at destination ecosystem (see Figure 3). The fourth stage (transfer to another place or return back home) is a replication of the stages two and three outlined above and encompasses the tourist's comparison between the overall perceived quality and the expected quality developed in stage one. The actors that populate the tourism service ecosystem are largely the same for tourists with and without disabilities. However, tourists with disabilities can select amongst a smaller number of offerings than tourists without disabilities. Moreover, actors are required to have adequate technical and relational skills to deliver tourism services to tourists with disabilities. Thus, tourists with disabilities must face greater difficulties in their travel-related choices because of the presence of several types of barriers (see Figure 2). The tourism ecosystem described in this sub-section is depicted in Figure 3. The quality of the tourism experience emerges from the relationships established within this tourism ecosystem through which resources are combined and value is co-created. Such relationships have different degrees of smoothness depending on the presence of several barriers.\n5. Barriers to accessible tourism: can digital ecosystems represent a solution? Drawing on the arguments developed so far, this section identifies in detail the barriers to fulfilling tourism experience co-creation for PwD. The intention of the discussion is to understand whether and how digital ecosystems could represent a viable solution to such barriers. The identified relationships amongst the co-creating actors have not been harmonised to deliver the overall quality desired by the tourist because they are regulated by pure competitive mechanisms, emphasising the value of a specific part of the ecosystem instead of the value of the entire ecosystem. However, in tourism, competition amongst companies of the same sector can exist only once a territory as a whole is attractive. As highlighted in several studies (Baccarani et al., 2019; Barnes, 2004), the territory is not a physical space, but a highly complex viable subject emerging from all co-creations over time through the interactions between nature and human beings. Thus, the territory emerges from the relational synergies between the people who inhabit it and the environment. Therefore, the stronger the synergies established in a certain location, the higher the location's attractiveness and value, which then make the location a platform in which individual actors can compete against each other with their propositions. That is, the long-term attractiveness of a territory and of a tourism destination derives from the actions of the entire ecosystem, within which the actors must aim to do their best through a continuous dialogue with the territorial ecosystem. For this purpose, tourism must be conceived in a holistic manner by deploying planning efforts that involve all the actors of the ecosystem and engage all the potential beneficiaries of the tourism offering \u2013 be they are tourists with or without disabilities (Darcy et al., 2020). This perspective cannot ignore a series of barriers that determine biases in the co-creation of a location that provides tourism services for all tourists and particularly for those with mobility disability. In detail, the following barriers to accessible tourism can be identified (Gillovic et al., 2018; Michopoulou et al., 2020; Nyanjom et al., 2018): informational barriers; architectural barriers; political barriers; cultural barriers; relational barriers; technological barriers; entrepreneurial myopia. These barriers are outlined below from the perspective of PwD. Informational barriers refer to the difficulties that a person with disabilities faces when desiring to autonomously evaluate and choose a means of transport, accommodation, a holiday itinerary or simple holiday activities such as shopping. While there is usually a great deal of information is available for such services, informational needs of PwD leads to higher levels of complexity. For example, even when information about tourism services is available it can difficult to verify. Architectural barriers refer to the obstacles PwD encounter on holiday when engaging in activities such as accessing means of transport, moving in different locations, and using sidewalks and roads. Inconveniences related to architectural barriers can often also be experienced by people without disabilities (e.g. finding it difficult to understand the subway system) but the barriers are emphasised for PwD. Architectural barriers are directly connected to political barriers, which refer to the needs of PwD in the context of a political agenda. While political discourses highlight the ideal of acting to eliminate architectural barriers, political actions are often guided by urgency, short-termism and narrow-sighted electoral benefits. Cultural barriers refer to the indifference that can characterise the behaviour of all people of all abilities (Gillovic et al., 2018) towards PwD. This barrier is manifest in factors such as the lack of respect for PwD parking slots. Relational barriers refer to the general population viewing PwD from a self-righteous perspective, believing that the PwD cannot live a full life, even within the constraints of the experienced impairments. Technological barriers refer to the speed of the technological change related to means of transport and communication, which can create difficult situations for those who do not keep up with the ongoing changes. Entrepreneurial myopia refers to the inability to appreciate the size and value of the tourism market for PwD and of changes occurring in public opinion. This myopia is in tension with the ideals of sustainability provided by Agenda 2030 (United Nations, 2015), which explicitly highlights the need to promote sustainability and inclusivity and to empower PwD (e.g. points 11 and 23 of Agenda 2030) and by the Global Code of Ethics for Tourism (UNWTO, 2001), which states the \u201cright to tourism\u201d (article 7). When accessible tourism experiences are designed, it is important to avoid ad-hoc solutions aimed exclusively at PwD (Scheyvens and Biddulph, 2018). Following the principles of universal design (Michopoulou et al., 2020), tourism providers should in fact enable experiences that are useable by all people, with or without disabilities. This approach is consistent with the idea that tourism carries a value that makes it a public service, interpreted as a service that should be assured for every member of communities that desire such services. The question now arises of the assessment of the potential of digital ecosystems to remove the identified barriers and enable effective accessible tourism experience co-creation. While it is clear that technology cannot solve all the problems, we contend that it represents a valuable engine for such effective co-creation. As noted by Akaka and Vargo (2014), technology should be conceived as an operant resource able to bring about changes in ecosystems and influence value co-creation processes. The provision of a platform to support the engagement of actors involved in accessible tourism can thus represent a first step to first removing informational and relational barriers, and over time, smoothening other barriers (e.g. cultural barriers). Thus, technology can enable the emergence of a digital ecosystem with tourists and their needs as the focal actors (Gretzel et al., 2015, 2016). Such an ecosystem could initially organise and coordinate suitable solutions to emerging PwD needs and issues by collecting and sharing the information concerning all the actors of the ecosystem. Given that tourism is a service provided by a specific territory, the digital ecosystem should be led by the authorities in charge at the territorial level, whether a municipality, province, region or country. Given that the emerging ecosystems require rapid efficiency and effectiveness checks, it seems more appropriate that the process begins at the local territorial level and then extended (through imitation and adaptations) to higher levels. Beyond authorities in charge at the territorial level, universities and other research institutes should play a central role in the design of a tourism ecosystem. These institutions should establish a dialogue with tourists, with PwD and with disability organisations and associations, without overlooking local inhabitants who are important for creating a warm and smooth welcoming. The emergence of the tourism ecosystem also draws on the constructive contributions of all the organisations representing the service providers who play a role in co-creating tourism experiences. The digital ecosystem should also be based on a series of incentives for firms that decide to be a part of the ecosystem, beyond a process of certification and evaluation of their delivered quality. As a good starting point, municipalities could establish tourism departments that have the additional responsibility for the removal of mobility barriers. The viability of this choice is demonstrated by the experience of Verona, the first (and currently the only) municipality in Italy that has introduced such a department. For smaller municipalities, the digital ecosystem could be created at a higher level, such as in a consortium of municipalities, a province or a region. Figure 2 presents the main features of the tourism digital ecosystem. Overall, the establishment of a digital ecosystem aims to make the territory an inclusive, warm and welcoming location where people want to live or stay. Hence, by providing an engagement platform, technology can act as an operant resource, disrupting the myopia guiding each actor's individual behaviours. An example of a digital ecosystem to support accessible tourism is the one being implemented by Explora, the destination management organisation of the Lombardy region (Italy). Explora has begun to establish a digital ecosystem (Ecosistema Digitale Turistico della Lombardia) through a platform that aims to support information sharing amongst the actors of Lombardy's tourism ecosystem. This ecosystem has not been created specifically to support accessible tourism. However, through this platform, operators could coordinate and harmonise the design of accessible tourism experiences, which would then be communicated and sold through the related web portal \u201cin-lombardia.it\u201d. This web portal currently hosts dozens of accessible tourism experiences; however, these are not conceived following the concept of the holistic ecosystem described in this paper. Nonetheless, the technological infrastructure that has been created has the ability to foster the future emergence of such a holistic accessible tourism ecosystem."}, {"title": "Tourism Accessibility for Impaired", "article": "\u201cI have a wife and three children.

These are all different types of travelers who have different degrees of accessibility restrictions and mobility requirements.\nAnd a large proportion of travelers with disabilities have \"invisible\" impairments (such as cognitive or mental health conditions and long-term illnesses) that may not be, unlike wheelchair users, immediately obvious just by looking at them.\nWhen planning for and communicating about the accessibility features and services you provide, therefore, rather than simply using the \"handicap symbol\" (the ubiquitously used sign of a wheelchair user - the top-left pictogram on the above image), these various areas of accessibility needs must be considered and appropriately indicated.\nShare on your website and brochures, for example, if you provide assistive listening devices on your tour, or if sign language interpretation is available within any of the attractions you visit.\n\"Tourism for All\" is a concept that is addressing a growing segment of travelers with a diverse range of needs and requirements. What is \"accessible\" to one traveler who is a wheelchair user, for example, may be very difficult to access or completely inaccessible to another traveler with a different type of disability, mobility impairment or other conditions.\nThat's why becoming more inclusive is a more appropriate goal for the tourism industry than focusing just on \"accessible tourism\" (which can be vague and hard to define - accessible for whom?).\nAn inclusive tourism business or destination works to offer positive travel experiences to people with different needs by addressing them from various perspectives, and by providing design and service solutions that aim to cover as many different groups as possible.\nUniversal Design: Designing for Everyone, Being a Good Host\nWhen it comes to being inclusive and promoting Tourism for All, a key concept that underlies the solutions to be implement by tourism businesses and destinations is Universal Design.\nThe definition of Universal Design is as follows:\nUniversal Design is the design and composition of an environment so that it can be accessed, understood and used to the greatest extent possible by all people regardless of their age, size, ability or disability. An environment (or any building, product, or service in that environment) should be designed to meet the needs of all people who wish to use it. This is not a special requirement, for the benefit of only a minority of the population. It is a fundamental condition of good design. If an environment is accessible, usable, convenient and a pleasure to use, everyone benefits.\n- Centre for Excellence in Universal Design, \" What is Universal Design\nTo understand where you need to improve in order to offer universally accessible experience for everyone's benefit, take some time to reflect on the whole customer journey from the perspectives of guests with different access needs and mobility requirements.\nThink about how they experience travel - from the customer finding your business, to booking their trip, to arriving in your destination, to getting around during their stay.\nAre there steps to enter the restaurant that will make it difficult for customers with limited mobility? Does your hotel offer an accessible and easy-to-follow process for guests with disabilities to check in/out and get around within the property? And is your website designed for users with different needs (e.g. individuals with hearing or vision impairment)?\nBusinesses often have barriers that make it difficult for customers with particular access or mobility impairments to enjoy a certain product or service, because of the lack of awareness that those barriers exist.\nAnd in some cases, businesses may be \"rejecting\" prospective customers without ever knowing. The 2016 Click-Away Pound study found that \"71% of customers with access needs will click away from a website that they find difficult to use\".\nWith all the different types of accessibility requirements, it may seem difficult or impossible to anticipate and accommodate the various needs of your customers. But it's important to remember that in tourism we are in the business of providing services to welcome guests; and that it is in fact your responsibility as a host to cater to the needs of your guests and to make them feel welcome.\nIt's part of being a good host.\nBy considering the diverse needs and abilities of all throughout the design process, universal design creates products, services and environments that meet peoples' needs. Simply put, universal design is good design. - Centre for Excellence in Universal Design, \"What is Universal Design\"\nInclusive Growth and Sustainable Development\nWith the growing importance of the accessible tourism market, and especially the spending power of this market segment including the \"multiplier effect\" (each traveler with impairment is likely to influence the purchase decisions of multiple members of their party), there is a strong economic imperative to be considered. To remain competitive, your tourism business and destination should be investing in universal design and inclusive solutions.\nBeyond the economic imperative, however, there are also key reasons why inclustive tourism should be part of the global sustainable tourism agenda.\nWith an estimated 15% of the world population living with some forms of disabilities (World Health Organization, World Report on Disability 2011), and the changing demographic of the \"rapidly ageing\" populations around the world (WHO, Aging and Life Course), sustainable development can only be achieved through an inclusive approach to creating solutions and opportunities.\nThe United Nations' \"Disability and Development Report: Realizing the Sustainable Development Goals by, for and with persons with disabilities\" (2018) recognizes that \"striving to achieve disability-inclusive development is not only the right thing to do, it is also the practical thing to do,\" as \"the success of the 2030 Agenda requires a participatory and inclusive approach in which all stakeholders, including persons with disabilities, are engaged.\"\nAnd that's why Tourism for All is highlighted in the Global Sustainable Tourism Criteria, the baseline standard for sustainability in travel and tourism.\nSource: Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC)\nAnd in the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO)'s Global Code of Ethics for Tourism.\nSource: UNWTO, Global Code of Ethics for Tourism\nInclusion in the Work Place\nHaving understood the importance of striving for universal design and working towards becoming more inclusive, what can tourism businesses do to get started? What are some of the first steps?\nOne of the key challenges when considering steps to becoming more inclusive is to understand the diverse needs of your customers and your prospective customers. The barriers that prevent some people from having a positive travel experience - whether they may be steps that cannot be climbed, signs that cannot be read, or buttons that cannot be reached - are hard to notice unless you put yourself in the position of those with particular disabilities and impairments.\nOne of the most effective ways for businesses to understand the various accessibility needs of their customers is to have team members who know and represent the perspectives of those customers. In short, hire people with disabilities. Empower them to help make your business more inclusive, both within your operations and through your products and services.\nThe UNWTO report \"Recommendations on Accessible Tourism\" (2013) states that \"the staff of tourism establishments and related services should be prepared to know, understand and address the needs of customers with disabilities\", and \"the staff should include employees who know how to communicate with persons with sensory disabilities.\"\n\"The hospitality industry serves travellers from all over the world. The diversity of cultures implies a diversity of customer expectations as well. The hotels with a diverse workforce to cater to such a wide customer base hold a strong competitive advantage over others. ... [To] have employees that understand the needs and requirements of the customers and provide key insights into making properties progressively accessible is also a crucial element of the overall business strategy.\" - Hospitality Workers Training Centre, \"Disability Inclusion in the Hospitality Industry Makes Business Sense\"\nBusiness Examples: Staff Diversity and Inclusion\nLemon Tree Hotels Limited, India\nWinner of the 2019 Tourism for Tomorrow Awards, in the category \"Investing in People\", Lemon Tree Hotels have focused on creating a socially inclusive work environment, bringing together people of different backgrounds, abilities and ethnicities to work as a unified team with a common goal. Lemon Tree supports \"opportunity deprived\" workers, including those with physical, social or economic disabilities, by creating and offering opportunities to realize their full potential and live with dignity.\nIlunion Hotels, Spain\nFifty percent of ILUNION Hotels' employees have disabilities. The hotel is committed to integrating its approach to universal accessibility not just in its services for customers with disabilities, but also throughout its business model, including its employees and suppliers. Illunion Hotels received the 2016 UNWTO Ethics Award for its work in the area of accessible tourism for all and its contribution to change attitudes, break down social barriers and make the accommodation industry more inclusive.\nEinsmehr Hotel\nPhoto: hoteleinsmehr\nLocated in Augsburg, Germany, Einsmehr Hotel is an inclusive hotel with about half of its workforce consisting of people with disabilities. The hotel works with a local association \"einsmehr\" (\"one more\"), which supports people with the Down Syndrome in the surrounding area, seeking to create jobs and a labor market for people with (mental) disabilities.\nSV Tenacious\nSource: Martin Heng\nOperated by the UK-based Jubilee Sailing Trust (JST), SV Tenacious is the largest wooden tall ship, and the only one of its kind designed and built to be fully accessible for people with disabilities or impairments (including wheelchair users).\nMartin Heng, who joined Tenacious\u2019 voyage from Sydney to Melbourne in 2018, describes his experience in this Lonely Planet blog:\n\"There are no passengers on JST voyages, only crew \u2013 made up of nine permanent crew members and 30 to 40 voyage crew \u2013 and everyone is expected to fulfil their duties to the best of their ability, whatever that ability is. Experiencing a voyage on Tenacious (or her sister ship Lord Nelson) is an object lesson in the benefits of inclusion and accessibility. People living with a disability can challenge themselves, experience adventure and explore what they are capable of given the opportunity, while able-bodied crew members are shown that disability doesn\u2019t necessarily mean incapacity.\" - Martin Heng, \"Setting sail for accessible adventure on the SV Tenacious\" (Lonely Planet)\nThis amazing example of SV Tenacious is a good reason for all of us in the tourism industry to be asking, as Martin challenges us, \"If they can do this, what excuse do we have not to make mainstream tourism operations more accessible?\"\nSo a better question here, instead of \u201cHow can tourism become more inclusive?\u201d, may be, \u201cwhat are we not (yet) doing to make tourism more inclusive, and how are we going to push for change?\""}, {"title": "The 10 best accessible hotels in Copenhagen, Denmark", "article": "Carol Ireland\nI didn\u2019t expect the hotel to be anything special as i had booked a small room for 2 nights, but when I stepped into the lift i was transported to another level and i was gob smacked with all the attention to detail in all aspects.

He was looking forward to a hot shower and a cold beverage before getting some shut-eye. Unfortunately, the shower part of these simple plans turned out to be impossible.\nYee, a Marriott Bonvoy Platinum member, is battling a brain tumor and uses a wheelchair. Months before this trip, he had reserved a room with a roll-in shower. Yee had even called the property days before his arrival to reconfirm this basic necessity.\nIn the end, none of those efforts made a difference \u2014 the hotel assigned him a room where he couldn't bathe.\nWith no roll-in shower rooms available at the hotel, Yee's plans for the night took an unpleasant turn. He had no choice but to go to bed without washing up after his full day of travel.\nMARRIOTT CINCINNATI AIRPORT/FACEBOOK\nHowever, for Yee, the lack of a usable shower in his room wasn't the worst part of the experience; no, it was the insensitivity to his plight.\nSince he wasn't given the room Marriott had confirmed, he complained and applied for the Ultimate Reservation Guarantee compensation. For his troubles, as a Platinum member, he expected to be eligible for the $200 and 90,000 points outlined in the Ultimate Reservation Guarantee terms.\nA customer service representative, however, inexplicably told Yee that Marriott considers a roll-in shower as an on-request amenity, not a guaranteed feature. As a result, Yee's request for Marriott's Ultimate Reservation Guarantee compensation was summarily rejected.\nUnable to believe that Marriott could really view an accessible shower as a negotiable amenity, especially after the lengths he had gone to when booking a specific room type, Yee reached out to TPG for help. He hoped we could shine a light on his situation and recommend hotel brands that honor confirmed reservations for guests with limited mobility.\nAs it turns out, that same week, another TPG reader sent a similar tale to tips@thepointsguy.com about her experience at a Hyatt hotel. It's one that, unfortunately, suggests this insensitivity to guests with specific needs might just be a widespread issue in the hotel industry.\nDaily Newsletter Reward your inbox with the TPG Daily newsletter Join over 700,000 readers for breaking news, in-depth guides and exclusive deals from TPG\u2019s experts Email address Sign up By signing up, you will receive newsletters and promotional content and agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge the data practices in our Privacy Policy .

The Americans with Disabilities Act mandates lodging facilities constructed after 1993 must comply with the regulation.\nOlder hotels may not have modern-day accessibility elements. The good news is that many hotels have voluntarily complied with the ADA even if the property isn't required to do so. However, it doesn't mean that hotels, even newly built ones, have tons of ADA-compliant accommodations or those with accessibility features they rely on, so travelers with specific needs face hurdles with every single stay.\nThe issue goes beyond Marriott\nDr. Jayne Fortson was a 19-year-old student at Albany State University when an ill-advised adventure with friends altered her life forever. While exploring Thatcher State Park in Upstate New York, the group entered a cave that collapsed on them. A gravely injured Fortson was trapped under a pile of rubble inside the cave for nearly 24 hours.\nRescuers were finally able to extract her, but the damage to her body was permanent. Since that time, nearly 50 years ago, Fortson has been paralyzed from the waist down.\nStill, she never let this tragic accident interfere with her life plans. Just weeks later, she returned to Albany State University to continue her studies. Fortson developed a new goal: to ensure that students with mobility challenges could freely navigate campus.\nFortson graduated on time, went on to medical school and, in her free time, became an accomplished Paralympian. She married, raised a family and is a world traveler.\nThere's almost nothing Fortson hasn't been able to do despite the twist her fate took that night all those years ago.\nSo, imagine her surprise when she recently hit a hurdle she couldn't navigate at an unassuming Hyatt House in Morristown, New Jersey.\nNo way to shower at this Hyatt hotel\nHyatt House in Morristown, New Jersey. HYATT\nAfter traveling all day from Alaska to the East Coast to attend a family wedding, Fortson arrived at the front desk of the Hyatt House. Although she had alerted the staff that she uses a wheelchair and requires a fully accessible room with a roll-in shower, she was given a standard room.\nWhen she brought this issue up to the staff, they informed her that the property only has two accessible rooms with roll-in showers, and both were already occupied.\nThings went from bad to worse when she entered her assigned room. Not only did it not have a roll-in shower, but it had a raised bed, which made it much more difficult for her to transfer herself from the bed to her wheelchair and vice versa.\nFor the next two days, Fortson and her two daughters tried to make do.\n\"It was terrible, and of course, we couldn't leave since we were there for a wedding. We were with a large family group,\" Fortson told TPG. \"The only way I could get into bed was with the help of my daughters and the strength of my arms.\"\n\"But a raised bed like that would be impossible for a wheelchair-dependent guest to use without assistance,\" she continued. \"And since the bathroom had no roll-in shower, I could not bathe during my stay. It was demoralizing.\"\nDespite complaining to the front desk and reminding management that she had confirmed a specific type of room to accommodate her needs, the hotel had no other rooms to offer her and told her nothing could be done.\n\"In all my years of traveling, I have never experienced such a terrible situation at a hotel,\" Fortson told me during a phone call from her home in Alaska. \"I always try to stay at a Marriott because that brand is consistently attuned to the needs of their guests. If something goes wrong, they make it right.\"\nFortson went on to relate her experiences at various Marriott hotels in which the staff went above and beyond to ensure she could easily access all areas of her room. She told me that, in her opinion, Marriott is the gold standard for mobility-challenged guests.\nThis made Yee's Marriott complaint, which was sitting there on my desk as I chatted with Fortson, rather ironic.\nMarriott customer service: A roll-in shower is a request not guaranteed\nWhen I went through the paper trail Yee included in his emails, I shared his view that the Marriott customer service representative he had been dealing with needed some sensitivity training.\nHere was the initial email response Yee received from Marriott customer service after his stay:\n\"I reviewed the Confirmation email that you sent in. It states the Guaranteed Request: Mobility Accessible Room with Roll-In Shower.\nPer Marriott terms and conditions, under Section 4.3.c.vii. Guaranteed Room Type may have applied in this situation.\nAs a Platinum Elite member, you are entitled to this benefit compensation. However, the only room type that was guaranteed was the King bed. The Roll In shower was a request, not a guarantee.\nIn order to guarantee this room type as required, it is best to contact our Customer Care agents when booking so that we may coordinate with the proper team to ensure the room type is available at the hotel for your stay and to make sure that it is specifically set aside for you.\nYou have been given 10,000 bonus points for the situation. You can see these points on the Activity section of your account.\nEmmett, thank you for choosing Marriott for your travel needs. We look forward to assisting you with new adventures and travel memories in the future.\nHappy and safe travels.\n*******\nMarriott Bonvoy\u2122 Case Resolutions Specialist\"\nThis \"Case Resolutions Specialist\" seemed to be ignoring what Yee had already explained to them: He had called the hotel several times before arrival to remind the property of his needs.\nAlso, their closing signature, which most certainly came from a template, was more than a little tone-deaf.\nYee certainly did not need the assistance of Marriott in the future to create the type of travel memories it had created during this \"adventure.\"\nAsking Marriott if an accessible shower is really on-request only\nNot willing to give up, Yee continued to correspond with this Marriott \"specialist,\" who remained unswayed. So, Yee turned to TPG for help.\nAfter speaking with Yee and reviewing his documents, I was confident that Marriott would want to make some sort of amends for this situation \u2013 including addressing the specialist's repeated declaration that a roll-in shower is a request-only feature, like extra pillows, a bucket of ice or a specific view.\nI reached out to our executive contact at Marriott. This is not a customer service-facing person. This is someone I can contact as a consumer advocate and member of the media.\nAs I wrote:\n\"Emmett is very disappointed with what happened at the hotel, but he is even more disappointed by Marriott's response. [******] response makes it appear as if he complained about something trivial -- not that he had no way to have the basic necessity of showering.\n[*******] also told him that the Marriott Ultimate Reservation Guarantee doesn't apply to requests for accessible rooms.\nThis response seems insensitive to the feelings and needs of a person suffering with a brain tumor and who is trying to continue to live his life and travel for as long as possible.\nCould your team please have a look at this case and see if he actually does qualify for the Platinum Reservation Guarantee compensation?\nThanks! Michelle Couch-Friedman, Consumer Advocate\"\nIt wasn't long before I received a response.\nThe good (and common-sense) news from Marriott\nMARRIOTT CINCINNATI AIRPORT/FACEBOOK\nVery quickly, Yee received the good news from Marriott. Of course, an accessible shower is not an on-request amenity. It's a requirement for a traveler in a wheelchair.\nThe Marriott executive office contacted Yee to offer an apology and compensation that went beyond the Marriott Reservation Guarantee terms.\nAs in another Marriott case I recently wrote about, the individual property provided the generous resolution. (Note: Many Marriott properties are independently owned, franchised hotels. As a result, sometimes Marriott corporate's intervention can only accomplish so much.)\nYee wrote to tell me the good news:\n\"Hi Michelle, I just got off the phone. **** (name redacted for privacy) said the [Marriott property] offered 80,000 points, refunded our stay charge, plus $500 to cover what should have been a roll-in shower room somewhere that night.\nI told her that's more than what the Ultimate Reservation Guarantee states. She knew, and said the hotel wanted to make up for all the troubles. Also, she put me on a list related to internal ADA training programs they are working on.\nI don't think any of what's occurred in the past few days could have happened without your intervention. THANK YOU VERY MUCH! Emmett Yee\"\nWith Yee's problem successfully addressed, I turned my sights to the Hyatt House to find out what had happened with Fortson's reservation.\nWhat about that Hyatt House?\nHyatt House Boston/Burlington's ADA bathroom. AIMBRIDGE HOSPITALITY/HYATT\nI wish I could say that things went similarly well for Dr. Fortson, but they didn't.\nI sent multiple requests to the executive team at Hyatt over the course of several weeks but did not receive a response concerning Fortson's experience. For its part, this Hyatt House, which is an independently owned and franchised property, did issue Fortson Hyatt points as a goodwill gesture after her stay.\nIn response to an email from Fortson's sister, who was hosting the wedding, the property's manager wrote at the time:\n\"Thank you for bringing this important issue to our attention. I apologize that your sister's experience with our front desk team, and in her suite, was not a positive one and that we were unable to provide the room type that she had initially booked. While we did our best to make up for this on the day by providing her a shower chair so that she could use the shower in her suite, I understand that it was not an ideal solution. As a token of apology, I would like to provide her with 24,000 World of Hyatt points to her account. Enough for [two] free nights at a similar category hotel.\n(Hyatt House Morristown, spokesperson)\"\nFortson wasn't after compensation, though. As was the case when she first became a paraplegic as a college sophomore and immediately set out to be an advocate for others in the same situation, Fortson's goal in contacting TPG was to share her experience so that others might learn from it and be able to avoid the same. After this trip, she'll be sticking with Marriott, she says.\nWhile investigating this story, I learned that Avion Hospitality took over the management of this Hyatt House franchise in March 2023, well after Fortson's incident occurred. I was able to reach a spokesperson for the company, who told me that they intend to use this situation as a training opportunity for the staff on how to handle these situations better in the future \"with a refocus on ADA procedures.\"\n(Editor's note: Several days after publication, a public relations representative from Hyatt reached out with the following comment from Hyatt House Morristown general manager, Michael Barrett, who said, \"We sincerely apologize for this guest's experience. When we have not fully lived up to our purpose to care for people so they can be their best \u2013 like in this case \u2013 we hold ourselves accountable to do better. We addressed this situation with our team in an effort to prevent similar situations in the future.\")\nHowever, those two ADA-compliant rooms with roll-in showers remain permanently occupied, so it's unclear what plan of action the hotel will be able to take.\nHow to avoid ending up in an inaccessible room\nUnfortunately, I know from my case files that the experiences of these two TPG readers aren't unique. Due to poorly trained staff, sloppiness in the hotels' reservation systems, or franchise property owners who are unaware of the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act, travelers with mobility challenges can easily end up in inaccessible rooms.\nHere are some tips to reduce the chances of getting assigned a hotel room that can't meet your basic needs.\nConfirm that the hotel has accessible rooms\nThe first step to finding out if a property can fit your needs is to determine if the structure was built after 1993. If it wasn't, contact the hotel and ask if they've refurbished to comply with the ADA. Even if your hotel was built after the ADA was passed, you should probably still get in touch directly to learn about the accommodation options and property features.\nBased on ADA regulations, there may be only one or two rooms at the property that meet your needs. Travelers who need mobility assistance should be especially cautious of smaller properties (fewer than 50 rooms) as these aren't required to have any accessible rooms with roll-in showers.\nEven if you do ascertain that a hotel has rooms with the features you need, you'll need to dig deeper to determine if you can stay there comfortably.\nFind out precisely what an accessible room means at the hotel\nThere isn't a national definition of what an accessible room means in the United States, leaving it up to the traveler to confirm if the hotel will meet their needs.\nSome hotels will satisfy the requirement for a specific number of accessible rooms by creating accommodations that may or may not make things accessible to your situation. For instance, if you need a roll-in shower, booking an accessible room is not enough to be sure you'll get what you require.\nIt's critical that you find out from the hotel what types of rooms they have and what specific amenities each offers. Don't forget to ask about the public areas of the property. You can't assume that an accessible room means the same thing across the travel industry. It doesn't.\nAsk the hotel about your room \u2014 and get it in writing\nIn Yee's case, he had the roll-in shower confirmed in writing from Marriott. However, in Fortson's case, the hotel staff told her things they never noted in her reservation. In both cases, the rooms they were assigned lacked what they needed.\nBefore you book any hotel, make certain that the room you're booking can accommodate you. When you discuss your needs with the hotel, note the name of the person you're speaking with and let them know you're taking notes.\nUnfortunately, phone representatives sometimes say things that might not be accurate, and after you disconnect from that person, you have no record of what was said. So, take your notes and ask for a summary of your conversation to be sent to you via email. Most reputable companies will comply with this request.\nReconfirm via email and phone several days before your stay\nCall the hotel and remind the staff you'll soon be arriving and what your specific requirements are. Most hotels start blocking off and assigning rooms several days before a traveler's arrival date. It's crucial that before their scheduling team gets to work, you give them that reminder.\nFrequently reminding the property of your impending arrival and needs isn't you being a nuisance \u2013 it's you making sure that you receive what you require.\nBottom line\nI'm happy we could help Yee in this situation. I am surprised that Hyatt refused to comment on Fortson's experience, though the property did attempt to make a goodwill gesture in the form of points. Readers with specific mobility needs may wish to consider those responses in their future travel plans.\nRemember, if you find yourself in a battle with an airline, cruise line, car rental agency, vacation rental company or credit card, send your request for help to tips@thepointsguy.com, and I will be super happy to help you, too."}, {"title": null, "article": null}, {"title": "TSA Cares: What to expect when traveling with a mobility aid", "article": "Are you or someone you know traveling using a wheelchair or mobility aid?

It is about enabling everyone to enjoy the freedom that air travel offers. Approximately one in five people in the United States, or 64 million, have a disability and more than 10% of the population in the EU suffer from reduced mobility \u2013 mainly the disabled and the elderly.\nThe world\u2019s population is aging as virtually every country in the world is experiencing growth in the number and proportion of older persons in their population. As a result, IATA and its member airlines are committed to ensuring that all passengers can enjoy the freedom offered by air travel, no matter their abilities or limitations. This is not only the right thing to do for our passengers, it is also good for business. Passengers with disabilities will represent a growing segment. For instance, the total number of wheelchair requests in 2017 was approximately 15 million, a 30% increase on 2016.\nWhy is providing better access to individuals with disabilities important for the air transport industry?\nSafe and dignified travel for all passengers, including those with disabilities, is an airline commitment in addition, for the air transport industry it's not just because it is \"the right thing to do\" it also makes business sense.\nIATA member airlines have an inherent motivation to ensure that all people with accessibility needs have a positive experience when traveling by air. These people are customers-and are a growing segment of the population. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that more than one billion people live with some form of disability, which constitutes approximately 15% of the world's population.\nAirlines commit to improve travel for passengers with disabilities\nTherefore in 2019, the IATA Annual General Meeting (AGM) unanimously adopted a landmark industry resolution which re-affirmed the commitment of IATA member airlines to provide safe, reliable and dignified travel for people with disabilities. At the center of IATA's developement of its guiding principles and all its work on accessibility since, is the disability community's own guiding principle of \"Nothing For Us, Without Us.\" At every stage of the development of airline accessibility policy and operating standards, the disability community is involved and listened to. This is of course the only way to keep the focus on disability, accessibility and inclusion-particularly when facing a new reality and new measures due to a pandemic.\nChanging the focus from disability to accessibility and inclusion is allowing the travel sector to bring together passengers with disabilities and governments. Harmonizing regulations and processes and providing the clarity and global consistency that passengers expect.\nInterview with Linda Ristagno, IATA's AD External Affairs on Air Transport Accessibility\nAirlines launch global action group to improve handling of disability mobility aids\nIn July 2021, IATA announced the launch of a global Mobility Aids Action Group to examine and improve the transport journey of mobility aids, including wheelchairs, with the objective of improving the handling of this vital equipment for travelers with disabilities.\nThe Action Group is the first of its kind aimed at tackling issues around the safe and secure transport of mobility aids\u2014an issue of huge importance to a growing number of travelers. It also provides advice and recommendations to airlines and other stakeholders concerning the establishment of policy, process and standards related to the handling and transport of mobility aids.\nUniquely, the Mobility Aids Action Group involves the full range of stakeholders impacted by this issue, including accessibility organizations (representing travelers with disabilities), airlines, ground service providers, airports and mobility aids manufacturers. It is the first time a mobility aids manufacturer will be invited to participate in an IATA task force. \u201cAs airlines are just one link in the chain in the handling of mobility aids, it is essential we bring all players together to develop solutions. What\u2019s more, we are excited to invite a mobility aids manufacturer to the table. We think this is critical so all stakeholders can work together to take steps to improve the transport journey of mobility aids,\u201d said Willie Walsh, Director General of IATA.\nWheelchair damage or loss during air transportation\nWhile the industry has had standards for persons traveling with disabilities for some time there are still gaps. Damage to mobility aids has been an area that has been identified as a key topic to address from the disability community.\nAirlines have made efforts to improve, but damage or loss is still occurring. And when it does, it is highly distressing to the passenger as these devices are more than equipment\u2014they are extensions of their body and essential to their independence.\nTravelers with mobility aids face risks to their health and safety if their wheelchair or mobility equipment is lost, damaged or destroyed, as replacements are not always provided, and if provided, are not always suitable for the person\u2019s needs.\nThe loss or damage of wheelchairs or other mobility equipment takes away the independence of the traveler and affects every aspect of their daily lives until the matter is resolved appropriately.\nA recent survey from Able Move identified that among those who actively continue to fly, 55% say the biggest single cause of concern when flying was the fear of their wheelchair being damaged or lost.\n\u201cEvery year, thousands of wheelchairs are transported safely by air. However, damage or loss is still occurring. And when it does, it is devastating to the passenger as these devices are more than equipment\u2014they are extensions of their body and essential to their independence. We acknowledge that we are not where we want to be on this as an industry. This is why we want to do something about it on a global level, not through setting up a talking shop, but by bringing the key groups together to take practical action,\u201d said Willie Walsh, Director General of IATA.\nImproved access for passengers with disabilities in the industry restart\nAs airlines rebuild, the industry is eager to build a more inclusive restart. Despite the COVID-19 crisis, the IATA and its member airlines have worked with the accessibility community to move the priority of accessible air travel forward through a number of efforts. These are includeded in the latest Airport Handling Manual (AHM).\nWhat to consider for passengers' with disabilities air travel journey\nTo the extent possible, airline and other stakeholders should strive to ensure that passengers with disabilities maintain their independence and dignity. This is accomplished through adequate airport infrastructure, appropriate training, timely and customer-oriented services, as well as making use of technological solutions that can be leveraged to provided passengers with disabilities with choice and freedom to travel on their own terms. You can find detailed guidelines which can help your operations in section 176 of the AHM.\nPre-Travel: Passenger information, booking and ticketing\nCommunicating assistance needs in advance of travel is recommended and, in some cases, required to fulfill specialized requests. This allows airlines, airports and third-party service providers to be better prepared to assist passengers with disabilities throughout their travel itinerary, making the journey easier and the travel experience more seamless and enjoyable.\nAt the airport\nThe sole responsibility to provide assistance to passengers with disabilities throughout the airport is not limited to the airlines; depending on national regulations, airports may be responsible for providing assistance to passengers with disabilities directly, or via third-party service providers.\nAs not all passenger processes at an airport fall under the airlines\u2019 responsibility (i.e. security screening, exit immigration, customs, etc.) airlines need to work collaboratively with airports, regulators and other stakeholders in order to provide a safe and satisfying travel experience to all passengers.\nCheck-in\nAll available check-in methods such as via airline websites, mobile apps, self-service kiosks should be accessible to passengers with disabilities. In addition, airline agents involved in the check-in process should be trained to ensure that adequate assistance is provided. Passengers with disabilities should also always be offered assistance with carry-on and checked baggage.\nMobility device handling\nThe safe transport of a passenger\u2019s with disability personal mobility device is a critical operation for any airline as the wheelchair or scooter is an extension of the passenger and should be treated as such. Other mobility aids such as walkers and canes provide passengers struggling with mobility much-needed stability and support to safely walk and should also be handled with great care. As general guidance, the transportation of passenger battery-powered devices must be compliant with DGR subsection 2.3.\nBoarding and disembarking\nBoarding the aircraft can be a stressful experience for passengers with disabilities. Airlines should ensure that any requests made in advance are properly noted and any last-minute requests are handled efficiently and with care. Assistance must be provided as necessary, in addition airlines and airports should coordinate to make available at all stations wheelchairs and other mobility devices for boarding/disembarking within airport facilities, before departure, during intermediate stops and on arrival. Upon arrival, airlines should make best efforts to accommodate the passengers with disabilities, procedures will vary by terminal and gate configuration in terms of boarding bridge, etc. Therefore, all staff should be properly trained to provide: adequate mobility transfer techniques and prompt delivery of mobility devices. More details can be found in the Airport Handling Manual (AHM).\nWhat are the benefits of following the IATA guidance found in the AHM?\nPutting into practice the IATA guidance, airlines, airports and other industry stakeholders will:\nEfficiently serve passengers with disabilities by using IATA standards and best practices\nEfficiently communicate with passengers with disabilities before and during their travel experience\nEnsure available measures are applied consistently\nIdentify good practices in passenger assistance during disruptions and irregular operations\nHow can I get the Airport Handling Manual (AHM)?\nYou can order the latest edition of the AHM here."}, {"title": null, "article": null}, {"title": "New guidance for handling mobility aids", "article": "IATA announced new guidance to assist airlines and handling agents to transport mobility aids safely and efficiently and improve the travel experience for passengers with disabilities.\nProviding safe, reliable, and dignified transport for passengers with disabilities is a priority for airlines that was reinforced by a unanimously approved Resolution at the 75th IATA Annual General Meeting in 2019. The safe and efficient transport of mobility aids was identified as a key area for improvement by airlines, working with industry stakeholders and disability groups.\n\u201cAirlines are committed to ensuring passengers with disabilities can travel with dignity, confidence, and comfort. Working with representatives from the disability community, we established that new protocols to improve the transport of mobility aids were urgently required. This new guidance, created in partnership with key players in the travel chain, will improve service, and significantly reduce damage to these vital devices that are often an extension to the body of a passenger with a disability,\u201d said Nick Careen, IATA\u2019s Senior Vice President for Operations, Safety and Security.\nKey elements of the new guidance include:\nBetter processes for booking and information exchange, including the use of Special Service Request (SSR) and Passenger Name Requirement (PNR) codes to give advance information on the specifications of mobility aids.\nA recommendation to create an electronic mobility aid tag, fixed to the mobility aid and containing technical information which will help airlines and ground handlers transport the aid safely.\nAdvice to airlines on developing a communications toolkit for engaging with passengers with disabilities, including a clearly signposted and accessible website area.\nBest practices for loading, collection and return of mobility aids.\nA recommendation for dedicated specialized ramp personnel to be trained and deployed to handle mobility aids.\nGuidance for how to properly resolve instances where mobility aids are damaged.\nRevised and enhanced training of ground handlers and airline staff.\n\u201cExperience shows that communication is key to improving the handling of mobility aids. This guidance sets out steps for passengers, airlines, and the travel chain to exchange information at every stage of the travel journey. It will help airlines perform better and give passengers using mobility aids greater confidence. We\u2019ll be working with our members and stakeholders to operationalize this guidance, and the industry will be reaching out to policymakers to encourage harmonization with national regulations,\u201d said Careen.\nThe guidance reflects and builds on industry best practices and will continue to be revised and expanded prior to developing into industry standards. Other aspects include recommendations for airport designs to meet accessibility standards, as well as specific guidance to ensure compliance with the Dangerous Goods Regulations (for lithium-battery powered devices), in addition to step-by-step instructions on safely and securely loading mobility aids on board.\nAccess IATA Guidance on the Transport of Mobility Aids\nCredit | iStock"}]
