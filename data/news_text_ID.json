These recommendations aim to guide the decision-makers of natural resources in tourism in undertaking accessibility improvements. The document has a particular focus on facilitating access to protected areas, beaches and parks. The WCPA Tourism and Protected Areas Specialist Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT), acted as the expert reviewers. Their involvement was key in identifying the best actions geared towards a greater extent of accessibility and inclusiveness within nature areas, vis a vis tourism. The guidance tool, whose drafting was led by UNWTO, the ONCE Foundation and UNE, is part of the promotion of ISO Standard 21902:2021. Download here the guidelines in English and Spanish.\nRecommendations for cultural tourism key players on accessibility UNWTO, Fundaci\u00f3n ONCE and UNE issued in September 2023, a set of guidelines targeting key players of the cultural tourism ecosystem, who wish to make their offerings more accessible.\nThe key partners in the drafting and expert review process were the ICOMOS International Cultural Tourism Committee and the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT). The ICOMOS experts\u2019 input was key in covering crucial action areas where accessibility needs to be put in the spotlight, in order to make cultural experiences more inclusive for all people.\nThis guidance tool is also framed within the promotion of the ISO Standard ISO 21902, in whose development UNWTO had one of the leading roles. Download here the English and Spanish version of the Recommendations.\nNew user-friendly guides for destinations to implement accessibility standards On the occasion of the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, UNWTO, ONCE Foundation and the Spanish Association for Standardization have launched, in December 2022, a user-guide targeting public administrations and tourism destinations to implement ISO Standard 21902:2021. This is a key tool to understand specific actions that can be undertaken by a wide range of organizations entrusted with designing policies, strategies and destination marketing plans in the sphere of accessible tourism.

Just as other guidelines on the UNWTO series, this document will be revised in 2021 with relevant accessibility partners.\nReopening Tourism for Travellers with Disabilities:\nHow to Provide Safety Without Imposing Unnecessary Obstacles In partnership with the ONCE Foundation of Spain and the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT), UNWTO suggested in July 2020 a set of practical steps to ensure accessibility for all, under the new circumstances. \u201cReopening Tourism for Travellers with Disabilities\u201d provides recommendations for destinations and service providers to accommodate customers with disabilities and specific access requirements, including seniors.\nAccessible Tourism Destination The \"Accessible Tourism Destination\" was launched in 2019 by UNWTO and the ONCE Foundation, to recognize and promote accessible tourism destinations. The ATD is an annual UNWTO distinction based on an Expert Committee evaluation, which acknowledges destinations enabling a seamless experience to any tourist, regardless of their abilities. The first ATD was awarded in 2019 and has been temporarily put on hold, given the pandemic.\nVideo \"Change your destination\" The video \u201cChange your destination\u201d was issued by Fundaci\u00f3n ONCE and UNWTO by the occasion of the 2019 International Fair of Tourism (FITUR). Facilitating travel for people with disabilities is an exceptional business opportunity. Yet, a change in mind-set and in the model of tourism services provision is needed in order to meet this major market demand. Accessible environments and services contribute to improve the quality of the tourism product and can create more job opportunities for people with disabilities. Accessibility, therefore, must be an intrinsic part of any responsible and sustainable tourism policy and strategy.\nWorld Tourism Day 2016: \"Tourism for All - promoting universal accessibility\" To mark the celebration of the World Tourism Day 2016 under the theme \"Tourism for All - promoting universal accessibility\" UNWTO, the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT) and the Spanish ONCE Foundation for the Social Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities have produced a compilation of Good Practices in the Accessible Tourism Supply Chain. While these examples provide a small sample of possible solutions regarding accessibility, they will hopefully inspire others to take steps towards broadening the availability of accessible offers in tourism destinations around the world.

Ensuring that the information is accessible, is without any doubt a key to communicating successfully with visitors in all stages of their journey, particularly with regards to travelers with disabilities and special needs. The UNWTO Recommendations on Accessible Information in Tourism have been developed with the support and collaboration of the ONCE Foundation for Cooperation and Social Inclusion of People with Disabilities and the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT). They were adopted by the Resolution A/RES/669(XXI) of the General Assembly of UNWTO as a follow-up to the \u2018Recommendations on Accessible Tourism for All\u2019 of 2013.

In 2016, she founded Planet Abled, a travel company that caters to the needs of people with various disabilities, a group the World Health Organization estimates at 15 percent of the world\u2019s population. Arora isn\u2019t the only one pushing for more thoughtful travel experiences\u2014here\u2019s a look at six companies focused on accessible travel.\nTravel for All\nTravel for All has organized more than 5,000 vacations around the world for travelers with a variety of requirements, including cane users, slow walkers, hearing and vision impaired persons, travelers with complex health issues like dialysis and developmental disabilities, and wheelchair users. \u201cAs multiple sclerosis began to affect my own personal travel, I researched what resources could assist me with executing travel using my wheelchair,\u201d says CEO Tarita Davenock. \u201cI was shocked when I saw the lack of services.\u201d Every trip Travel for All plans comes with an accessibility specialist. \u201cWe research and give our clients the pros and cons of any area in the world before planning the trip, so our client knows what to expect while they are in that destination,\u201d says Davenock. \u201cMeticulous planning and great attention to detail are the keystones of keeping our vacations safe.\u201d\nA Seable group trip in Cambodia, where travelers visited the Wat Phnom temple Courtesy Seable Holidays\nSeable Holidays\nSeable Holidays specializes in trips for visually impaired travelers. All trips include trained chaperones\u2014who undergo a background check\u2014as well as inclusive sports and sensory activities like horse riding, scuba diving, kayaking, wine tasting, yoga, and tactile museum excursions. And everything is thoroughly vetted, with chaperones, activities, and accommodations tested by blind people before they\u2019re recommended by the company. While trips are on pause during the pandemic, Seable Holidays will bring them back in summer 2022.\nEasy Access Travel\nDebra Kerper and her team at Easy Access Travel accommodate most types of physical disabilities in their solo trips and mixed group tours. While Kerper sometimes relies on her own experiences as a traveler in a wheelchair, she says every trip needs to be tailored to an individual client\u2019s needs. To do so, the team spends time getting to know their clients to match them with the best vacation choice, and visits hotels and tourist spots for inspection, takes cruises beforehand, and collects information from trustworthy sources to ensure a safe, accessible, and fun experience.\nPlanet Abled\nNeha Arora\u2019s Planet Abled arranges customized tours for people with different types of disabilities, and also plans group tours that include non-disabled people. Their trips mostly take place in India and South East Asia, with plans to expand to countries in Europe, and popular activities include river rafting, skiing, trekking, and wildlife safaris. Some of their extra touches include assigning a travel buddy for the blind, seeking special permission from museums so clients can touch and feel the articles on display, and arranging for sign language interpreters for the hearing impaired.\nWheel the World\nAlvaro Silberstein, the CEO of Wheel the World, was paralyzed from the chest down after surviving an accident at 18. This didn\u2019t stop him from seeing the world\u2014he\u2019s since visited 30 countries on five continents. \u201cI realized that people with disabilities should be able to explore places as anyone else,\u201d he says. Most of his clients are adults or seniors with mobility disabilities and wheelchair users, and he can arrange solo travel or group trips. Silberstein wants to create more awareness around accessibility, and his company pays special attention to details like the height of beds, width of doors, and accessibility of bathrooms, compiling this information on the Wheel the World website. Their multi-day trips are designed with local tour operators with a focus on accessible travel, and includes access to adaptive bikes, beach wheelchairs, and equipment for hiking, skydiving, kayaking, scuba diving, and surfing\u2014they\u2019ve even planned Macchu Pichu trips for wheelchair users. The company makes sure \u201cprices are competitive and the pricing is the same no matter if the clients have a disability or not,\u201d says Silberstein.\nA quiet moment in Sintra, Portugal Courtesy Tapooz Travel/Aicha Nystrom\nTapooz Travel\nLaurent Roffe and Aicha Nystrom spent years volunteering with an organization that provides outdoors excursions to people with disabilities. \u201cWe have many friends in wheelchairs as part of our close community,\u201d says Roffe. \u201cI\u2019m a sea kayak guide and [Aicha] is a ski guide and this has always been a source of immense joy for us. Launching our accessible travel business was a natural extension of what we are and what we like to do.\u201d Their company, Tapooz Travel, specializes in trips for those with mobility issues, including visual and hearing impairment, rather than cognitive disabilities. When they have a client with a visual or hearing impairment, they make sure there\u2019s at least one guide trained in sign language, or have a guide who can help with things like reading the menu at the restaurant and providing a voice narration during a site visit. Their network also includes adaptive sports instructors, sailboat skippers, tribal elders, massage therapists, and hot air balloon operators, all of whom are trained to work with travelers with disabilities."}, {"title": "So, What Is Accessible Travel?", "article": "Accessible travel means travel with a disability, right? Well, yes and no\u2026\nThere\u2019s been a lot of talk about \u201caccessible travel\u201d lately \u2013 especially since the UNWTO designated World Tourism Day to Tourism for All in 2016. But what exactly is it, and why is it so important?\nThe easy answer is that a billion people (that\u2019s 15% of the world\u2019s population), lives with some sort of disability, and ensuring equal access to travel is simply the right thing to do. In fact, the first human rights treaty of the 21st century was the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and Article 30 specifically calls for States Parties to ensure that people with disabilities enjoy the benefits of tourism \u2013 which will be all too familiar to any reader of this article.\nBut accessibility is so much more than \u201cmerely\u201d a human rights issue. In fact, tourism professionals are increasingly realising that it offers an economic opportunity by tapping into a market that is neither niche nor small. It\u2019s a misconception that people with a disability don\u2019t travel. We do. Our travel aspirations are very similar to the general population and, although it\u2019s true that the unemployment rate for people with a disability is higher than that for the general population, many of us have jobs and disposable income. South African Tourism\u2019s powerful commercial, featuring a blind tourist, shows how a disabled traveller is actually no different from any other traveller.\nA number of studies, in particular one by VisitEngland, have shown that the value of the so-called Purple Pound is already large and, importantly, that it\u2019s growing as a proportion of the overall tourism spend. A recent study for Tourism Australia found that the accessible travel market is already larger than the much-vaunted Chinese inbound market and is growing more quickly! What these studies have also underlined is the \u201cmultiplier effect\u201d: people, especially those with a disability, don\u2019t travel alone. For example, I travel with my wife and three children, so if a venue isn\u2019t accessible for me as a wheelchair user, it loses the revenue from not one, but five people.\nFIND OUT MORE ABOUT WHAT INTREPID ARE DOING TO MAKE TRAVEL ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYONE HERE\nBut with an ageing population in developed countries, it\u2019s fast becoming a social and economic imperative to provide accessible infrastructure, when already one in five people in the US and Australia are living with disability. Rightly or wrongly, the market driver of this segment is actually not people who identify as disabled, but the 40% of people who retire with an acquired disability \u2013 a figure that rises to 56% at age 70 and 70% at age 80. Currently, this is the retiring Baby Boomer population \u2013 possibly the first generation in human history that won\u2019t be passing on its wealth to its offspring, but instead feels it has earned the right to enjoy a retirement that is lasting longer and longer and, in most cases, involves travel.\nForward-thinking destination management organisations \u2013 such as VisitEngland, Visit Flanders, the German National Tourist Board and Catalonia \u2013 have already invested significant resources into developing tourism experiences and information portals to enable people with access issues to plan their trips more easily. And their marketing strategies \u2013 and, importantly, choice of imagery \u2013 are specifically targeting an ageing demographic. To ensure their business remains sustainable, tourism service providers are also increasingly looking to offer accessible travel experiences to cater to this demographic.\nRELATED: MEET THE FAMILY TRAVELLING THE WORLD WITH THREE KIDS (AND A WHEELCHAIR)\nIn Australia, and much of the world, we use the term \u201caccessible travel\u201d. But by emphasising access (and with most people equating \u201cdisability\u201d with \u201cwheelchair users\u201d), the stress is immediately put on compliance \u2013 the costly business of installing ramps and accessible toilets \u2013 rather than the opportunity to differentiate and capitalise on a large and growing market. In fact, wheelchair users make up less than 10% of the disabled population. People with vision or hearing impairments outnumber wheelchair users, and people with invisible disabilities \u2013 including those living with long-term illness and severe allergies such as coeliac disease \u2013 represent up to 75% of the disabled population. Even when considering people with a mobility impairment, there are up to four times more people who don\u2019t use a wheelchair than do. Think of your parents or grandparents, who might not use a cane, but still need a hand rail when negotiating stairs and really appreciate the occasional bench for a rest when wandering around parks and gardens. So when we talk about this travel \u201csegment\u201d, it would be so much better if we used the term \u201cinclusive travel\u201d to put the emphasis on making sure experiences are able to be enjoyed by the widest possible number of people, instead of making them accessible to a relatively small number of wheelchair users.\nLooking at it this way means there are countless small changes that businesses of all sizes could make that would benefit a wide range of travellers with access needs: assistance dog toileting areas and water bowls; TVs with a captioning option; clear passageways with good colour contrast and signage; large-print black-and-white information materials (ask anyone over 55 about reading fancy menus in dimly lit restaurants\u2026); easy-to-read fonts such as Arial or Helvetica in signage or information materials; hearing loops; telephones that are compatible with hearing aids; vibrating pillow alarms; lowered counters or an occasional table in front of reception to welcome wheelchair-using guests or people of short stature; blocks to adjust the height of beds or tables; making sure cooking and cleaning practices cater for people with food allergies or chemical intolerances\u2026 the list goes on.\nRELATED: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND TRAVEL WITH A HEARING IMPAIRMENT\nAnd let\u2019s not forget the value of a website that\u2019s accessible for people with disabilities, particularly the vision-impaired (Intrepid Travel are working towards having their website accessible to more people \u2013 by aiming for AA Level of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines \u2013 by the end of 2020). Because here\u2019s the thing: the greater one\u2019s access needs, the greater the need for planning using detailed and accurate information. But, ironically, relevant and reliable information regarding accessibility is hard to come by; it\u2019s often either missing or hidden away under FAQs.\nWhat are Intrepid doing to accommodate travellers with disabilities?\nTara Kennaway, who heads up Accessible Travel in Intrepid\u2019s Product team, had this to say. \u201cWe know that travellers with disabilities are increasingly looking beyond specialised disability tour operators and want to travel in an authentic, exploratory way with their family, friends and other like-minded people. We still have plenty of work to do to make our trips more accessible and to be able to share our style of exploring the world with as many people as possible. It\u2019s been fantastic to see the engagement of our staff around the globe in this topic, from our sales teams responding to enquiries from travellers with disabilities, our local operators auditing our trips in country, and our group leaders delivering amazing experiences and customer service to our travellers.\u201d\nIn order to travel independently, trustworthy information is the key and that\u2019s Lonely Planet\u2019s reason for being: to help travellers to get the best out of their trip by providing the information they need to make informed decisions. We have made a modest start by producing access guides to different destinations. Our Accessible Rio de Janeiro guide was supplied to the International Paralympic Committee for visiting athletes; the IPC have already signed up for an Accessible Tokyo guide for the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics. We have exciting plans for this guide as we look to partner with new technology partner What3Words, an innovative navigational mobile app, to get people with a disability exactly where they need to be.\nSUBSCRIBE TO INTREPID\u2019S NEWSLETTER FOR TRAVEL TIPS, COMPETITIONS, GIVEAWAYS & MORE\nI have also curated the world\u2019s largest collection of online resources for travelling with access needs: Accessible Travel Online Resources, which was recognised by the UNWTO in 2016 as one of a handful of examples of best practice in accessible tourism and is now vastly expanded in the current third edition. Lonely Planet\u2019s Accessible Travel Phrasebook contains some 100 words and phrases to assist disabled travellers to make their needs known in 35 languages.\nLonely Planet also publish online articles by disabled travel bloggers (including yours truly) and regularly share and promote the cause to our huge social media following, leveraging our authority in a positive way, in the hope that this will create a knock-on effect. Judging by a recent survey of followers, in which 43% told us they want it to hear more about accessible travel, it looks as though we\u2019re on the right track.\nIntrepid is committed to making travel widely accessible, regardless of ability or disability. If joining a group trip is not practical we may be able to provide you with a private departure. Please contact our sales team for further information on any of our itineraries.\nAll images C/O Martin Heng."}, {"title": "Accessible Hotels and Experiences", "article": "We are looking for specialized travel agents If you are already working with accessible travel, you can join us and grow with us."}, {"title": "The world\u2019s most wheelchair-accessible travel destinations", "article": "At Lonely Planet, we believe that travel should be for all, and that accessible travel information is vital to making that possible. And with one billion people in the world living with a disability, the more resources there are for travelers with disabilities, the better.\nIn partnership with KAYAK.com, we\u2019ve rounded up the top wheelchair-accessible destinations around the world. Consider these spots for your future travel plans.\nHow KAYAK.com can help you find accessible accommodations\nKAYAK.com's search features can help travelers with disabilities find accommodations that meet their needs. To find accessible hotels, first search for hotels in your destination, and then check the \u201cIncreased accessibility\u201d box in the \u201cAmenities\u201d filters on the left-hand side of the page. This filter reveals properties that offer these features: wheelchair accessible, facilities for disabled guests, in-room accessibility, accessible rooms, facilities for disabled guests, and disabled access.\nPlaya del Carmen, Mexico\nOne hour from Canc\u00fan International Airport, Playa Del Carmen is a far cry from its more revelrous neighbor, yet still has accessible hotels and an accessible beach furnished with beach wheelchairs. There\u2019s even adaptive equipment to allow you to go snorkeling to enjoy the coral reef and green turtles. But the main reason for coming here is to visit the nearby and largely wheelchair-accessible Mayan archaeological sites, Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 and Tulum, a rare chance for the mobility-impaired to get up close to ancient ruins.\nSan Diego skyline from the harbor \u00a9 David Toussaint / Getty Images\nSan Diego, California, USA\nWith the Americans with Disabilities Act having just celebrated its 30th anniversary, much of the USA\u2019s infrastructure is accessible, but our pick is San Diego. Laid out along the classic grid system, generally flat and with a fully accessible trolley system, it also boasts a balmy year-round 64-80\u00b0F climate.\nThe historic Gaslamp Quarter is very wheelchair friendly, as is the massive Balboa Park (incorporating the slightly hilly San Diego Zoo), but it\u2019s the miles of beachfront promenade with beach wheelchairs available \u2013 including a motorized one with caterpillar tracks at Mission Beach! \u2013 that are the main attraction.\nBarcelona, Spain\nWith the national tourism authority and Catalonia in particular pushing accessible travel, it\u2019s no surprise that wheelchair users have been flocking to Barcelona. With 80% of the metro stations and 100% of buses wheelchair-accessible, as well as a relatively flat and cobblestone-free old city, getting around is a breeze.\nWhat\u2019s more, wheelchair users not only jump to the front of the queue for attractions such as the breathtaking Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, they often get in for free! You can explore the length of La Rambla and get around the famous Mercat de la Boqueria; even the beach has wheelchair access and people on hand to help.\nWelcome to Las Vegas \u00a9 Michael Phillips / Getty Images\nLas Vegas, Nevada, USA\nLas Vegas is undoubtedly one of the most accessible cities for people with disabilities in the US. Of course, the casinos and the venues hosting world-renowned musicians and shows are all wheelchair accessible, as are the vast majority of sites and attractions, many of which \u2013 like the Fountains of Bellagio and the Fremont Street Experience \u2013 are completely free.\nMore surprising, perhaps, the High Roller \u2013 the tallest observation wheel in the world, which takes 30 minutes to do a full revolution \u2013 is also wheelchair-accessible. And if you\u2019re after an adrenaline rush, wheelchair users can even enjoy the SlotZilla Zip Line and the Zoomline, which reach speeds of up to 35 miles an hour, or a hot-air balloon ride over the city.\nAdd to this a very wide choice in accessible accommodation, easy exploration along the wide sidewalks of the Strip, a fully accessible bus service that serves all parts of the city, and plenty of wheelchair-accessible taxis and you can begin to understand why Las Vegas has become something of a destination for wheelchair users.\nManchester, UK\nAlthough it was the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, much of central Manchester was rebuilt in the late 1990s, making smooth, wide, step-free pavements, as well as stepless entry into shops, restaurants and bars the norm \u2013 ideal for anyone with mobility requirements.\nNorthern England\u2019s cultural hub is well served by accessible public transport, leaving you free to pay homage at Old Trafford, learn about our industrial roots at the Museum of Science and Industry or shop with the goths at Affleck\u2019s. And if you\u2019ve had enough of the city, the Peak District National Park, with well-developed facilities for visitors with disabilities, is less than an hour away.\nA piazza in Taormina, Sicily \u00a9 Matt Munro / Lonely Planet\nSicily, Italy\nItaly might not spring to mind as a very accessible destination due to its narrow, often cobblestone streets. But there are a number of tour operators that cater to travelers with disabilities. Motor-impaired travelers can enjoy scuba diving, 4WD off-road driving, traditional Sicilian fishing and olive oil making \u2013 not to mention the gastronomic delights normally associated with Italy. Indeed, two Guinness world records have been set here: first paraplegic to dive to 59m and first blind woman to dive to 41m!\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania, USA\nAs one of the oldest cities in the US, you might not expect Philadelphia to be very accessible \u2013 but it is! While the Old Town may offer some challenges for wheelchair users, sidewalks are generally well maintained in the more touristed areas, with plenty of curb cuts and tactile markings.\nThis is particularly useful for wheelchair users considering most of the city\u2019s attractions are within a two-mile radius of the City Hall. The subway, opened in 1907, is only partially wheelchair-accessible, as is the overland rail network, but unfortunately the aging trolley system is not. However, the city\u2019s fleet of more than 1000 buses are all low-floor and wheelchair-accessible, as is the PHLASH tourist bus which runs a continuous loop downtown, stopping at many popular attractions, and costs only $5 for an all-day pass.\nNeedless to say, all of the city\u2019s most popular attractions \u2013 including Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell, Love Park and the Philadelphia Museum of Art \u2013 are fully wheelchair-accessible despite their antiquity. And when it comes to finding accommodations, there are plenty of wheelchair-friendly options right in the center of the action.\nSandridge Bridge in Melbourne, Australia \u00a9 Catherine Sutherland / Lonely Planet\nMelbourne, Australia\nWith its highly accessible public transport system and compact city center, Melbourne is one of the most accessible cities in the world. Visit the sporting capital of Australia armed with Lonely Planet\u2019s accessibility guide, Accessible Melbourne, a free e-book that includes the most up-to-date advice for travelers with special needs. Discover Melbourne\u2019s best wheelchair-friendly restaurants, enjoy spectacular scenery along the Great Ocean Road, and visit one of the world\u2019s best zoos as well as many of the parks that progressive Parks Victoria is opening up to visitors with access needs.\nLjubljana, Slovenia\nSlovenia\u2019s flat and largely pedestrianized capital, served by accessible electric vehicles, is well worth a visit. Most of its buses are accessible, but the city is so small, with plenty of ramps and curb cuts, you might rarely need them.\nThe city\u2019s main drawcard, the 16th-century Ljubljana Castle is reached via a funicular (free for people with disabilities and a companion) or train, both wheelchair-accessible. Many of Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik\u2019s famous bridges have recently been made accessible, and were joined in 2010 by the award-winning Butchers\u2019 Bridge, which allows wheelchair users access to boats.\nSingapore has established accessibility requirements into its city code \u00a9 Ninnat Fongsupa / 500px\nSingapore\nSingapore has to be the most accessible city in Asia and one of the most accessible cities in the world. Its universal code on barrier-free accessibility, in place for decades, plus increasing affluence have resulted in an infrastructure with stepless access to most buildings and no shortage of curb cuts.\nAlthough power wheelchair-friendly taxis aren\u2019t common, the accessibility of the mass rail transit (MRT) and buses makes them unnecessary. In Singapore, the question is not \u201cwhat is accessible?\u201d but rather \u201cwhat isn\u2019t?\u201d \u2013 from its street food hawker centers to its marvelous zoo.\nVienna, Austria\nLike many European cities, Vienna is steeped in history, being the center of the former Habsburg Empire and the musical heart of Europe. Unlike many of its counterparts, however, its cobblestones have been removed, as have many of the curbs.\nThe refurbished city is both flat and compact, with most central shops and cafes fully accessible. Getting around is relatively easy with elevators to the metro and plenty of low-floor trams. Most museums and places of interest are fully accessible, including the must-see Schloss Sch\u00f6nbrunn.\nYou might also like:\nTake a spin around the globe with an accessible travel expert\nWhat I have learned from travelling the world with a wheelchair"}, {"title": "6 of the World's Most Disability-Friendly Travel Destinations", "article": "This metropolis on the Mediterranean Sea has made great strides in recent years to become fully accessible for people with disabilities.

Strict building codes ensure that all new construction must be wheelchair accessible and almost every store and restaurant in the city is equipped with ramps, if needed. All banks and public offices offer services for people with sensory disabilities and a new law even requires all Hebrew-language websites to be optimized for screen reading software.

Now that restrictions are largely a thing of the past and travelers are free to move about the world, people are once again turning to travel for inspiration, relaxation, and the opportunity to experience something new.\nIt goes without saying that those opportunities should be available to everyone, regardless of race, gender identity, or sexual orientation.\u00c2\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been in the travel industry for more than 15 years\u00e2\u0080\u0094some might even say I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m an expert in the field. As a cisgender heterosexual white male, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m acutely aware that I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t experienced the hurdles or prejudices others have when traveling to certain destinations.\nHowever, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen first-hand how travel connects people and bridges divides, and I want that experience for others. As a leader in the travel industry, I feel like it is my duty to ensure that everyone has a good experience, and that means helping every traveler feel safe and welcome on every trip.\nWorking with destination marketing organizations, I have learned how destinations can create safe, welcoming, and inclusive spaces for diverse travelers. Here are some ways destination marketers can support that vision.\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nIntegrate values that match up with the needs of diverse travelers.\u00c2\nJust like with other products, travelers are \u00e2\u0080\u009cshopping their values.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They want inclusive, accessible destinations where they know they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll feel safe and welcomed. According to a recent survey from Accenture, approximately three out of every five travelers want their travel providers to share similar diversity and inclusion values.\nWhen LGBTQ+ and ethnic minorities responded, that number increased to nearly three out of every four travelers. In today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s market, travelers are no longer willing to compromise their beliefs, which means destinations must prioritize diversity and inclusion to create the right reputation and win travel bookings.\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nEnsure authenticity for your destination through collaboration and accessibility.\u00c2\nDiversity and inclusion go well beyond marketing; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a way of life and a belief system that requires destination marketers to think about the messaging they're putting out and what kind of destination they want to be. You must become advocates for both your destination and the travelers you want to attract, and advocacy isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just about race or gender.\nIt also includes abilities, such as making places wheelchair accessible or safe for those with autism, and meeting the diverse needs of all travelers. Above all, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to be authentic. This level of grit, sweat, and passion goes way beyond a hollow tagline. Travelers will see through any attempts to woo them without substance.\u00c2\nOne of the best ways to be authentic is to have open-minded conversations and learn from travelers who are looking for inclusive destinations. Rather than making assumptions or boxing in travelers, speak directly to Black, Latino, Asian and LBGTQ+ travelers to find out what they really want and embrace who they are. Travelers everywhere want the same thing\u00e2\u0080\u0094to feel included, safe, and able to explore without prejudice.\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nConnect with travelers along their journey throughout your destination.\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the best way for you to put your best, most inclusive foot forward? First, learn which travelers are coming to your destination. You likely have diverse travelers visiting your destination, so find out who they are and what they want and find ways to accommodate and inspire them.\nFor example, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re attracting LGBTQ+ travelers, you could put on more LGBTQ+-friendly events, which will naturally encourage travelers to return and attract new travelers. The best way to do this is to band together. Embracing diversity is a collective effort, so work with hotels, restaurants, and attractions in your destination to ensure travelers will have the same inclusive experience wherever they go.\nIn addition to knowing your travelers and working together, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to have the right toolkit. For example, Destinations International is creating diversity and inclusion toolkits for destinations. Your website is the face of your destination and a huge part of your toolkit, so periodically review your content. Do you use inclusive language? Would a traveler feel safe and comfortable when visiting?\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nDestinations leading the charge in making travel accessible for all.\nA number of destinations are working diligently to ensure travelers from all backgrounds feel safe and accepted. New York City\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website is rich with options for all travelers, ranging from The Black Experience to halal-friendly options and AAPI leaders.\nBoston recently launched its All Inclusive campaign, offering insights into Boston\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cultural diversity and helping travelers understand their options for accessibility around the city.\nThis year, Cleveland celebrated Freedom Fest in honor of Juneteenth, while Baltimore continues to celebrate its diverse population. Regardless of the destination, there are so many incredible ways to showcase diverse populations and traditions while welcoming travelers from all backgrounds.\u00c2\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nEnsuring inclusive and accessible environments into the future.\nI am proud to be part of an industry that connects human beings and helps us realize we are all the same. Travel is the best weapon to break down ignorance and judgment barriers. It is inspirational to witness destination marketers leading the charge to promote diversity and inclusion and make travel accessible to all people.\nBy creating inclusive, safe environments, DMOs are positioned to lead the charge in making sure travelers can explore the world in which we live.\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d"}, {"title": "Accessibility and Inclusivity in Tourism: Making Travel Experiences More Accessible for People with Disabilities", "article": "Tired of looking at tour options only to find that none of them seem to be accessible to people with disabilities?

According to the UNWTO, the gains were led in part by a 9 percent increase in international arrivals in Africa.\nAt a time when so many booming industries are technologies, tourism has become a powerful people-driven economic force, and with that power comes a massive responsibility. In many parts of the world, inequality is widening and wealth increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few. Tourism\u2019s potential for inclusivity presents an opportunity to distribute the economics of a booming global industry more broadly, to communities and people who not only have not benefited from tourism before but may face limited options for building better livelihoods for themselves and their families.\nOur upcoming Africa Travel Summit reminds us of how critically important it is that we get the tourism opportunity right. If done well, the benefits will stay within the communities in which the travel occurs\u2014distinguishing travel from many other industries that have found riches in Africa and exported them elsewhere. For us at Airbnb, the two-day summit will be a chance to hear and learn from some of the continent\u2019s most visionary entrepreneurs in travel and technology. The Summit is part of our $1 million commitment, announced in 2017, to expand tourism in Africa in ways that are local, authentic, sustainable, geographically diverse and yes, demographically inclusive\u2014what we call \u201chealthy tourism.\u201d\nTo help our broader community beyond Africa engage with the Travel Summit, Airbnb will showcase the work of African content creators, highlight African destinations and celebrate African hosts on our global social media channels for the week.\nAlso this month, you can join us in following Jessica Nabongo, who is now nearly 70 percent of the way toward becoming the first black woman to visit all 195 countries and states in the world. A dual citizen of both Uganda and the US, Jessica is using her Ugandan passport as well as her American one in order to raise awareness of outbound African tourism and the mobility gap between US and African passports. We\u2019ll be engaging with Jessica as she travels to Lebanon, Cyprus, Jordan and Beijing.\nBut opportunities to make sure underserved communities can benefit from inclusive travel aren\u2019t exclusive to developing countries\u2014they can be found in the world\u2019s most advanced economies.\nAirbnb\u2019s Srin Madipalli, Suzanne Edwards, and the rest of the team formerly of travel startup Accomable are working with our staff and local governments in the UK and Japan to find ways to expand both hosting and travel opportunities for people with disabilities.\nFor the start of Hispanic Heritage Month on September 15, Airbnb\u2019s own Juntos employee resource group will host a fiesta to celebrate our local employee, vendor, host and guest community and raise awareness of Latinx issues. We\u2019re also sponsoring 25 students as they attend the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute\u2019s Leadership Conference in Washington, DC, a gathering designed to empower young Latinx to take on issues affecting the US Latinx community.\nThis month also brings the second anniversary of Airbnb\u2019s anti-discrimination report, issued on September 8, 2016 as our first step\u2014of what we know will be many\u2014toward eliminating bias wherever possible from our platform. At Airbnb, we are committed to fighting bias through inclusion. Our ability to provide guests with an inclusive travel experience can only start with Airbnb being an inclusive travel company, looking internally and externally for opportunities to champion diversity and rid the platform of potential discrimination. We also believe that inclusiveness is self-perpetuating. As our CEO and Head of Community Brian Chesky often observes, when we travel and experience new surroundings and cultures, we realize people are 99-percent the same.\nAmong the many other initiatives we launched in releasing the report was Instant Book, an opt-in feature for hosts that reduces the potential for bias by allowing any guest to book a listing without securing prior host approval. While we have much more work to do here, I am pleased to report that two years after we launched the feature, Airbnb now offers 3 million listings, 60 percent of our inventory, that are instantly bookable.\nWe also recently took a step toward fulfilling our commitment to diversifying our senior leadership by appointing our first woman board member, Ann Mather, an incredible leader from Pixar and Disney and current board member of both Pixar and Alphabet. Ann joins former American Express Chairman Ken Chenault as our second independent board member.

Developing an inclusive & accessible system\n2. Creating safe spaces\n3. Designing an engaging & relevant system\n4. Exemplifying inclusion & accessibility\nHighlights from these important guidelines include providing training to staff on disability awareness and how to support travellers with disabilities, as well as collaborating with other businesses in areas where there are gaps in accessibility knowledge, experience, and services.\nThe report also emphasises the importance of fostering a respectful environment at all locations and for all activities, specifically reminding staff that their attitude towards people with disabilities plays an integral role in making that customer feel welcome and included.\nThere is also an importance given to developing accessibility features that are clear, overt, and which such travellers do not require special assistance from staff to use.\nFurthermore, the guidelines make clear that businesses should regularly and proactively engage travellers with disabilities in the creation of accessible products and services so that these meet their needs appropriately. They should also include accessibility features from the booking process, enabling travellers with disabilities to engage with the business before booking their travel service or product.\nStaff should also be empowered to address customer concerns as they occur or to engage other staff members if and where necessary, and inclusive marketing should be developed to dignify representations of all people and authentically represent them.\nGloria Guevara, President & CEO, WTTC said: \u201cWTTC is proud to release these important high-level guidelines, which will help Travel & Tourism businesses of all kinds, foster more accessible and inclusive environments.\n\u201cThe Travel & Tourism sector is one of the most diverse in the world. As the report shows and according to the World Health Organization, almost everyone will temporarily or permanently experience disability at some point in their life, and about 15% of the global population live with some form of disability. It is therefore imperative that we are inclusive.\n\u201cFurthermore, throughout its very nature, the sector promotes cultural exchange and understanding, therefore it makes perfect sense that we reflect these values within the sector as well. We look forward to seeing these guidelines make real change within the workforce.\u201d\nPeter Kern, Vice Chairman and CEO, Expedia Group said: \u201cTravel opens minds and drives better understanding between people from different cultures and identities, but sometimes travel isn\u2019t inclusive of or accessible for people with disabilities or accessibility needs. We are proud to have collaborated with WTTC on the creation of Inclusive & Accessible Travel Guidelines, a resource we will continue to collaborate on in future development, use in our own business and advocate for their adoption across the travel and tourism industry.\u201d\nStacy Ritter, President and CEO, Visit Lauderdale said: \u201cWe applaud WTTC on the launch of their Inclusive & Accessible Travel Guidelines. Travelers with disabilities should be embraced, welcomed and celebrated. Visit Lauderdale is committed to this, and we are proud to continue our inclusive and diverse global \u201cCelebrate You\u201d campaign which features disabled residents. To be truly authentic in promoting diversity and inclusion, we must include the disabled community.\u201d\nChris Nassetta, President & CEO Hilton, WTTC Chair said: \u201cThe Travel & Tourism sector has a unique role to play in building greater understanding in our global community as we welcome travellers of all backgrounds and abilities,\u201d said Chris Nassetta, President & CEO of Hilton and Chairman of WTTC. \u201cWTTC\u2019s Inclusive & Accessible Travel Guidelines provide valuable insight for our industry as we continue on our journey to create truly inclusive and unforgettable experiences for all.\u201d\nJohn Sage, President, Accessible Travel Solutions and the author of the guidelines said: \u201cPeople with disabilities (PwD's) have historically encountered many accessibility challenges while traveling.

The special issue explores theoretical approaches, foundations and issues in the study of accessible tourism from a futures perspective. Accessible tourism, as with any area of academic study is an evolving field of academic research and industry practice, set within a dynamic social context. The field is interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary, and is influenced by geography, ageing and disability studies, economics, public policy, psychology, law, architecture, construction sciences, technology and marketing. Past research has attempted to view, explain and unpack the inherent complexities (Darcy, 2010) within accessible tourism through a variety of lenses, including human rights, critical tourism, embodiment, customer segmentation and universal design (UD), to name a few (see Buhalis and Darcy, 2011; Buhalis et al., 2012). The special issue is timely given the operationalisation of the United Nations (2006) Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities by 160 countries. Central to the convention is the right for tourists with disability to access transport and built environment in Article 9 and tourism experiences, goods and services within Article 30. It is therefore pertinent to look at the future of accessible tourism and contemplate a number of issues including (but not limited to) the role of technology in reshaping disability; if and how policy makers and planners are addressing the impact of accessible tourism in a sustainable manner; the political influence of people with disabilities, who make up the largest minority group in the USA, on the future of tourism; the science fiction of exoskeletons and gene therapy as a new form of adventure tourist; and the future state of embodied identity and accessible tourism. The special issue provides the opportunity for contributors to take part in the current discourses on accessible tourism from a futures perspective, in order that we can understand, manage and contribute to the development of accessible tourism in the context of economically, socially and environmentally sustainable communities. Specific topics included conceptual and research papers, viewpoints and trend papers, both qualitative and quantitative, discussing topics relating to the future of accessible tourism. Papers include a range of issues including: inclusive destinations; accessible tourism in Development Planning (toward the UN Sustainable Development Goals 2030); policy-making for accessible tourism; embodiment; representation; law and legislation; architecture and universal design; inclusion/exclusion from experiences; markets and needs analysis; accessible transport; accessible events; accessibility and culture/heritage; accessible accommodation; education/training; and technology and applications. In contrast to the past 30 years, where disability and tourism research has been largely concerned with overcoming barriers that exclude certain people (see Smith, 1987), we can discern the contours of new movements in accessible tourism, whereby overarching principles and standards of sustainability, social responsibility and customer service. The delivery of equitable tourism experiences demand the attention of sector actors and stakeholders. Accessible tourism, in this context, should be seen in the future as much more than a range of supports to excluded target groups, becoming a set of ground rules and codes of practice which contribute to the development of all tourism offers and destinations in an inclusive way. If we should gaze into the crystal ball for a moment, we could envisage that tourism will not be defined primarily in terms of different target groups, since principles of responsibility, sustainability and accessibility will in the future inform the quality criteria to which all destinations should comply and be judged as part of destination competitiveness in increasingly global context. Customers will become more aware of their individual rights and also the need to protect and sustain communities and the natural environment, influencing tourism service providers to follow generally accepted rules of service quality, genuine interactivity and engagement with the local culture, people and resources. The capability of tourism providers to recognise those rights for all (e.g. of tourists with disabilities, Design for All, responsible behaviour, inclusion of the local communities in a transparent system of remuneration and participation, working opportunities for socially excluded group etc.) is going to be the threshold, which determines whether their offers will succeed or fail in the future. The tourism sector will increasingly be seen as having transformational power as \u201ca shaper of society\u201d, acting as a promoter of jobs and economic growth, a participant in regional and community planning and a partner in global development programmes. In addition, tourism should be developed as industry that promotes understanding, inclusion and well-being for all in an equitable way. Businesses, destinations and networks, that are already active in the field of accessible tourism and/or representing markets with different specific requirements will participate more widely in the mainstream, bringing their expertise and knowledge to bear on all those issues that are still seen as \u201cdifferent types of tourism\u201d. In the development of accessible destinations and experiences, the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (2015) will be playing an increasingly supportive role, especially through its Global Code for Ethics in Tourism and the recently published Manuals on Accessible Tourism (2015), produced by ONCE Foundation and the European Network for Accessible Tourism (2015b). Before discussing the papers that have been selected for publication we would like to set the scene by examining some major conceptual and policy development areas that we believe will have a significant influence on accessible tourism futures in the future. These include: dreams and aspirations of people with disability; demography; UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; destination competitiveness frameworks; UD; and the newly adopted UN Sustainable Development Goals for 2030. Each of these areas of influence will now be outlined prior to the papers for the special edition being summarised for their contribution to the future of accessible tourism.\nDefining and conceptualising accessible tourism Conceptualising accessible tourism to reflect all its dimensions and multidisciplinarity is critical for the future. The study of tourism and disability has been a reasonably recent phenomenon with the first detailed examination emerging from the leisure constraints literature (Smith, 1987). From this beginning, a great deal of individual studies are emerged that documented significant issues with demand, supply and coordination of travel for people with disability. More recently the field has started to mature with a conceptualisation that has sought to make sense out of the individual studies and provide an overall framework for understanding the phenomena. To assist with this conceptualisation, Buhalis and Darcy (2011) offer the following definition: Accessible tourism is a form of tourism that involves collaborative processes between stakeholders that enables people with access requirements, including mobility, vision, hearing and cognitive dimensions of access, to function independently and with equity and dignity through the delivery of universally designed tourism products, services and environments. This definition adopts a whole of life approach where people through their lifespan benefit from accessible tourism provision. These include people with permanent and temporary disabilities, seniors, obese, families with young children and those working in safer and more socially sustainably designed environments (adapted from Darcy and Dickson, 2009, p. 34 in Buhalis and Darcy, 2011, pp. 10-11). Importantly the definition recognises collaboration between stakeholders across demand, supply and coordination to recognise that disability is a complex construct involving mobility, vision, hearing, cognitive and other embodiments. The definition recognises that developing inclusive destinations and accessible tourism experiences also benefit other groups in the community. Hence, it contributes toward a greater social sustainability of the industry by including and, hence, providing for a much broader cross-section of consumers that has previously been considered by the industry. In understanding the importance of individuals with disability, the stakeholders they engage with and the influence of UD on the products, services and environments they wish to seek enabling experiences. Buhalis and Darcy (2011) suggests that to develop accessible tourism futures destination managers must strategically plan through the lens of UD. Figure 1 outlines the cyclical strategic approach to engaging UD approaches across disability and lifespan considerations as a foundation for developing future accessible destination experiences.\nDreams and aspirations of people with disability The dreams and aspirations of individuals play a fundamental role in shaping the choices, which lead them to travel. Among people who live with a disability, the idea of leaving behind one\u2019s everyday surroundings and going on a journey can create significant anxiety (Darcy, 1998). People with disability often can design or influence their everyday environment whilst they have routines to negotiate any difficulties and thresholds that exist. This does not apply to new environments whilst travelling, where they do not have prior knowledge, networks or influence on the design nor the potential barriers that are to face and the way to overcome them. Indeed, a recent European survey (GfK, 2015) suggests that up to half of people with disability do not travel on holiday, due to a combination of lack of reliable information, lack of funds and previous bad experiences. Yet, the desire to travel remains with studies showing that it is not a person\u2019s impairment that impedes their travel but a series of interpersonal, attitudinal structural constraints (Daniels et al., 2005; Darcy, 2003). In recognising that a person's impairment does not constrain their travel motivations, the boundaries to what is regarded as accessible tourism destinations and experiences are continually pushed by the accessible explorers who forge new pathways for others to follow.\nMillennium development goals (MDGs) and the UN global compact At the Millennium Summit in September 2000 the largest gathering of world leaders in history adopted the UN Millennium Declaration, committing their nations to a global partnership to reduce extreme poverty and setting a series of targets, with a deadline of 2015. These targets, known as the MDGs are a set of eight specific goals set by the 191 United Nations member countries that have the goal of halving world poverty by the year 2015: Eradicating extreme poverty continues to be one of the main challenges of our time, and is a major concern of the international community. Ending this scourge will require the combined efforts of all, governments, civil society organizations and the private sector, in the context of a stronger and more effective global partnership for development. The Millennium Development Goals set timebound targets, by which progress in reducing income poverty, hunger, disease, lack of adequate shelter and exclusion \u2013 while promoting gender equality, health, education and environmental sustainability \u2013 can be measured. They also embody basic human rights \u2013 the rights of each person on the planet to health, education, shelter and security. The Goals are ambitious but feasible and, together with the comprehensive United Nations development agenda, set the course for the world\u2019s efforts to alleviate extreme poverty by 2015 (United Nations Secretary-General BAN Ki-moon). The aim of the MDGs is to encourage development by improving social and economic conditions in the world\u2019s poorest countries. Since the MDG\u2019s were agreed to significant progress has been made. To date average overall incomes have increased by approximately 21 per cent. The number of people living in extreme poverty declined by an estimated 130 million. Chile mortality rates fell from 103 deaths per 1,000 live births a year to 88. Life expectancy rose from 63 years to 65 years. An additional 8 per cent of the developing world\u2019s people received access to clean water and an additional 15 per cent acquired access to improved sanitation services. In 2015 the UN countries will adopt a new sustainable development agenda and a new global agreement on climate change. The actions taken in 2015 are expected to result in new sustainable development goals that build on the eight MDG\u2019s (United Nations, 2015). Tourism has long been seen as having significant potential to help achieve the MDG\u2019s in developing countries. For example in 1990 developing countries had 18 per cent of international tourism receipts. By 2005 this had risen to 30 per cent and to date it continues to rise. There has been significant promotion of the direct economic links between tourists and the poor. Tourism may provide employment opportunities for marginalised groups, may bring direct income to individual communities and may promote equality in developing countries (Saarinen and Rogerson, 2013).\nUD supports destination competitiveness The tourism industry needs to design and deliver offerings and services that are suitable to all potential users and remove any physical or organisational barriers that can prevent visitation. UD incorporates the accessibility requirements of people with the widest possible range of abilities, so that the greatest number of people can use mainstream products and services without the need for adaptations or special interfaces. Additionally, mainstream products and services should use interface standards which match those of technical aids, so allowing disabled people to access and use mainstream equipment. UD has been defined as: Universal design is the design of products and environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design. The intent of the universal design concept is to simplify life for everyone by making products, communications, and the built environment more usable by more people at little or no extra cost. The universal design concept targets all people of all ages, sizes and abilities\u2019. The Universal Design approach goes beyond traditional design, which tends to focus on the \u2018average\u2019 user. Universal Design is a design approach, reflecting a way of understanding people\u2019s needs. It is not a list of particular solutions, measurements, or products \u2013 Universal Design is the way to reach the solution, contributing to social inclusion (cited in Center for Universal Design, 2009; and first articulated by Mace, 1985). Applying the principles of UD can be seen as a way of developing tourism environments, transportation, services and offers, underpinning sustainable communities and businesses. Today, according to a recent study by European Network for Accessible Tourism (2015a) and partners, less than 10 per cent of tourism suppliers in Europe offer \u201caccessible\u201d tourism services, while demand for such services is set to increase due to the ageing population and continuing upward trend in market demand. Adopting UD enlarges the target markets of destinations as well as ensures that more pleasant experiences can be delivered. Therefore it can increase the market base, reduce seasonality and support the competitiveness of destinations (Buhalis, 2000). Yet, few studies have examined accessible tourism in relation to destination management and only recently has accessible tourism been examined from destination competitiveness perspective (Dom\u00ednguez Vila et al., 2015).\nPapers in this issue To address these concepts and developments this special issue is bringing a range of papers together that discuss research on many accessibility tourism aspects. Naniopoulos and Tsalis (2015) discuss a methodology for addressing the accessibility of monuments. They focus on heritage attraction sites, highlighting the challenges with archaeological sites where interventions become problematic or even impossible. In doing so, they approached accessibility as a dual notion; accessibility of an area and its potential for independent physical access and movement around the monuments as well as perceived accessibility in terms of interpreting, understanding and learning from the environment. The methodology was applied to a number of byzantine monuments as part of a cultural route in the city of Thessaloniki in Greece, as case studies. Results provide both tools for assessing monument accessibility (process orientations and checklists) and insights into the needs of travellers with disabilities for more \u201cusable\u201d heritage attractions. Concluding remarks place a focus on the prerequisites of training and cooperation to allow for the future of accessible monuments to be realised. Tsalis et al. (2015) provide an interesting study on the challenges of implementing accessibility solutions, also within the context of protection, conservation, and management of historical centres and monuments. Viewed from a tourism perspective, archaeological sites and monuments are location bound and exist only in their original place. Hence, access to such sites enables unique and authentic tourism experiences. Discourses on objective, constructive and existential authenticity are of paramount importance when accessibility is concerned. This study provides relevant examples of accessibility interventions on six monuments as well as considerations on the design of the tools that assisted site interpretation and interconnection in a cultural route. Results demonstrate how accessibility improvements can occur while respecting the history, architecture and character of the monuments. The study concludes by emphasizing that it is primarily through providing greater access, that the \u201csocialisation\u201d of these monuments will propagate authentic tourism experiences in the future. Bowtell (2015) offers an examination of the market value and attractiveness of accessible tourism in Europe. Historic data were used to provide a forecast for 2025, while primary data obtained from travel and leisure companies provided insights into managerial perceptions. Findings show a very promising potential for accessible tourism market with significant projected revenues. However, a number of challenges including lack of awareness, cost of investments, complexity of customers\u2019 needs and legal inconsistencies within the EU, create barriers toward developing comprehensive solutions for accessible tourism. Authors provide recommendations on bridging demand and supply. Gillovic and McIntosh (2015) present an interesting study on stakeholder perspectives of the future of accessible tourism in New Zealand. The study provides insights into the current situation and the future propensity for an accessible tourism industry in New Zealand. A number of interviews with key stakeholders revealed that there is a need to develop a culture of accessibility that is perceived as the norm. Findings also include the business and demand arguments, but additionally highlighted the \u201cineptness\u201d of upper industry levels to recognize the opportunity of accessible tourism, exhibiting apathy and complacency instead. Authors conclude with recommendations for the future of accessible tourism in New Zealand which can easily be generalised for other regions. Zajadacz (2015) discusses the evolution of models of disability as a basis for the future development of accessible tourism. A review of medical, social, biopsychosocial, geographical and economic models of disability reveals the theoretical underpinnings and assumptions entailed in those. These are then linked to tourism, demonstrating that different models influence the tourism provision in terms of both products and services. Authors highlight the understanding of disability under different models toward diverse tourism experiences. Several suggestions are offered on the complementary of the models and the implications on the transformation of the accessible tourism industry in the future. Cruces Portales (2015) uses a scenario planning approach to envisage alternative futures for accessible tourism. With a timeframe leading to 2050, four alternative futures are unravelled through storytelling. The scenarios are built on a matrix that includes the opposing forces of empathy \u2013 apathy, and fear of loss and certainty of benefits. The resulting, aptly named scenarios (Eden Gardens, Golden Bridge, Wasted Future and State of Hope) showcase different behaviours, schedules of changes and insights. Authors conclude with strategic ideas and proposals for the future of accessible tourism.\nConclusion When exploring the future of tourism in this area two opposing trends can be observed: future societies are predicted to become more similar, more homogenous as a consequence of consumerism, globalisation and converging urban lifestyles. However, the accessible tourism market is characteristically diverse, with complex needs and the range of dreams and ambitions is boundless. Will future global travellers be able to access more varied and personal services or will increasing numbers of travellers give rise to greater standardization of services? Accessible tourism as an emerging field of study will influence tourism destination competitiveness in the future, whether that be from a human rights, emerging market segment or service delivery perspective. In this conceptual examination, we have presented implications of number of theoretical constructs and lenses through which accessible tourism will be influenced in the future. In this special issue, a number of future dimensions are explored that demonstrate how the field has moved from an examination of the intersection of disability and tourism, to one that is clearly defined through conceptual and definitional approaches as accessible tourism. There is a common thread amongst all the papers presented in this special issue. They focus around stakeholder collaboration, as a foundation for the future development of accessible tourism. It has been explicitly suggested that raising awareness amongst stakeholders is essential to overcome barriers inhibiting the application of solutions that enhance access. The importance of stakeholder collaboration across the accessible tourism value chain has been emphasized in a number of ways in this special issue. Improving accessibility of facilities, transportation, attractions and destinations more generally, demands the collaboration of a wide range of stakeholders including architects, designers, economists, local councils, policy makers, travellers with disabilities, historians and archaeologists to name a few. Therefore \u201csocialising\u201d tourism means that access can be granted only when a number of relevant stakeholders are in accord, work together and specifically developed strategies to target the accessible tourism market. Stakeholder collaboration is a key factor for developing accessible tourism solutions, recognising the value of the market and capitalising on it. Hence, a collaborative approach is required to recognise the complementary nature of the different paradigms; to re-shape and transform the future of the accessible tourism through influencing the tourism industry, contributing government organisations and the not-for-profit sectors. The strength and depth of stakeholder collaborations will determine alternative future realities; from a future where all cooperate and share benefits for all parties, to a fatalistic picture where each stakeholder is sailing alone because they consider their interests incompatible, and everything in between.

The Jakarta native is a frequent public transportation user, but his disability makes living in Indonesia a constant challenge. Cak Wawa\u2014as he nicknames himself\u2014often finds ojek (motorcycle taxi) declining to pick him up.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t give me any clear reason why they don\u2019t want [to take] me as a passenger. Although I told them I could pay, they ping-ponged me around other drivers.\u201d\nCak Wawa added that he had experienced this not only in Jakarta but also in other cities, including Malang and East Java. Suffice it to say getting around has become an impossible task.\nWheelchair-accessible vehicles (WAV) are still relatively hard to find in Indonesia. Many wheelchair users still have to depend on informal modes of transportation, such as small-sized vehicles that have been modified to accommodate their needs. Individuals primarily own and operate these altered taxis, sometimes leased.\nDreams: Triyono, founder of the Difa Bike, a disability-friendly 'ojek' (motorcycle taxi), hopes that he can play a role in creating an inclusive transport for the community in Yogyakarta. (Courtesy of Triyono) (Courtesy of Triyono/.)\nTriyono, the founder of Difa Bike, a motorcycle taxi service based in Yogyakarta for the disabled, states that despite their ojek having been modified into a wheelchair-friendly three-wheeled vehicle, they are unable to fill the demand in certain areas.\n\u201cEven if you are at the airport, it\u2019s hard to find a WAV if you\u2019re in a wheelchair,\u201d Triyono said.\n\u201cSo our role, as one of the informal modes of transportation, is not only to provide accessible transportation but also to educate and raise awareness that disability communities also deserve the right to have accessible transportation.\u201d\nRodhi Mahfur, 31, a painter, says that most of the available WAV are too costly for poor Indonesians.\n\u201cThey are mostly available at the airport or the hospitals. When you call [the WAV taxis] to your house, they will charge you more,\u201d Rodhi said.\nStruggling to find access\nThe National Team for Accelerated Poverty Reduction (TNP2K) reports that as of March 2019, more than 9 percent (23.3 million) of Indonesia\u2019s population have disabilities. Monash University\u2019s research in 2017 found that most people with disabilities in Indonesia do not use assistive devices such as hearing aids and walking aids. For example, according to the data, 80 percent of those who report vision impairment do not have glasses and 28 percent of those who need a cane do not have one.\nAs for wheelchair users, the available public transportation does not support their needs. Based on data released by Monash University, 38 percent of the disabled community in Indonesia do not have access to public transportation, 48 percent choose not to use the available public transportation and only 14 percent use general public transportation.\nFaisal Rusdi, 47, a painter and a member of the Association of Mouth and Foot Painting Artists (AMFPA), said that his mobility to ride in taxis and cars is often too challenging.\n\u201cSomeone has to lift me from the wheelchair to the car\u2019s seat and vice versa. Ideally, if suitable taxis are available for the disabled community, wheelchair users don\u2019t have to move and can remain [seated] in their wheelchairs,\u201d Faisal said.\nWith the lack of access to disability-friendly transportation, sometimes Faisal and his wife, who is also a wheelchair user, opt for an electric wheelchair to reach their destination.\n\u201cSometimes we use the electric wheelchair on the road, as long as the destination is near. But it\u2019s perilous because we\u2019re in the outer lane of the road,\u201d Faisal continued.\nCalling for change: Faisal Rusdi, a wheelchair user in Bandung, describes that not all WAV in Indonesia are designed to be compatible with all kinds of wheelchairs. (Courtesy of Faisal Rusdi) (Courtesy of Faisal Rusdi/.)\nDeliani Siregar from the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy said that the debate about inclusive public transportation in Indonesia remained unresolved for the past years - she uses the parable of \u201cwhich one comes first, the chicken or the egg.\u201d\n\u201cAt this moment, the available transportation hasn\u2019t been able to meet the needs of the disability community, especially for those who use wheelchairs,\u201d Deliani said.\n\u201cBecause the challenge that we are currently discussing is not only about accessibility but also the design of the transportation, which is equally important,\u201d she continued.\nDeliani also addressed that if this matter remains unresolved, it can eventually affect the activities and mental condition of people with disabilities.\nBudi Ratmoyo, 48, a tailor who volunteers as an ojek driver in Sidoarjo, stated that a 23-year-old customer of his with cerebral palsy has not been out of the house for 16 years after his mother could no longer carry him on their motorcycle.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a challenge because that\u2019s the only person he could rely on. Every day, I meet different individuals who face challenges. We have to open our eyes and hearts to individuals who aren\u2019t able to access the world because they don\u2019t have transportation options,\u201d Budi said.\nDeliani further adds that Indonesia\u2019s sociocultural ableism is another challenge in building accessible transportation.\n\u201cFor example, we suggest that bus stops shouldn\u2019t be too narrow, but the feedback we often received was \u2018Are there even any disabled people with high mobility?\u2019 \u201d Deliani said.\nTheir voice: Deliani Siregar explains that accessible design for the disability community is a key, but in reality, it is often forgotten. (Courtesy of Deliani Siregar) (Courtesy of Deliani Siregar/.)\nSupport needed\nCreating disability-friendly transportation requires a collective effort. Triyono explained that taxis are still preferable to modified motorcycles in larger cities like Jakarta, with higher mobility.\n\u201cSurely, the modified motorcycle helps. We cannot deny that even though it\u2019s not 100 percent convenient. Could you imagine if someone had to go to the hospital for a health check-up with a three-wheeled vehicle?\u201d Triyono added.\nHowever, when it comes to providing WAV in taxi form, Triyono says there are financial challenges. A wheelchair-accessible car is twice the price of an altered motorcycle, roughly up to Rp 7 million (US$ 458).\nRichie Bestianto, the general manager of Motion Aid, a WAV provider based in Jakarta, says that modifying a WAV with a capacity of 250 kilograms requires Rp 19.5 million.\nFor Triyono, the cost of alteration has not been able to meet the demand from other more significant areas in Yogyakarta and Jakarta. Especially during the pandemic, Triyono has been struggling to run his business mainly due to fewer tourists coming to Yogyakarta.\n\u201cWe [Difa Bike] used to have 15 wheelchair-accessible cars supplied by individuals, but then we only had one during the pandemic. The providers asked for their car back,\u201d Triyono said.\nFor now, they have not lost hope.\nDeliani further added that the desire to create accessible transportation for the disabled community is crucial.\n\u201cThe operator of the transportation needs to remember, if a space is considered accessible for the disability community, it will be more accessible for non-disabled persons,\u201d Deliani concluded."}, {"title": "Wheelchair Accessible Transportation Options When Traveling", "article": "For wheelchair users, accessible transportation can become a fundamental consideration when planning a trip. Having accessible options to get around your destination is crucial, specifically for those who struggle to transfer to a vehicle seat or rely on a heavy power wheelchair that is too large to fit in the trunk.\nAt Wheel the World, we are on a continuous search for accessible transportation options to offer our travelers and to build our multi-day trips. Although it can be challenging to find many viable options depending on the destination, many places are becoming increasingly more accessible.\nExploring Your Options\nThere are several options available in most places that can help make transportation more convenient and accessible. Depending on the flexibility you want while traveling, or the destination you\u2019re planning a trip to, you may be considering:\nWheelchair accessible rental vans\nWheelchair accessible public transportation (buses, trains, subways)\nWheelchair accessible rideshares (Uber, Lyft, Taxis)\nIn this post you\u2019ll find some tips on how to navigate ground transportation while traveling, and we\u2019ll take a look at some of the different options a wheelchair user may have during their trip.\n\u2708\ufe0f This is for ground transportation specifically, but for an in-depth guide on flying as a wheelchair user, we covered that in this article.\nWheelchair accessible van with a ramp.\nFirst, Do Your Research\nIt is important to do thorough research well in advance to determine which route is the best for you. While some destinations may not provide many accessible rental vehicles or ride-shares, others offer exceptional wheelchair accessible public transportation, which may be the best option for traveling within the city. Places like San Fransisco, New York, and Europe as a whole have excellent public transportation. In either case, it is important to research as much as you can so you\u2019re well prepared and know what to expect.\nConnecting with other travelers can be a great resource for preparing for your trip. Ask questions, share your experiences, and connect with like-minded travelers in our Facebook group Wheel the World - Accessible Travel Community.\nWheelchair Accessible Vehicles (WAVs) \u267f\nWhat is a Wheelchair Accessible Vehicle(WAVs) and what does it mean? WAVs are specially designed (or adapted) vehicles of any kind that allows wheelchair users to enter and exit the vehicle with ease. These vehicles have lowered floors and a ramp or lift that allows the wheelchair to be rolled into the vehicle. The interior is designed to accommodate the wheelchair user, with features such as wheelchair tie-downs and accessible controls that allow the user to travel in their wheelchair safely. Some WAVs are also equipped with features such as hand controls for driving, power lifts, and transfer seats to make the transportation experience even more comfortable and convenient for the user.\nAccessible ramps into van.\nWheelchair Accessible Rental Van Services\nFor those who require more specialized transportation, accessible vans can be a great option. These vehicles are designed specifically to accommodate wheelchair users, with features such as wheelchair lifts and tie-downs. Accessible vans can be scheduled through phone or email.\nAt Wheel the World we work with several wheelchair accessible van providers in various destinations around the world, such as Morocco, Chile, Mexico, Costa Rica, France, Spain, Israel, and Qatar, to name a few.\n\u267f Need help with transportation, van rental, and/or insurance for your trip? Request a quote , hear back in less than one business day.\nWAV Options at Ride-Sharing Services\nRide-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft provide accessibility through their WAV option. Typically, the vehicles are minivans or something similar, and the rates are usually the same as a standard UberX. Keep in mind that these aren\u2019t available in every city, so if you\u2019re considering using ride-sharing on your trip, make sure you research to see if it\u2019s a viable option at your destination. At this time, some of the current cities where WAV is offered and has solid availability:\nNew York\nSan Francisco\nPortland\nBoston\nSeattle\nToronto\nWheelchair accessible transportation in Costa Rica\nAccessible Public Transportation\nMany public transportation systems offer wheelchair accessible options, such as buses and trains, while others offer paratransit services for those who are unable to use traditional public transportation. It is important to plan ahead and research the accessibility options in your area because not all public transportation systems are fully accessible.\nIn the U.S, public transportation is not accessible in every destination:\nBus transportation is accessible in almost every city, but can be very ineffective due to the lack of coverage in many cases. Research the bus routes at your destination and see if it would be a good option for you.\nThe San Francisco BART is almost 100% accessible. Every station has elevators, and although they are not very clean, it covers a majority of the city.\nOutside of the U.S there are many cities that we have identified with good public transportation. A few examples are:\nBarcelona, Spain - Great train and bus systems that are fully accessible.\nLondon, England - The buses have great accessibility and the Underground has a number of accessible stations, especially the ones around downtown.\nBerlin, Germany - Most subway stations are accessible.\nSantiago, Chile - The majority of subway stations and buses are accessible. Staying in the Vitacura/Providencia area of the city will allow you to use the subway and buses and go around accessible areas of the city.\nWheelchair lift into public transportation (bus)\nWheelchair Accessible Dispatch Taxis\nWheelchair-accessible dispatch taxi services are another great option for those who require specialized transportation. These services allow users to schedule a ride in an accessible taxi that has been designed to accommodate wheelchair users. These services can be scheduled in advance, allowing you to plan you transportation needs more conveniently. However, it's important to keep in mind that not every destination may offer these services, so it's important to research your options in advance.\nConclusion\nAlthough finding accessible transportation can be a challenge, there are several options available to wheelchair users. By exploring these alternatives, you can find the transportation option that works best for your needs and helps you maintain your independence and mobility. Remember to plan ahead, check availability, and always prioritize safety when traveling.

But it is now increasingly recognized as an integral part of high-quality, sustainable transport systems, with benefi ts accruing to all clients.\nMuch has been done to improve the accessibility of transport systems in recent years. One of the key factors in progress has been the indispensable exchange of experience \u2013 both good and less successful \u2013 among countries having committed to working towards better accessibility.\nThe ECMT has prepared this Guide to Good Practice in order to facilitate such an exchange of experience. It addresses both countries where improvements to accessibility are under way, and those that are just now making that commitment.\nWith examples from recent experience in a wide range of countries, this Guide updates the ECMT\u2019s 1999 Guide, pointing to areas where progress has been made as well as to those where challenges persist."}, {"title": "Fostering an inclusive urban-transit system", "article": "Using public transport can be stressful and even unsafe for many commuters, including but not limited to women, senior citizens, and people with disabilities. From minor annoyances to violent crimes, getting from point A to B can be fraught with risk.\nGoal 11 of the United Nations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sustainable development goals exhorts member states to provide safe, affordable, and accessible transportation for everyone, especially those who find themselves in vulnerable situations. And yet, while disparate initiatives have been launched around the world to make public commutes safer and accessible for everyone, a survey of the United Nations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and other international agencies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 research, plus our own analysis, suggests there is still more to be done across the three main stages of the commuter journey: planning and booking, the predeparture experience at boarding areas, and the travel itself.\nIn this article, we consider just how inclusive global public-transit systems are and explore ways that municipalities, urban planners, and other key stakeholders can assess and accommodate the end-to-end needs of all travelers.\nHow inclusive are our public-transit systems?\nOver the past decade, international organizations such as the United Nations have made the concerted effort to study inclusivity in urban-transport systems as a means to guarantee fair opportunities for all commuters. The insights that have come out of this endeavor fall under two broad themes.\nFirst, a collection of studies\u00e2\u0080\u0094including the UN Commission on the Status of Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Safe cities and safe public spaces for women and girls study\u00e2\u0080\u0094provide analyses of the key safety and communications issues that public-transport operators need to address. These include reducing violence and harassment on public transit, ensuring safer nighttime commutes, and providing clear, effective, around-the-clock communication between operators and travelers.\nSecond, a separate stream of research studies the main barriers that limit inclusion on public transit for women, people with disabilities, and low-income travelers, among others. Critical obstacles include, among others, poorly designed transportation, high ticket prices, inadequate safety regulations, and schedules that fail to account for the travel patterns of commuters with specific needs.\nAs they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve become aware of these issues and limitations, many public-transit system providers and urban planners have launched initiatives to address them\u00e2\u0080\u0094to limited effect, however. Such campaigns and programs have typically been introduced in an ad hoc manner rather than integrated into the overall public-transport system.\nSome cities, such as Los Angeles and Santiago, focused on surveying travel patterns of public-transit users, while others, including a major European capital and a large city in Southeast Asia, mostly worked on communication campaigns to raise awareness of nighttime safety. Other cities\u00e2\u0080\u0099 efforts were limited in scope. In Madrid, for example, on-demand bus stops were introduced on suburban routes during specific times to reduce the walking distance home for female passengers.\nFrom booking to travel: An end-to-end approach to inclusion\nShare From the inside out: Inclusion in the urban-transport workforce According to the latest Kantar Inclusion Index, less than half of transportation employees believe that their organizations are actively pursuing inclusion. In addition, the sector reports above-average workplace bullying/harassment and situations in which employees were made to feel uncomfortable. Fostering greater inclusion for public-transport employees requires providers to start with an accurate assessment of where they stand. Then, they can begin embarking on diversity, equity, and inclusion\u00c2 (DEI) transformation journeys to reshape their way of working. Diversity refers to workforce composition across various identity-related characteristics, such as gender, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, and disabilities. Equity focuses on ensuring that identity is not predictive of opportunities or workplace outcomes. Inclusion refers to the degree to which an individual feels that they can bring their authentic selves to work, enabling them to contribute in a meaningful and deliberate manner. From our experience working in this space, public-transport providers can gain DEI awareness in different ways. Sometimes targeted, eye-opening workshops aimed at uncovering deeply rooted unconscious bias represent a wake-up call for organizations: having diverse subsets of colleagues collaborate to identify unexpected biases in their ways of thinking is sometimes sufficient to trigger top-management engagement toward a new way of working. In other cases, transport agencies go even further and fully train their staff on civil-rights issues, among others, and on potential biases toward underrepresented categories. In other cases, achieving a profound understanding of the internal level of inclusivity can require more time and various sessions at all levels of the organization. Once companies agree that room for improvement exists, the journey to a fully inclusive work environment unfolds. After the first step of assessing and building the fact base through company-specific business cases, other challenging steps of the process remain: Architect (development of key performance indicators and road map): beginning with a solid awareness and understanding of the internal level of inclusion, companies develop a plan by designing a portfolio of initiatives linked to specific and tangible objectives, prioritizing them on feasibility and expected impact. The initiatives plan is complemented by the identification of pilots to be launched and tested, either on selected perimeters or on a company-wide basis.\nAct (test and learn with quick programs): companies start launching pilots and initiatives on target business units, functions, and geographies, in line with the agreed-upon implementation plan. As the plan unfolds, insights from pilots can be used to learn and refine ongoing and future initiatives.\nAdvance (build on success and track progress): in the core phase of the implementation, companies get the program to full scale. This requires a strong monitoring and accountability structure, alongside a proven knowledge codification and sharing system to constantly improve idea generation and the implementation of initiatives. Among public-transportation providers, one of the most notable programs in the past few years was launched by the roads and transport authority in a major city in the Middle East, which focused on including and elevating women\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, it created a dedicated fund for high-performing women employees and another initiative for \u00e2\u0080\u009cpeople of determination,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which included ad hoc employment and training programs.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time for urban-transport providers to draw from our collective understanding of inclusion and design and implement an urban-transport system that works for everyone. While this article focuses on the customer journey, travel providers should not miss the opportunity to transform their own organizations as well (see sidebar, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom the inside out: Inclusion in the urban-transport workforce\u00e2\u0080\u009d).\nTo further contribute to our existing understanding of travel and inclusion, we conducted our own research. We surveyed more than 20 different public-transport operators around the world and identified key requirements and initiatives for an inclusive public-transport system. We found that while there are many initiatives to enhance inclusion, they are typically not part of an integrated, 360-degree framework. We believe that a comprehensive and integrated approach to inclusive transportation comprises initiatives that fall into six categories (Exhibit 1).\n1\nWe mapped these requirements and initiatives along the commuter journey, which we broke down into three parts: the booking stage, the predeparture stage, and the actual travel experience (Exhibit 2). In each phase, there are actions travel providers can take to address specific pain points. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll explore those actions using the example of a rail-based journey\u00e2\u0080\u0094although the conceptual principles here can be applied to other forms of urban transport, such as buses and ferries.\n2\nThe booking stage\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s common nowadays for people to use navigation apps to find the most convenient route to their destination. The would-be passenger decides on the starting and arrival points, preferred mode of transport, and time of travel. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll factor in potential route disruptions (and explore alternatives, if necessary), how crowded the commute might be, and whether there are any loyalty-program benefits to be accrued.\nThis stage presents a number of potential pain points for some commuters. For instance, a wheelchair user may not know if a train station is equipped with elevators and if there are design barriers that may make it difficult to board and alight from a train.\nSome cities have tried to create a more accessible and safe experience for senior travelers. For instance, Salzburg has launched initiatives to promote the use of public transport among older people. The city has hosted \u00e2\u0080\u009cmobility days,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and pamphlets on commuter safety can be found in all train stations. Salzburg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bus drivers are also trained to be extra vigilant around older passengers, and vehicles are designed with senior citizens in mind. These initiatives have reduced accidents among older people and increased awareness among the remaining population.\nOur research points to a number of actions urban-transport providers can take at the booking and planning stage to create more inclusion. For instance, they could create pooling options in their travel apps so that passengers could choose to commute in groups. They may offer special rates at this stage as well, to disabuse people of the idea that accessible travel options are more expensive than standard ones. Passengers could also be given the option to easily share their itinerary with their friends and loved ones for an additional layer of oversight.\nTravel providers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 mobile apps may also provide a direct line of communication between the traveler and the provider and are a tool providers may want to use more strategically. Safety issues could be flagged immediately. Information about security measures, optimal travel times, and easy-access facilities could be relayed through this channel when passengers check and confirm their itinerary. The Transport for London, for instance, allows for just this with its dedicated journey planner; the app lets would-be passengers optimize their journey from the booking stage.\nPredeparture phase\nArriving at a station or terminal can be an overwhelming experience, with hordes of people crisscrossing in every possible direction\u00e2\u0080\u0094businesspeople rushing to catch their trains with barely minutes to spare, families trying to herd rowdy children toward the right platform, and buskers plying their craft.\nFor many, the predeparture phase looks like this: you receive a push notification from your travel provider with information about your train\u00e2\u0080\u0099s departure time. To get to the platform you go through a thermal-imaging scanner that checks your temperature, you make it past the turnstile with an electronic ticket, and you find the correct platform, where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll wait to board.\nFor groups or travelers with specific logistical needs, this phase can be full of hazards. If they are early for their train, for instance, such passengers may find few accessible waiting spaces to accommodate them.\nThere are a number of ways urban-travel providers can improve the predeparture experience for all travelers. They may want to integrate important safety and pooling information into the departure reminder, noting the location of accessible facilities and safe train cars\u00e2\u0080\u0094carriages with an attendant, conductor, or security officer. Visual \u00e2\u0080\u009cnudges\u00e2\u0080\u009d and cues could promote positive behaviors, such as offering assistance to people with mobility constraints or to pregnant women. In stations where longer wait times are common, more rooms for nursing mothers and a greater number of dedicated waiting areas could be created. Treating the station as a civic space by promoting community-focused activities\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as increasing retail outlets and installing open pianos\u00e2\u0080\u0094could also enhance commuters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sense of safety.\nIn 2006, the city of Graz, Austria, upgraded its key stops to make them both more accessible and livable; and, targeting both safety and comfort in its train platforms and stations, the Canadian cities of Ottawa and Toronto created designated Transecure waiting areas.\nTraveling and arriving at the destination\nThere are a number of actions travel providers can take to make passengers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 journeys inclusive once they are on board. For instance, it is possible for travelers on most trains to track their progress while en route\u00e2\u0080\u0094but it may not always be clear how to request help in cases of violence of harassment. Particularly when it comes to late-night routes, passengers may be in near-empty train cars. To provide peace of mind for all passengers, urban-travel planners should install highly visible GPS panic buttons throughout the system, as they have in New Delhi and Bangalore.\nCommuters with specific needs could be directed to the train\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safe wagons with security personnel and closer supervision. Pregnant women or passengers with specific physical needs could wear \u00e2\u0080\u009cMay I sit\u00e2\u0080\u009d pins to alert other commuters to give way to them. Travel providers could also make it easier for these commuters to find information about connections and the safest ways to get to the next boarding point.\nWhile our case study focuses on rail travel, alternative transport modes may offer other opportunities for greater inclusion. The flexibility afforded by bus travel presents more options for making the travel experience safer. Passengers could be allowed to alight, on request, at specific time slots, for example, from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m., to reduce the distance between the drop-off point to the final destination. This is exactly what the city of Madrid put in place, arranging on-demand night bus stops on interurban bus lines.\nCreating an inclusive urban-transport system doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop the moment a passenger gets off the train. Transport providers could review the arrival experiences and partner with security companies to provide additional support or with taxi and rideshare companies to provide special rates for arriving passengers.\nSetting the goal of an entirely accessible public-transport system is becoming increasingly common in major cities worldwide. Barcelona has committed to a 100 percent accessible underground metro system by 2024, and Seattle is already fully wheelchair accessible.\nOther municipalities and travel providers can do the same by undertaking a thorough assessment of customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 needs along the whole journey, mapping the potential pain points, and implementing targeted initiatives to address them. Of course, this process is an iterative one; any initiatives launched should be evaluated and refined over time. The systemic, end-to-end approach outlined in this article should help make traveling in our cities truly safer for all."}, {"title": null, "article": null}, {"title": "Special Needs Travel Adventures", "article": "After you officially book a Trips Inc.

They can help you get destination-specific vaccines, medicines, and information. Discussing your health concerns, itinerary, and planned activities with your provider allows them to give more specific advice and recommendations.\nGet travel insurance. Find out if your health insurance covers medical care abroad. Travelers are usually responsible for paying hospital and other medical expenses out of pocket at most destinations.

Websites such as Mobility International USA and the European Network for Accessible Tourism provide information on overseas medical equipment providers.\nConsiderations for Air Travel\nU.S. airlines and flights to or from the United States on a foreign carrier must provide all travelers with the same travel opportunities, regardless of disability, unless doing so would endanger the health or safety of other passengers and crew.\nSome airlines may require up to 48 hours advance notice and 1-hour advance check-in for certain accommodations. Check with your airline for more information. Airlines are required to provide people with disabilities access to the aircraft, an aisle seat, and a seat with a removable armrest.\nIf you plan to fly within a foreign country or between countries while abroad, the regulations above might not apply. Check with the airline to find out what accommodations it makes for people with disabilities.\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation has a toll-free hotline, 800-778-4838 (voice) or 800-455-9880 (TTY), for more information about the rights of air travelers with disabilities. Also, check federal relay 711 or the Transportation Security Administration\u2019s website for answers to questions about screening policies, procedures, and checkpoints. Find out if there are specific policies for devices such as wheelchairs, portable machines, batteries, respirators, and oxygen.\nConsiderations for Cruise Ship Travel\nMost cruise ships can accommodate travelers with disabilities. Check with the cruise line before booking to make sure any accommodations you\u2019ll need are available, such as medical oxygen or a wheelchair. Some cruises cater to travelers with special needs, such as patients on dialysis.\nTraveling with Service Animals\nMost airlines allow a trained service animal to accompany a qualified individual with a disability. Be sure to check with your airline to ensure that your service animal meets the airline\u2019s requirements, including necessary documentation. Service animals may not be allowed to enter all countries and are subject to animal importation regulations, such as quarantine regulations. Your service animal will also be subject to US animal import regulations when flying to the United States. Prior to traveling with your service animal, find out what documents and testing may be required to enter another country and return to the United States.\nContact the US embassy or consulate of the destination country for information on possible restrictions for service animals and any quarantine, vaccination, and documentation requirements.\nConsult a veterinarian prior to your trip and ask about tips for traveling with service animals.\nContact destination hotels to make sure they will allow service animals.\nAfter Travel\nIf you traveled and feel sick, particularly if you have a fever, talk to a healthcare provider and tell them about your travel. If you need medical care abroad, see Getting Health Care During Travel.\nMore Information"}, {"title": "What Are Reasonable Accommodations at Work (and How to Request Them)?", "article": "Forage puts students first. Our blog articles are written independently by our editorial team. They have not been paid for or sponsored by our partners. See our full editorial guidelines .\nReasonable accommodations are adjustments to a hiring process, work environment, or job responsibilities so an employee with disabilities can apply for or perform their job. Depending on the type of disability, accommodations can look many different ways \u2014 from transcription services to accessible parking outside the office. In this guide, we\u2019ll share more about reasonable accommodations, examples, and how to request them in your job search or at your first job.\nWhat Are Reasonable Accommodations at Work?\nWork accommodations are changes to a hiring process, work environment, or job responsibilities that allow an employee with a disability to apply for or do their job.\nWhat makes an accommodation \u201creasonable?\u201d An accommodation is \u201creasonable\u201d if it doesn\u2019t create an undue hardship on the employer \u2014 meaning it isn\u2019t exceptionally difficult or expensive for the employer to make the accommodation.\nNot every employee with a disability needs the same accommodation; accommodations depend on the individual\u2019s needs and how it affects their ability to do their job. For example, reasonable accommodations can include:\nTechnical access, like an employee with impaired hearing who uses a transcription service\nPhysical accommodations, like a ramp for the office to make it accessible to an employee in a wheelchair\nChanges to work schedules, like more flexible hours for an employee who has mental health challenges and may need more rest periods\nThese accommodations make it so every employee, regardless of ability, can succeed in their job.\nPower BI Passionate about advocating for employees with disabilities and other underrepresented groups in the workplace?

Some common reasonable accommodations include:\nChange of job tasks\nFlexible work schedules, including remote jobs\nImproved office accessibility\nSpecialized software or equipment\nAlternative supervisory structure or methods\nAlternative formats of communication (written versus verbal communication, for example)\nReassignment\nHere\u2019s how some of these accommodations function for various disabilities.\nADHD\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that can affect an employee\u2019s ability to focus, prioritize tasks, stay organized, and control impulses. In the workplace, accommodations for ADHD allow these employees to be productive in a way that works for them \u2014 mainly through adjustments to work schedules and environments.\nExamples of ADHD accommodations at work include:\nA flexible schedule that allows an employee to work when their energy and focus levels are best\nA private or quiet workspace so an employee can work distraction-free\nTask organization tools or software to help an employee prioritize and stay on task\nAdjustments to meetings to make them shorter, have more breaks, and provide a clear agenda beforehand\nMental Health\nMental health conditions like depression and anxiety can affect an employee\u2019s ability to be productive, work closely with others, and work on a typical 9-5 schedule.\nExamples of reasonable accommodations for mental health conditions include:\nFlexible work schedules for an employee who needs to take time during the workday for treatment\nRemote work for an employee who experiences intense social anxiety\nPermission to bring a support animal to the office\nSupportive and direct supervision style for an employee who needs positive reinforcement and feedback\nA quiet work environment, either by providing a space for the employee to work distraction-free or technology like noise-canceling headphones\nPhysical Disabilities\nReasonable accommodations for physical disabilities vary widely and depend on the kind of physical disability a person has. For example, a blind employee and an employee in a wheelchair need very different accommodations to perform their jobs.\nExamples of reasonable accommodations for physical disabilities include:\nAssistive technology, like screen readers, voice recognition software, Braille displays, and specialized input devices to help an employee process or communicate information\nAdjustable workstations for an employee with a physical impairment\nWheelchair accessible offices\nFlexible work arrangements, including working from home, for employees who find it challenging to commute or need time for treatment\nAdjusting job tasks that require physical labor\nDiabetes\nEmployees with diabetes may experience a range of symptoms depending on how their diabetes affects them. For example, some employees may have diabetic neuropathy, a nerve disorder caused by diabetes that affects nerves in the hands and feet. Others may experience diabetic retinopathy, an eye condition that can affect vision.\nExamples of reasonable accommodations for diabetes include:\nFlexible work schedules or regular breaks to check blood glucose levels, eat, take medication, or go to the bathroom\nAccess to technology to regularly check blood glucose levels\nPermission to use a chair or stool for an employee with diabetic neuropathy\nA larger screen, screen readers, or Braille displayers for an employee with diabetic retinopathy\nPregnancy\nPregnancy is not a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); however, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA) is a new law that requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations to employees who experience limitations because of pregnancy, childbirth, or other related medical conditions. These work accommodations include adjustments to work schedules and changes to job tasks.\nExamples of reasonable accommodations for pregnancy in the PWFA include:\nFlexible hours or additional time to eat and rest\nAccess to accessible parking spots\nLeave or time off to recover from childbirth\nExcusal from strenuous physical activity or activities that may expose an employee to compounds not safe for pregnancy\nPregnancy and Breastfeeding\nWhile the PWFA does not have any specific guidance about breast milk pumping, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) specifically covers nursing mothers in the workplace.\nThe PPACA includes two main reasonable accommodations:\nBreak time for an employee to express breast milk, up to one year after giving birth\nA private place out of view and free of intrusion, other than a bathroom, to express breast milk\nReturn to Work for Parents and Carers Coming back from parental or caregiving leave?

According to the ADA National Network, you\u2019re allowed to request \u2014 and must gain access to \u2014 reasonable accommodations at work, as long as:\nYou\u2019re qualified for the position, meaning you\u2019re able to perform the job\u2019s essential functions\nYou meet the definition of \u201cdisability\u201d according to the ADA, meaning you have a \u201cphysical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities\u201d\nThe accommodation doesn\u2019t create an undue burden on the employer, meaning an exceptional difficulty or expense\nReasonable Accommodation Request Process\nReasonable accommodations, by law, must be addressed on a case-by-case basis. According to the ADA Network, the process is as follows:\nAn employee must disclose their disability to their employer and explain how the disability is affecting their ability to do their job. The employee and employer discuss how the disability is affecting the employee\u2019s ability to work and share potential solutions. If the employee\u2019s need for an accommodation is not obvious, the employer can request preliminary documentation of the disability. The employee and employer both provide input on what an effective solution would be. The employer makes the final decision on what the accommodation(s) will be. The employer either implements the accommodation(s) or denies the accommodation request.\nIt\u2019s up to the employee to bring their accommodation request to the employer. While the employer does have the final say, if an employee has a disability, it\u2019s their right to receive reasonable accommodations. They should actively participate in discussions on what those accommodations should be.\nHow to Request Reasonable Accommodations When You\u2019re Just Starting Out\nSo, you\u2019re thinking of requesting reasonable accommodations, whether you\u2019re in your first job search or have just landed your first role. We\u2019ve outlined the step-by-step process, but how should those conversations go?\nIt\u2019s best to be proactive and straightforward while focusing on how you\u2019ll be able to thrive in the role.\n\u201cThe best way is to confront and call out the problem and your expectations directly,\u201d says Roza Szafranek, founder and CEO at HR Hints. \u201cIt is good to clearly name from the beginning what is important to us and ask, for example, about arrangements for hybrid work, the need to work with a mask in common spaces, or the distance between desks in the office, if these are important to us.\u201d\nRequest Examples\nKraig Kleeman, CEO and founder of The New Workforce, a company that connects businesses with talent, gives an example of how someone on the job hunt with ADHD \u2014 who knows they might need extra breaks during the day \u2014 might request accommodations.\n>>MORE: How Can You Tell if an Employer Values Diversity and Inclusion in the Workplace?\n\u201cResearch the companies you\u2019re applying to and check if they have info on accommodations on their websites,\u201d Kleeman says. \u201cOnce you get an offer, that\u2019s the time to discuss your needs.

Share what you need to thrive in your role. It\u2019s a collaboration; you and your employer work together to make it happen. Be ready with any required documents and keep a positive attitude. Focus on how you can rock your new job.\u201d\nWhat to Do If an Employer Denies Your Reasonable Accommodation Request\nUnfortunately, not all reasonable accommodation requests will be approved.\n\u201cApplication rejection happens often,\u201d Szafranek says. \u201cThe most common reasons are savings and lack of willingness or ability to take on more responsibilities in terms of managing the problems of the employed team. Company and team leaders are focusing on optimizing and simplifying everything that does not bring additional revenue and increases the efficiency of the team\u2019s work, so if they consider that, for example, they are unable to negotiate work from the office, they will not budge.\u201d\nWhile an employer might feel strongly that their decision is final, you can try to negotiate a rejection or take further action.\n\u201cIf they do say no, don\u2019t lose heart,\u201d Kleeman says. \u201cTalk to them, explain why it\u2019s essential, and try to work something out. It\u2019s a two-way street. If you do take further action, contact the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for help. They can mediate or investigate. If all else fails, you can consider legal action. But remember, that\u2019s usually the last resort. So, don\u2019t be afraid to speak up and advocate for your needs.

These modifications enable an individual with a disability to have an equal opportunity not only to get a job, but successfully perform their job tasks to the same extent as people without disabilities. The ADA requires reasonable accommodations as they relate to three aspects of employment: 1) ensuring equal opportunity in the application process; 2) enabling a qualified individual with a disability to perform the essential functions of a job; and 3) making it possible for an employee with a disability to enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment.\nAccommodations are sometimes referred to as \u201cproductivity enhancers\u201d. Reasonable accommodations should not be viewed as \u201cspecial treatment\u201d and they often benefit all employees. For example, facility enhancements such as ramps, accessible restrooms, and ergonomic workstations benefit more than just employees with disabilities. Examples of reasonable accommodations include making existing facilities accessible; job restructuring; part-time or modified work schedules; acquiring or modifying equipment; changing tests, training materials, or policies; and providing qualified readers or interpreters. Here are some more examples. Many job accommodations cost very little and often involve minor changes to a work environment, schedule or work-related technologies:\nPhysical changes Installing a ramp or modifying a rest room Modifying the layout of a workspace\nAccessible and assistive technologies Ensuring computer software is accessible Providing screen reader software Using videophones to facilitate communications with colleagues who are deaf\nAccessible communications Providing sign language interpreters or closed captioning at meetings and events Making materials available in Braille or large print\nPolicy enhancements Modifying a policy to allow a service animal in a business setting Adjusting work schedules so employees with chronic medical conditions can go to medical appointments and complete their work at alternate times or locations\nThese are just a few example.

In disability employment antidiscrimination law and policy, perhaps the most important driver of the inclusion command is the \u201caccommodation principle,\u201d which requires that employers make reasonable adjustments to tasks and places of work to enable full and equal participation by qualified individuals with disabilities [2].\nIn the seminal 2004 U.S. Supreme Court case Tennessee v. Lane [3], the late Justice Ruth Ginsburg wrote of the centrality of the ADA\u2019s accommodation principle:\nIncluding individuals with disabilities among people who count in composing \u201cWe the People,\u201d Congress understood in shaping the ADA, would sometimes require not blindfolded equality, but responsiveness to difference; not indifference, but accommodation. Central to the Act\u2019s primary objective, Congress extended the statute\u2019s range to reach all government activities, [], and required \u2026 \u201creasonable accommodations.\u201d\nUnder the ADA, the word \u201cdiscriminate\u201d consequently includes failure to make reasonable accommodations to the physical and mental limitations of a qualified individual with a disability, in the absence of an \u201cundue hardship\u201d on the business [1]. Discrimination includes denying opportunities to a job applicant or employee if such denial is based on the need for the entity to make reasonable accommodations to that person\u2019s physical or mental conditions [1]. By directing employers to accept responsibility, within reason, for accommodations (up to the undue hardship ceiling), the ADA\u2019s Title I sets the ADA apart from other U.S. civil rights legislation.\nThe importance of the accommodation principle to disability inclusive employment law and policy is manifest [4]. The goal of offering equal employment opportunity to everyone, regardless of disability, is meaningless if the new hire uses a wheelchair and the sole entrance to the workplace is up a flight of stairs. The right to work rings hollow if people who are deaf or hard of hearing, who are blind or have low vision, or who have reading or cognitive disabilities cannot use or access a company\u2019s web-based technologies [5]. Opportunity is foreclosed when an employer will not alter work schedules within reason, or bars telework or remote work, without consideration for qualified individuals with episodic or mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety, that require flexibility [6].\nTitle I of the ADA defines the accommodation principle to include, within reason, making facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, as well as job restructuring, part-time and modified work schedules, remote work and telecommuting, modification of equipment and devices, and other effective means of enabling qualified individuals with disabilities to perform essential functions of their jobs, whether traditional or non-traditional [1]. The ADA gives substantial weight to an employer\u2019s definition of \u201cessential\u201d job functions and the extent to which such tasks may be done effectively with accommodation.\nResearch shows the low costs and the numerous benefits of the accommodation principle. Most workplace accommodations incur de minimis or near-zero costs [7,8,9,10]. Employers in most cases can accommodate people with disabilities with relative ease, formally or informally. Further, there are far-reaching, positive ripple effects from a \u201cculture of accommodation\u201d for all [11, 12]. At the organizational level, accommodations improve employee productivity, morale, and tenure. If an organization promotes a \u201cculture of inclusion,\u201d a climate of flexible and supportive approaches, it furthers effective and innovative accommodations and productive outcomes for all employees and for itself [9, 10, 13,14,15], and it enjoys the benefits of attracting and retaining qualified workers [13]. The ripple effect extends even further: promoting economic opportunity for people with disabilities produces a corresponding decrease in their need for federal disability insurance and other governmental support funding, along with a resultant increase in tax revenues.\nThe research thus suggests the value, to all of society, of documenting, devising, and promoting strategies to increase awareness and implementation of the accommodation principle across organizations of different sizes and types, and across market and labor sectors.\nAt the thirtieth anniversary of the ADA, the articles in this special topic section consider, variously, the future of disability-inclusive employment in light of how the accommodation principle works in contemporary society, and in light of its historical precedents. The accommodation principle as part of a disability inclusive employment paradigm is a concept of the late twentieth century. It contrasts with earlier vocational rehabilitation programs for people with disabilities, which historically were based on medicalized conceptions of disability [1, 16]. This \u201cMedical Model\u201d of disability focused on individual deficits, with impairments conceived of as infirmities that precluded participation in the mainstream economy [17, 18]. It cast people with disabilities in a subordinate role to doctors, rehabilitation professionals, and governmental bureaucrats, each of whom aimed to \u201chelp them,\u201d when \u201cdeserving,\u201d adjust to a society structured around the convenience, design, and interests of people without disabilities [17].\nIn contrast, the modern model is the Social Model of disability, which is sometimes called the Ecological Model, and, in the context of the ADA, the Disability Civil Rights Model. This model, however named, includes the accommodation principle. It has changed society\u2019s perspective. It has altered the historical paradigm from a focus on a health status to be cured or rehabilitated, and even pitied, towards acceptance of individual differences as human traits that are accommodated in employment, and generally in society, as a natural part of the human experience.\nThe Social Model of disability has taken on exceptional importance due to the health and economic emergency arising from the global pandemic [19, 20]. The pandemic is challenging public and private entities in unprecedented ways to spur both traditional and new forms of employment and economic opportunity for all. But people with disabilities are presently experiencing among the highest rates of job loss, as compared to those without disabilities, from the health and economic emergency [21, 22].\nLest we forget, too, people with disabilities often own or identify with multiple minority identities that are themselves marginalized in our society. People with disabilities, for example, may also be women, people of color, and/or individuals identifying with different sexual orientations and gender identities [23,24,25]. Disability diversity and inclusion (\u201cD&I\u201d) programs that incorporate the accommodation principle for all identities\u2014what my colleagues call \u201cD&I+\u201d\u2014are crucial to people with disabilities who seek to enter or re-enter the mainstream economy."}, {"title": "Accommodations: What they are and how they work", "article": "You may hear the term modification.

Tourism experience and tourism ecosystem from perspective of tourists with mobility disability 4.1 Mapping the tourism experience through the tourism customer journey The tourism customer journey (TCJ) involves mapping the entire journey of a tourist, outlining all the stages a person goes through when experiencing the need to move for tourism purposes (\u00c5str\u00f8m, 2020). The TCJ draws on the more general concept of the customer journey, which is the \u201cprocess a customer goes through, across all stages and touch points, that makes up the customer experience\u201d (Lemon and Verhoef, 2016, p. 71). Mapping customer journeys is a popular and effective way to grasp the entire tourism customer experience (Rosenbaum et al., 2017). If the tourism product as a whole was offered by one single company, the general customer journey concept could be easily applied to tourism in the same way as it is applied to other kinds of services (e.g. banking, retail and insurance services). However, as will be discussed shortly, tourism is a more complex service because of the number and variety of co-creating actors and the relationships amongst them. Here, we apply the TCJ to the context of people with mobility disability. A similar analysis could be applied to people with other disabilities (Al\u00e9n et al., 2012), resulting in different and specific types of TCJs. Given the complexity of applying a contextual study to all types of disabilities, this study focusses only on people with mobility disability, but the same method of analysis could be easily extended and replicated. From the very beginning of the TCJ, even when individuals are planning their holiday, they will encounter a series of actors, whose number will dramatically increase in the subsequent stages of the journey (Buhalis, 2000; Saraniemi and Kyl\u00e4nen, 2011). This is because tourism involves a complex ecosystem that has many actors who influence to a greater or lesser extent the experience perceived by individuals during their journey (Gretzel et al., 2016). The quality delivered by each actor clearly influences the overall quality of the tourist's overall experience (Ciasullo, 2017). Sometimes this phenomenon is emphasised because the quality performance of one provider has a spillover effect on the customer's evaluation of the quality performance of other components of (or actors in) the tourism ecosystem (Bourdeau et al., 2007). That is, a negative performance in one part of the journey may have a negative halo effect on the entire journey, considering that the tourist (beyond being the focal actor of the ecosystem) (Storbacka et al., 2016) is the only actor to see all the components of the ecosystem. Similarly, a positive performance in one of the moments of truth (Normann, 2001) has the potential to compensate for a series of negative performances in other parts of the journey. Overall, there is a remarkable risk of tourist dissatisfaction, which is heightened when the person undertaking the journey has some form of disabilities, such as when they have reduced mobility. These arguments can be illustrated through the construction of the TCJ for a holiday that is independently conceived and designed by a person with mobility disability who has time to spend in a destination to be selected and does not want to rely on standardised offerings delivered by tour operators. For this purpose, we draw on the general framework suggested by Baccarani and Cassia (2017), according to which a holiday is articulated and occurs in the following four main stages (Figure 1): destination choice and trip design; outbound trip; staying at the destination; transfer to another destination or return home. Each of the four stages of the TCJ develops through the processes that are outlined below. The points marked with the sign (*) in the following list represent critical aspects for people with mobility disability because they can entail various problems related to accessibility because of the presence of architectural, communication, cultural, technological and relational barriers. The first stage of the TCJ \u2013 destination choice and trip design \u2013 encompasses the formation of a tourist's experiential expectations drawing on the following elements: time available for the journey, motivations triggering the need for the journey, any previous personal holiday experiences, any previous indirect holiday experiences (e.g. information collected online, online reviews and e-word-of-mouth), dialogue and interactions with disability organisations and associations, information available online or printed specialised magazines and publications, information available in promotional materials delivered by tourism destinations, means of transportation available and reservation of such transportation (*), type of accommodations available and reservation of such lodgings (*), definition of a hierarchy of suitable destinations (*). The second stage of the TCJ \u2013 outbound trip \u2013 covers the most complex part of the holiday. In fact, the anticipated benefits of the planned holiday take shape during this stage. In the case that the tourist uses a personally owned means of transport suitable for their disability to reach the boarding point and that the travel is done by aeroplane, this stage includes the following elements: printing the boarding pass, estimating the time that they must leave home to reach the airport (this estimation is informed by customers' sensitivity to risk and the information available), preparing their luggage, planning which road or highways to take to reach the airport, stopping at rest areas to meet their needs or the needs of others or to comply with the requirements of the transport providers (*), parking in an area near the airport (*), checking in their luggage (*), reaching the boarding point (*), complying with any safety control procedures (*), waiting at a boarding gate (*), boarding the aeroplane (*), flying to the destination (*), disembarking and claiming their luggage (*), searching for a local means of transport to reach the accommodation facility (*), arriving and being welcomed at the accommodation facility (*). The third stage of the TCJ \u2013 staying at the destination \u2013 represents the core of the holiday with all that a person desired for their time away on holiday. This is a stage of personal enhancement in relation to seeking knowledge, values and relationships. During this stage, the core value of the holiday emerges and is influenced, at least in the beginning, by the travel experience, which may increase or diminish the initial enthusiasm. This stage encompasses the following points and involves a variety of actors at the destination: planning itineraries, visits and activities that the tourists wish to engage in at the destination based on their previous knowledge and the information available to them, visiting cultural, artistic and natural sites in an area (*), forming relationships with the host community (*), selecting from a variety of foods and eateries on offer (*), participating in local guided tours (e.g. wine tours) (*), using local means of transport (*), purchasing souvenirs. The fourth stage of the TCJ \u2013 transfer to another place or return back home \u2013 is similar to stages two and three described above, and includes the overall evaluation of the perceived quality in relation to the expected quality developed in stage one. In addition to the steps described above, which imply a variety of relationships between the tourist and several different actors, the context of a holiday is even more complex because tourist safety and care must be specifically assured, particularly for PwD. These conditions must be guaranteed by higher-level welfare systems, with which the tourism service network should be able to cooperate effectively. In summary, in this TCJ the tourist benefits from a variety of services that globally support the creation of the tourism experience, which is phenomenologically determined and perceived by the beneficiary (i.e. the tourist) (Vargo and Lusch, 2016). 4.2 Identifying the tourism ecosystem in relation to tourists with mobility disability This subsection identifies the actors that form the complex tourism ecosystem in its co-creation of the tourism experience. During each of the four stages of the TCJ, many different actors contribute to the formation of the overall tourist experience by delivering or not delivering the expected quality. In the tourist's experience, all these actors form a tourism service ecosystem, even if they represent only a set of services that the customer has assembled (Baccarani and Cassia, 2017). In fact, a service ecosystem implies a self-contained, self-adjusting system of resource-integrating actors connected by shared institutional arrangements and mutual value creation (Vargo and Lusch, 2016). However, this level of coordination amongst all the actors involved in the co-creation of tourism experience does not yet exist. Below, we outline the actors involved in each of the four stages of the TCJ. In the first stage, the tourist imagines, designs, plans and anticipates the pleasure of their holiday. To complete this stage, the tourist relies on the information provided by actors such as airlines and accommodation providers and interact with them directly or through intermediaries. For people with mobility disability, the dialogue and interactions with disability organisations and associations play an important role. As highlighted by the UNWTO, disabled peoples' organisations (DPOs) play a key role in accessible tourism because \u201cthey are mediators in understanding specific needs, existent barriers and the ways to bridge them\u201d (UNWTO, 2020). At this first stage of the TCJ (destination choice and trip design), quality is evaluated on the basis of the completeness and clarity of the information provided by multiple actors. All the actors involved in this first stage of the TCJ represent the holiday-design ecosystem (see Figure 3). In the second stage of the TCJ (outbound trip), at least the following 12 actors are involved, and this number could be even higher if a tourist decides to use public means of transport (instead of a personally owned means on transport): producers of publications or websites and intermediaries distributing information that guides the tourist in selecting the destination during the season in which the journey takes place; booking organisations through their websites; transport providers, including those preparing the service timetable; highways operators who have information about roadworks and any related delays; firms executing the roadworks who have information about any interruptions that may affect the roadworks and travel times; firms managing the rest areas and a variety of other services that may be required; firms managing the parking areas who may assist customers to reach their boarding point after having parked their vehicle; airport company that manages the departure airport that offers a welcome service and controls safety processes; airline that is responsible for checking in passengers, assigning boarding gates, flying times and delivering baggage; airport company that manages the arrival airport that offers welcome services and provides information to customers and about local means of transport; local transport service operators; accommodation services providers. Therefore, a tourist interacts with at least 12 different co-creating actors during the second stage of the TCJ. These actors are connected in the tourist's mind but they are practically linked only through market relations and they do not coordinate their decisions and behaviours. Thus, it is unlikely that the tourist will be able to complete the second stage without experiencing some level of difficulty. For example, the tourist may miss the flight because of planned roadwork not being properly notified in advance or because of other unforeseen events. To evaluate the quality of the overall experience, the tourist considers all the components of this stage of the TCJ, comparing expected and actual quality. In particular, the tourist will appreciate the problem-solving capability of the actors. This second group of actors represents the travel ecosystem (see Figure 3). In the third stage of the TCJ (staying at the destination), the tourist stays at the chosen destination where they interact with at least the following actors: firms who manage welcome and accommodation services; restaurateurs; local inhabitants (local community); local transport service operators; local merchants with their value propositions; agencies who organise local tours so that customers can explore local traditions, culture and products; municipalities; organisations protecting tourists' safety and care. This third stage of the TCJ has fewer actors than the second stage. However, the variety of actors is greater because during the tourist's stay at the destination, the tourist will engage in activities such as trying different types of food offerings to appreciate the local food culture, which means they will have contact and engage with more actors. Similarly, to explore local artistic, natural and cultural heritage, the tourist will select from a variety of opportunities that are available at the destination. In the third stage of the TCJ, the local community also plays a fundamental role in welcoming tourists and in co-creating their tourism experiences. In fact, in addition to the technical and functional\u2013relational components of the quality delivered by local services (Gr\u00f6nroos, 1990; Kang and James, 2004), the welcoming atmosphere experienced at the destination plays a central role in the formation of the overall perceived quality (Nunkoo and Ramkissoon, 2011). All the actors involved in the third stage of the TCJ represent the staying at destination ecosystem (see Figure 3). The fourth stage (transfer to another place or return back home) is a replication of the stages two and three outlined above and encompasses the tourist's comparison between the overall perceived quality and the expected quality developed in stage one. The actors that populate the tourism service ecosystem are largely the same for tourists with and without disabilities. However, tourists with disabilities can select amongst a smaller number of offerings than tourists without disabilities. Moreover, actors are required to have adequate technical and relational skills to deliver tourism services to tourists with disabilities. Thus, tourists with disabilities must face greater difficulties in their travel-related choices because of the presence of several types of barriers (see Figure 2). The tourism ecosystem described in this sub-section is depicted in Figure 3. The quality of the tourism experience emerges from the relationships established within this tourism ecosystem through which resources are combined and value is co-created. Such relationships have different degrees of smoothness depending on the presence of several barriers.\n5. Barriers to accessible tourism: can digital ecosystems represent a solution? Drawing on the arguments developed so far, this section identifies in detail the barriers to fulfilling tourism experience co-creation for PwD. The intention of the discussion is to understand whether and how digital ecosystems could represent a viable solution to such barriers. The identified relationships amongst the co-creating actors have not been harmonised to deliver the overall quality desired by the tourist because they are regulated by pure competitive mechanisms, emphasising the value of a specific part of the ecosystem instead of the value of the entire ecosystem. However, in tourism, competition amongst companies of the same sector can exist only once a territory as a whole is attractive. As highlighted in several studies (Baccarani et al., 2019; Barnes, 2004), the territory is not a physical space, but a highly complex viable subject emerging from all co-creations over time through the interactions between nature and human beings. Thus, the territory emerges from the relational synergies between the people who inhabit it and the environment. Therefore, the stronger the synergies established in a certain location, the higher the location's attractiveness and value, which then make the location a platform in which individual actors can compete against each other with their propositions. That is, the long-term attractiveness of a territory and of a tourism destination derives from the actions of the entire ecosystem, within which the actors must aim to do their best through a continuous dialogue with the territorial ecosystem. For this purpose, tourism must be conceived in a holistic manner by deploying planning efforts that involve all the actors of the ecosystem and engage all the potential beneficiaries of the tourism offering \u2013 be they are tourists with or without disabilities (Darcy et al., 2020). This perspective cannot ignore a series of barriers that determine biases in the co-creation of a location that provides tourism services for all tourists and particularly for those with mobility disability. In detail, the following barriers to accessible tourism can be identified (Gillovic et al., 2018; Michopoulou et al., 2020; Nyanjom et al., 2018): informational barriers; architectural barriers; political barriers; cultural barriers; relational barriers; technological barriers; entrepreneurial myopia. These barriers are outlined below from the perspective of PwD. Informational barriers refer to the difficulties that a person with disabilities faces when desiring to autonomously evaluate and choose a means of transport, accommodation, a holiday itinerary or simple holiday activities such as shopping. While there is usually a great deal of information is available for such services, informational needs of PwD leads to higher levels of complexity. For example, even when information about tourism services is available it can difficult to verify. Architectural barriers refer to the obstacles PwD encounter on holiday when engaging in activities such as accessing means of transport, moving in different locations, and using sidewalks and roads. Inconveniences related to architectural barriers can often also be experienced by people without disabilities (e.g. finding it difficult to understand the subway system) but the barriers are emphasised for PwD. Architectural barriers are directly connected to political barriers, which refer to the needs of PwD in the context of a political agenda. While political discourses highlight the ideal of acting to eliminate architectural barriers, political actions are often guided by urgency, short-termism and narrow-sighted electoral benefits. Cultural barriers refer to the indifference that can characterise the behaviour of all people of all abilities (Gillovic et al., 2018) towards PwD. This barrier is manifest in factors such as the lack of respect for PwD parking slots. Relational barriers refer to the general population viewing PwD from a self-righteous perspective, believing that the PwD cannot live a full life, even within the constraints of the experienced impairments. Technological barriers refer to the speed of the technological change related to means of transport and communication, which can create difficult situations for those who do not keep up with the ongoing changes. Entrepreneurial myopia refers to the inability to appreciate the size and value of the tourism market for PwD and of changes occurring in public opinion. This myopia is in tension with the ideals of sustainability provided by Agenda 2030 (United Nations, 2015), which explicitly highlights the need to promote sustainability and inclusivity and to empower PwD (e.g. points 11 and 23 of Agenda 2030) and by the Global Code of Ethics for Tourism (UNWTO, 2001), which states the \u201cright to tourism\u201d (article 7). When accessible tourism experiences are designed, it is important to avoid ad-hoc solutions aimed exclusively at PwD (Scheyvens and Biddulph, 2018). Following the principles of universal design (Michopoulou et al., 2020), tourism providers should in fact enable experiences that are useable by all people, with or without disabilities. This approach is consistent with the idea that tourism carries a value that makes it a public service, interpreted as a service that should be assured for every member of communities that desire such services. The question now arises of the assessment of the potential of digital ecosystems to remove the identified barriers and enable effective accessible tourism experience co-creation. While it is clear that technology cannot solve all the problems, we contend that it represents a valuable engine for such effective co-creation. As noted by Akaka and Vargo (2014), technology should be conceived as an operant resource able to bring about changes in ecosystems and influence value co-creation processes. The provision of a platform to support the engagement of actors involved in accessible tourism can thus represent a first step to first removing informational and relational barriers, and over time, smoothening other barriers (e.g. cultural barriers). Thus, technology can enable the emergence of a digital ecosystem with tourists and their needs as the focal actors (Gretzel et al., 2015, 2016). Such an ecosystem could initially organise and coordinate suitable solutions to emerging PwD needs and issues by collecting and sharing the information concerning all the actors of the ecosystem. Given that tourism is a service provided by a specific territory, the digital ecosystem should be led by the authorities in charge at the territorial level, whether a municipality, province, region or country. Given that the emerging ecosystems require rapid efficiency and effectiveness checks, it seems more appropriate that the process begins at the local territorial level and then extended (through imitation and adaptations) to higher levels. Beyond authorities in charge at the territorial level, universities and other research institutes should play a central role in the design of a tourism ecosystem. These institutions should establish a dialogue with tourists, with PwD and with disability organisations and associations, without overlooking local inhabitants who are important for creating a warm and smooth welcoming. The emergence of the tourism ecosystem also draws on the constructive contributions of all the organisations representing the service providers who play a role in co-creating tourism experiences. The digital ecosystem should also be based on a series of incentives for firms that decide to be a part of the ecosystem, beyond a process of certification and evaluation of their delivered quality. As a good starting point, municipalities could establish tourism departments that have the additional responsibility for the removal of mobility barriers. The viability of this choice is demonstrated by the experience of Verona, the first (and currently the only) municipality in Italy that has introduced such a department. For smaller municipalities, the digital ecosystem could be created at a higher level, such as in a consortium of municipalities, a province or a region. Figure 2 presents the main features of the tourism digital ecosystem. Overall, the establishment of a digital ecosystem aims to make the territory an inclusive, warm and welcoming location where people want to live or stay. Hence, by providing an engagement platform, technology can act as an operant resource, disrupting the myopia guiding each actor's individual behaviours. An example of a digital ecosystem to support accessible tourism is the one being implemented by Explora, the destination management organisation of the Lombardy region (Italy). Explora has begun to establish a digital ecosystem (Ecosistema Digitale Turistico della Lombardia) through a platform that aims to support information sharing amongst the actors of Lombardy's tourism ecosystem. This ecosystem has not been created specifically to support accessible tourism. However, through this platform, operators could coordinate and harmonise the design of accessible tourism experiences, which would then be communicated and sold through the related web portal \u201cin-lombardia.it\u201d. This web portal currently hosts dozens of accessible tourism experiences; however, these are not conceived following the concept of the holistic ecosystem described in this paper. Nonetheless, the technological infrastructure that has been created has the ability to foster the future emergence of such a holistic accessible tourism ecosystem."}, {"title": "Universal Design Guide for Inclusive Tourism by Scott and Sarah Pruett", "article": "\u201cInclusive tourism is a global movement to ensure the full social participation of all persons with disabilities in travel, citizenships, and cultural contribution \u2013 and in the process, to ensure the same for everyone else.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Scott Rains , srains@oco.net www.RollingRains.com For more on the Pruetts see: Universal Design Partners https://universaldesign.org/"}, {"title": "Tourism Accessibility for Impaired", "article": "\u201cI have a wife and three children.

And these travelers represent, according to the Amadeus Accessibility Study, a \"$70 billion market\" just in Europe and the USA.\nThis fact alone would make a strong business case for investing time, effort, and resources needed to become more accessible and inclusive as a business and as an industry. But beyond the economic imperative, there are important reasons for the tourism industry to take this segment seriously.\nBelow are some ideas and insights on how and why we should promote not just accessibility, but also inclusive tourism that benefits everyone as well as relevant industry resources for tourism businesses and destinations seeking to better understand accessible and inclusive tourism, and to improve their practices. Parts of the content featured here have been inspired by and based on Martin's presentation (originally recorded on July 18th, 2019 as part of the GSTC Sustainable Tourism Training Online Course).\nTourism for All: Including As Many Different Groups As Possible\nContrary to what many might think, accessible tourism is not just about providing facilities that are wheel-chair accessible.\nSenior travelers. Parents traveling with small kids. Travelers with allergies and other medical conditions. These are all different types of travelers who have different degrees of accessibility restrictions and mobility requirements.\nAnd a large proportion of travelers with disabilities have \"invisible\" impairments (such as cognitive or mental health conditions and long-term illnesses) that may not be, unlike wheelchair users, immediately obvious just by looking at them.\nWhen planning for and communicating about the accessibility features and services you provide, therefore, rather than simply using the \"handicap symbol\" (the ubiquitously used sign of a wheelchair user - the top-left pictogram on the above image), these various areas of accessibility needs must be considered and appropriately indicated.\nShare on your website and brochures, for example, if you provide assistive listening devices on your tour, or if sign language interpretation is available within any of the attractions you visit.\n\"Tourism for All\" is a concept that is addressing a growing segment of travelers with a diverse range of needs and requirements. What is \"accessible\" to one traveler who is a wheelchair user, for example, may be very difficult to access or completely inaccessible to another traveler with a different type of disability, mobility impairment or other conditions.\nThat's why becoming more inclusive is a more appropriate goal for the tourism industry than focusing just on \"accessible tourism\" (which can be vague and hard to define - accessible for whom?).\nAn inclusive tourism business or destination works to offer positive travel experiences to people with different needs by addressing them from various perspectives, and by providing design and service solutions that aim to cover as many different groups as possible.\nUniversal Design: Designing for Everyone, Being a Good Host\nWhen it comes to being inclusive and promoting Tourism for All, a key concept that underlies the solutions to be implement by tourism businesses and destinations is Universal Design.\nThe definition of Universal Design is as follows:\nUniversal Design is the design and composition of an environment so that it can be accessed, understood and used to the greatest extent possible by all people regardless of their age, size, ability or disability. An environment (or any building, product, or service in that environment) should be designed to meet the needs of all people who wish to use it. This is not a special requirement, for the benefit of only a minority of the population. It is a fundamental condition of good design. If an environment is accessible, usable, convenient and a pleasure to use, everyone benefits.\n- Centre for Excellence in Universal Design, \" What is Universal Design\nTo understand where you need to improve in order to offer universally accessible experience for everyone's benefit, take some time to reflect on the whole customer journey from the perspectives of guests with different access needs and mobility requirements.\nThink about how they experience travel - from the customer finding your business, to booking their trip, to arriving in your destination, to getting around during their stay.\nAre there steps to enter the restaurant that will make it difficult for customers with limited mobility? Does your hotel offer an accessible and easy-to-follow process for guests with disabilities to check in/out and get around within the property? And is your website designed for users with different needs (e.g. individuals with hearing or vision impairment)?\nBusinesses often have barriers that make it difficult for customers with particular access or mobility impairments to enjoy a certain product or service, because of the lack of awareness that those barriers exist.\nAnd in some cases, businesses may be \"rejecting\" prospective customers without ever knowing. The 2016 Click-Away Pound study found that \"71% of customers with access needs will click away from a website that they find difficult to use\".\nWith all the different types of accessibility requirements, it may seem difficult or impossible to anticipate and accommodate the various needs of your customers. But it's important to remember that in tourism we are in the business of providing services to welcome guests; and that it is in fact your responsibility as a host to cater to the needs of your guests and to make them feel welcome.\nIt's part of being a good host.\nBy considering the diverse needs and abilities of all throughout the design process, universal design creates products, services and environments that meet peoples' needs. Simply put, universal design is good design. - Centre for Excellence in Universal Design, \"What is Universal Design\"\nInclusive Growth and Sustainable Development\nWith the growing importance of the accessible tourism market, and especially the spending power of this market segment including the \"multiplier effect\" (each traveler with impairment is likely to influence the purchase decisions of multiple members of their party), there is a strong economic imperative to be considered. To remain competitive, your tourism business and destination should be investing in universal design and inclusive solutions.\nBeyond the economic imperative, however, there are also key reasons why inclustive tourism should be part of the global sustainable tourism agenda.\nWith an estimated 15% of the world population living with some forms of disabilities (World Health Organization, World Report on Disability 2011), and the changing demographic of the \"rapidly ageing\" populations around the world (WHO, Aging and Life Course), sustainable development can only be achieved through an inclusive approach to creating solutions and opportunities.\nThe United Nations' \"Disability and Development Report: Realizing the Sustainable Development Goals by, for and with persons with disabilities\" (2018) recognizes that \"striving to achieve disability-inclusive development is not only the right thing to do, it is also the practical thing to do,\" as \"the success of the 2030 Agenda requires a participatory and inclusive approach in which all stakeholders, including persons with disabilities, are engaged.\"\nAnd that's why Tourism for All is highlighted in the Global Sustainable Tourism Criteria, the baseline standard for sustainability in travel and tourism.\nSource: Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC)\nAnd in the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO)'s Global Code of Ethics for Tourism.\nSource: UNWTO, Global Code of Ethics for Tourism\nInclusion in the Work Place\nHaving understood the importance of striving for universal design and working towards becoming more inclusive, what can tourism businesses do to get started? What are some of the first steps?\nOne of the key challenges when considering steps to becoming more inclusive is to understand the diverse needs of your customers and your prospective customers. The barriers that prevent some people from having a positive travel experience - whether they may be steps that cannot be climbed, signs that cannot be read, or buttons that cannot be reached - are hard to notice unless you put yourself in the position of those with particular disabilities and impairments.\nOne of the most effective ways for businesses to understand the various accessibility needs of their customers is to have team members who know and represent the perspectives of those customers. In short, hire people with disabilities. Empower them to help make your business more inclusive, both within your operations and through your products and services.\nThe UNWTO report \"Recommendations on Accessible Tourism\" (2013) states that \"the staff of tourism establishments and related services should be prepared to know, understand and address the needs of customers with disabilities\", and \"the staff should include employees who know how to communicate with persons with sensory disabilities.\"\n\"The hospitality industry serves travellers from all over the world. The diversity of cultures implies a diversity of customer expectations as well. The hotels with a diverse workforce to cater to such a wide customer base hold a strong competitive advantage over others. ...

This means that the room is designed while thinking about the needs of this kind of client so that they can move around in the room comfortably.\nIn some countries, like the United States, hotels are obligated to have a certain percentage of their rooms be accessible, across different floors and for different room types. This means that these rooms that are created for people with disabilities are required to include roll-in showers, toilets with bars on the sides, wide entryways to accommodate wheelchair maneuvering and other elements that we will discuss in more detail below.\nEight elements that accessible hotel rooms must include\nWhile there are many types of disabilities, as a hotelier, it is your responsibility to create an inclusive hotel that is welcoming to all individuals no matter their degree or kind of disability. This can be done by creating smart rooms that help use technology to make rooms more accessible with elements like voice technology. We will look at some of the key elements that these types of rooms must include so that they can be hospitable for all guests.\nVoice technology is an excellent tool to contribute to accessibility because this way your guests can control light switches, put on music or the television, and use the virtual concierge services activated by voice. Read more about voice technology. For those who are hearing impaired, you can implement smart mirrors and other smart technology with these kinds of guests in mind.\n1. Spacious and clutter-free\nSpaciousness is essential to provide adequate space for people in wheelchairs to move around the room freely. This also means that there shouldn\u2019t be any obstacles in their way like carpets or elements wheelchairs could get stuck on. Ideally, for better traction, the rooms should have hardwood floors. The same goes for the visually impaired, there shouldn\u2019t be any obstacles that might get in their way from moving around the room comfortably.\nThe best way to avoid possible hurdles is to have a room that is clutter-free with a simple layout, and minimal furniture to make it as easy as possible to navigate around the room.\n2. Automatic doors\nAutomatic doors are essential, especially for individuals in a wheelchair. There should be an automatic door when entering and exiting the room, and ideally, a power door assist as hotel room doors tend to be very heavy. When possible, automatic doors should also be in the entry to your hotel so that people can easily enter and exit the hotel without help. Learn more about lobby design.\n3. Adjustable beds\nWhether your guests need a hoyer lift or not to get into bed, it\u2019s important to have a bed with an adjustable height that can accommodate any kind of guest. This will also mean that you have the dimensions and height of the bed documented, so your staff is able to answer these important questions. Knowing this height, guests can more easily understand if they will be able to lift themselves into the bed or will need assistance.\nYou may also like:\n4. Roll-in shower and bars\nA roll-in shower means that the shower should be quite spacious without any steps or obstacles in the way, so people in wheelchairs can get in and out of the shower without any problems. The shower should also have a bench and bars in the shower and next to the toilet. The bathroom should have a panic button installed should they need help.\n5. Buzzer and light\nA buzzer and light are necessary for guests who are hearing impaired. The buzzer should be placed outside and a flashing light inside so that they know someone is at the door. The buzzer is also helpful for the visually impaired because they can hear when someone is at the door.\n6. Plugs\nWhile plugs should never be an obstacle for guests with disabilities, it\u2019s important that they are able to easily utilize the plugs, which should ideally be located between 15-48 inches (30-120 cm). The idea is to have the plugs more or less at waist height so that they can be easily reached. There should also be plugs on the desks, on the night stands and in the lamp bases.\n7. Suite set-up\nAs a hotelier it\u2019s important to have different types of rooms be accessible, that means that also suites are set up for people with disabilities, since they often travel with caregivers. These caregivers should be easily able to access the main room, but both parties should have privacy.\n8. Ability to remove items when necessary\nAs a hotelier you want your rooms to be decorated to perfection, However, in the case of accessible rooms, it\u2019s important that this decoration be flexible. That means that furniture can be easily moved or removed in order to accommodate your guests\u2019 needs. Excessive design elements that may get in the way, on the other hand, should be given extra thought if they really contribute or detract from the room\u2019s accessibility features.\nConclusion\nBy implementing these eight tips to make an accessible hotel room, you can be sure that your rooms will create an optimal guest experience by considering the needs of all your hotel guests. Make sure your front desk staff is trained on the different features of your accessible rooms so that they are prepared to answer any questions that come at them. Learn more about building the perfect hotel staff.\nYour staff should also be prepared to provide reasonable accommodations for guests with disabilities, like removing or moving furniture around, or relocating elements within the room to more accessible positions. The key to designing an accessible hotel room is a simple layout, minimal furniture, spaciousness and the ability to provide flexibility."}, {"title": null, "article": null}, {"title": null, "article": null}, {"title": "How to Find the Best Hotels for Wheelchair Users", "article": "Whenever we travel \u2014 even to visit family \u2014 we have to stay in a hotel.

That's despite the fact that adults with disabilities spent $58.7 billion in 2018 and 2019 on travel, according to a survey by the Open Doors Organization, a nonprofit that works to improve the quality of life for people with disabilities.\nIf you use a wheelchair or travel with someone who does, follow these tips to manage some of the common difficulties encountered at hotels.\nPlan and reserve\nA small fraction of hotel rooms are designed for guests who have disabilities. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) mandates that hotels with 151 to 200 guest rooms have six accessible rooms, and only two must include a roll-in shower (a shower that is typically larger with a zero barrier threshold, a handheld shower sprayer and a bench so the wheelchair user can transfer and sit while bathing). Hotels with 50 or fewer rooms are not required to have any roll-in showers.\nBill Sears, a 62-year-old retiree in Baltimore, spent 80 days driving solo across America and parts of Canada in 2019. Sears can't walk or stand and uses a manual wheelchair. Before beginning his journey, he secured reservations for wheelchair-accessible guest rooms with roll-in showers at 36 hotels.\nSears says he knew that hotels at national parks fill up fast, so he made his reservations there a year in advance. For other hotels along his route, he booked two to three months before his arrival date.\nKnowing your choices are limited, always make reservations as far in advance as possible \u2014 especially if you are visiting during peak tourist season or for a major event."}, {"title": null, "article": null}, {"title": "TSA Cares: What to expect when traveling with a mobility aid", "article": "Are you or someone you know traveling using a wheelchair or mobility aid?

The safe and efficient transport of mobility aids was identified as a key area for improvement by airlines, working with industry stakeholders and disability groups.\n\u201cAirlines are committed to ensuring passengers with disabilities can travel with dignity, confidence, and comfort. Working with representatives from the disability community, we established that new protocols to improve the transport of mobility aids were urgently required. This new guidance, created in partnership with key players in the travel chain, will improve service, and significantly reduce damage to these vital devices that are often an extension to the body of a passenger with a disability,\u201d said Nick Careen, IATA\u2019s Senior Vice President for Operations, Safety and Security.\nKey elements of the new guidance include:\nBetter processes for booking and information exchange, including the use of Special Service Request (SSR) and Passenger Name Requirement (PNR) codes to give advance information on the specifications of mobility aids.\nA recommendation to create an electronic mobility aid tag, fixed to the mobility aid and containing technical information which will help airlines and ground handlers transport the aid safely.\nAdvice to airlines on developing a communications toolkit for engaging with passengers with disabilities, including a clearly signposted and accessible website area.\nBest practices for loading, collection and return of mobility aids.\nA recommendation for dedicated specialized ramp personnel to be trained and deployed to handle mobility aids.\nGuidance for how to properly resolve instances where mobility aids are damaged.\nRevised and enhanced training of ground handlers and airline staff.\n\u201cExperience shows that communication is key to improving the handling of mobility aids. This guidance sets out steps for passengers, airlines, and the travel chain to exchange information at every stage of the travel journey. It will help airlines perform better and give passengers using mobility aids greater confidence. We\u2019ll be working with our members and stakeholders to operationalize this guidance, and the industry will be reaching out to policymakers to encourage harmonization with national regulations,\u201d said Careen.\nThe guidance reflects and builds on industry best practices and will continue to be revised and expanded prior to developing into industry standards. Other aspects include recommendations for airport designs to meet accessibility standards, as well as specific guidance to ensure compliance with the Dangerous Goods Regulations (for lithium-battery powered devices), in addition to step-by-step instructions on safely and securely loading mobility aids on board.\nAccess IATA Guidance on the Transport of Mobility Aids\nCredit | iStock"}, {"title": "Why Accessibility is Essential for Air Travel", "article": "Making air travel accessible to older travelers and people with disabilities is ultimately about being inclusive. It is about enabling everyone to enjoy the freedom that air travel offers. Approximately one in five people in the United States, or 64 million, have a disability and more than 10% of the population in the EU suffer from reduced mobility \u2013 mainly the disabled and the elderly.\nThe world\u2019s population is aging as virtually every country in the world is experiencing growth in the number and proportion of older persons in their population. As a result, IATA and its member airlines are committed to ensuring that all passengers can enjoy the freedom offered by air travel, no matter their abilities or limitations. This is not only the right thing to do for our passengers, it is also good for business. Passengers with disabilities will represent a growing segment. For instance, the total number of wheelchair requests in 2017 was approximately 15 million, a 30% increase on 2016.\nWhy is providing better access to individuals with disabilities important for the air transport industry?\nSafe and dignified travel for all passengers, including those with disabilities, is an airline commitment in addition, for the air transport industry it's not just because it is \"the right thing to do\" it also makes business sense.\nIATA member airlines have an inherent motivation to ensure that all people with accessibility needs have a positive experience when traveling by air. These people are customers-and are a growing segment of the population. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that more than one billion people live with some form of disability, which constitutes approximately 15% of the world's population.\nAirlines commit to improve travel for passengers with disabilities\nTherefore in 2019, the IATA Annual General Meeting (AGM) unanimously adopted a landmark industry resolution which re-affirmed the commitment of IATA member airlines to provide safe, reliable and dignified travel for people with disabilities. At the center of IATA's developement of its guiding principles and all its work on accessibility since, is the disability community's own guiding principle of \"Nothing For Us, Without Us.\" At every stage of the development of airline accessibility policy and operating standards, the disability community is involved and listened to. This is of course the only way to keep the focus on disability, accessibility and inclusion-particularly when facing a new reality and new measures due to a pandemic.\nChanging the focus from disability to accessibility and inclusion is allowing the travel sector to bring together passengers with disabilities and governments. Harmonizing regulations and processes and providing the clarity and global consistency that passengers expect.\nInterview with Linda Ristagno, IATA's AD External Affairs on Air Transport Accessibility\nAirlines launch global action group to improve handling of disability mobility aids\nIn July 2021, IATA announced the launch of a global Mobility Aids Action Group to examine and improve the transport journey of mobility aids, including wheelchairs, with the objective of improving the handling of this vital equipment for travelers with disabilities.\nThe Action Group is the first of its kind aimed at tackling issues around the safe and secure transport of mobility aids\u2014an issue of huge importance to a growing number of travelers. It also provides advice and recommendations to airlines and other stakeholders concerning the establishment of policy, process and standards related to the handling and transport of mobility aids.\nUniquely, the Mobility Aids Action Group involves the full range of stakeholders impacted by this issue, including accessibility organizations (representing travelers with disabilities), airlines, ground service providers, airports and mobility aids manufacturers. It is the first time a mobility aids manufacturer will be invited to participate in an IATA task force. \u201cAs airlines are just one link in the chain in the handling of mobility aids, it is essential we bring all players together to develop solutions. What\u2019s more, we are excited to invite a mobility aids manufacturer to the table. We think this is critical so all stakeholders can work together to take steps to improve the transport journey of mobility aids,\u201d said Willie Walsh, Director General of IATA.\nWheelchair damage or loss during air transportation\nWhile the industry has had standards for persons traveling with disabilities for some time there are still gaps. Damage to mobility aids has been an area that has been identified as a key topic to address from the disability community.\nAirlines have made efforts to improve, but damage or loss is still occurring. And when it does, it is highly distressing to the passenger as these devices are more than equipment\u2014they are extensions of their body and essential to their independence.\nTravelers with mobility aids face risks to their health and safety if their wheelchair or mobility equipment is lost, damaged or destroyed, as replacements are not always provided, and if provided, are not always suitable for the person\u2019s needs.\nThe loss or damage of wheelchairs or other mobility equipment takes away the independence of the traveler and affects every aspect of their daily lives until the matter is resolved appropriately.\nA recent survey from Able Move identified that among those who actively continue to fly, 55% say the biggest single cause of concern when flying was the fear of their wheelchair being damaged or lost.\n\u201cEvery year, thousands of wheelchairs are transported safely by air. However, damage or loss is still occurring. And when it does, it is devastating to the passenger as these devices are more than equipment\u2014they are extensions of their body and essential to their independence. We acknowledge that we are not where we want to be on this as an industry. This is why we want to do something about it on a global level, not through setting up a talking shop, but by bringing the key groups together to take practical action,\u201d said Willie Walsh, Director General of IATA.\nImproved access for passengers with disabilities in the industry restart\nAs airlines rebuild, the industry is eager to build a more inclusive restart. Despite the COVID-19 crisis, the IATA and its member airlines have worked with the accessibility community to move the priority of accessible air travel forward through a number of efforts. These are includeded in the latest Airport Handling Manual (AHM).\nWhat to consider for passengers' with disabilities air travel journey\nTo the extent possible, airline and other stakeholders should strive to ensure that passengers with disabilities maintain their independence and dignity. This is accomplished through adequate airport infrastructure, appropriate training, timely and customer-oriented services, as well as making use of technological solutions that can be leveraged to provided passengers with disabilities with choice and freedom to travel on their own terms. You can find detailed guidelines which can help your operations in section 176 of the AHM.\nPre-Travel: Passenger information, booking and ticketing\nCommunicating assistance needs in advance of travel is recommended and, in some cases, required to fulfill specialized requests. This allows airlines, airports and third-party service providers to be better prepared to assist passengers with disabilities throughout their travel itinerary, making the journey easier and the travel experience more seamless and enjoyable.\nAt the airport\nThe sole responsibility to provide assistance to passengers with disabilities throughout the airport is not limited to the airlines; depending on national regulations, airports may be responsible for providing assistance to passengers with disabilities directly, or via third-party service providers.\nAs not all passenger processes at an airport fall under the airlines\u2019 responsibility (i.e. security screening, exit immigration, customs, etc.) airlines need to work collaboratively with airports, regulators and other stakeholders in order to provide a safe and satisfying travel experience to all passengers.\nCheck-in\nAll available check-in methods such as via airline websites, mobile apps, self-service kiosks should be accessible to passengers with disabilities. In addition, airline agents involved in the check-in process should be trained to ensure that adequate assistance is provided. Passengers with disabilities should also always be offered assistance with carry-on and checked baggage.\nMobility device handling\nThe safe transport of a passenger\u2019s with disability personal mobility device is a critical operation for any airline as the wheelchair or scooter is an extension of the passenger and should be treated as such. Other mobility aids such as walkers and canes provide passengers struggling with mobility much-needed stability and support to safely walk and should also be handled with great care. As general guidance, the transportation of passenger battery-powered devices must be compliant with DGR subsection 2.3.\nBoarding and disembarking\nBoarding the aircraft can be a stressful experience for passengers with disabilities. Airlines should ensure that any requests made in advance are properly noted and any last-minute requests are handled efficiently and with care. Assistance must be provided as necessary, in addition airlines and airports should coordinate to make available at all stations wheelchairs and other mobility devices for boarding/disembarking within airport facilities, before departure, during intermediate stops and on arrival. Upon arrival, airlines should make best efforts to accommodate the passengers with disabilities, procedures will vary by terminal and gate configuration in terms of boarding bridge, etc. Therefore, all staff should be properly trained to provide: adequate mobility transfer techniques and prompt delivery of mobility devices. More details can be found in the Airport Handling Manual (AHM).\nWhat are the benefits of following the IATA guidance found in the AHM?\nPutting into practice the IATA guidance, airlines, airports and other industry stakeholders will:\nEfficiently serve passengers with disabilities by using IATA standards and best practices\nEfficiently communicate with passengers with disabilities before and during their travel experience\nEnsure available measures are applied consistently\nIdentify good practices in passenger assistance during disruptions and irregular operations\nHow can I get the Airport Handling Manual (AHM)?\nYou can order the latest edition of the AHM here."}]
