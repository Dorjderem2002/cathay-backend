[{"title": "6 Tour Companies Dedicated to Travelers with Disabilities", "article": "Growing up, Neha Arora didn\u2019t have the easiest time traveling with her family\u2014her father is visually impaired and her mother is a wheelchair user. \u201cWe\u2019d travel 2,000 miles only to realize the place wasn\u2019t accessible or wouldn\u2019t give us the experience we were looking forward to,\u201d says Arora. In 2016, she founded Planet Abled, a travel company that caters to the needs of people with various disabilities, a group the World Health Organization estimates at 15 percent of the world\u2019s population. Arora isn\u2019t the only one pushing for more thoughtful travel experiences\u2014here\u2019s a look at six companies focused on accessible travel.\nTravel for All\nTravel for All has organized more than 5,000 vacations around the world for travelers with a variety of requirements, including cane users, slow walkers, hearing and vision impaired persons, travelers with complex health issues like dialysis and developmental disabilities, and wheelchair users. \u201cAs multiple sclerosis began to affect my own personal travel, I researched what resources could assist me with executing travel using my wheelchair,\u201d says CEO Tarita Davenock. \u201cI was shocked when I saw the lack of services.\u201d Every trip Travel for All plans comes with an accessibility specialist. \u201cWe research and give our clients the pros and cons of any area in the world before planning the trip, so our client knows what to expect while they are in that destination,\u201d says Davenock. \u201cMeticulous planning and great attention to detail are the keystones of keeping our vacations safe.\u201d\nA Seable group trip in Cambodia, where travelers visited the Wat Phnom temple Courtesy Seable Holidays\nSeable Holidays\nSeable Holidays specializes in trips for visually impaired travelers. All trips include trained chaperones\u2014who undergo a background check\u2014as well as inclusive sports and sensory activities like horse riding, scuba diving, kayaking, wine tasting, yoga, and tactile museum excursions. And everything is thoroughly vetted, with chaperones, activities, and accommodations tested by blind people before they\u2019re recommended by the company. While trips are on pause during the pandemic, Seable Holidays will bring them back in summer 2022.\nEasy Access Travel\nDebra Kerper and her team at Easy Access Travel accommodate most types of physical disabilities in their solo trips and mixed group tours. While Kerper sometimes relies on her own experiences as a traveler in a wheelchair, she says every trip needs to be tailored to an individual client\u2019s needs. To do so, the team spends time getting to know their clients to match them with the best vacation choice, and visits hotels and tourist spots for inspection, takes cruises beforehand, and collects information from trustworthy sources to ensure a safe, accessible, and fun experience.\nPlanet Abled\nNeha Arora\u2019s Planet Abled arranges customized tours for people with different types of disabilities, and also plans group tours that include non-disabled people. Their trips mostly take place in India and South East Asia, with plans to expand to countries in Europe, and popular activities include river rafting, skiing, trekking, and wildlife safaris. Some of their extra touches include assigning a travel buddy for the blind, seeking special permission from museums so clients can touch and feel the articles on display, and arranging for sign language interpreters for the hearing impaired.\nWheel the World\nAlvaro Silberstein, the CEO of Wheel the World, was paralyzed from the chest down after surviving an accident at 18. This didn\u2019t stop him from seeing the world\u2014he\u2019s since visited 30 countries on five continents. \u201cI realized that people with disabilities should be able to explore places as anyone else,\u201d he says. Most of his clients are adults or seniors with mobility disabilities and wheelchair users, and he can arrange solo travel or group trips. Silberstein wants to create more awareness around accessibility, and his company pays special attention to details like the height of beds, width of doors, and accessibility of bathrooms, compiling this information on the Wheel the World website. Their multi-day trips are designed with local tour operators with a focus on accessible travel, and includes access to adaptive bikes, beach wheelchairs, and equipment for hiking, skydiving, kayaking, scuba diving, and surfing\u2014they\u2019ve even planned Macchu Pichu trips for wheelchair users. The company makes sure \u201cprices are competitive and the pricing is the same no matter if the clients have a disability or not,\u201d says Silberstein.\nA quiet moment in Sintra, Portugal Courtesy Tapooz Travel/Aicha Nystrom\nTapooz Travel\nLaurent Roffe and Aicha Nystrom spent years volunteering with an organization that provides outdoors excursions to people with disabilities. \u201cWe have many friends in wheelchairs as part of our close community,\u201d says Roffe. \u201cI\u2019m a sea kayak guide and [Aicha] is a ski guide and this has always been a source of immense joy for us. Launching our accessible travel business was a natural extension of what we are and what we like to do.\u201d Their company, Tapooz Travel, specializes in trips for those with mobility issues, including visual and hearing impairment, rather than cognitive disabilities. When they have a client with a visual or hearing impairment, they make sure there\u2019s at least one guide trained in sign language, or have a guide who can help with things like reading the menu at the restaurant and providing a voice narration during a site visit. Their network also includes adaptive sports instructors, sailboat skippers, tribal elders, massage therapists, and hot air balloon operators, all of whom are trained to work with travelers with disabilities."}, {"title": null, "article": null}, {"title": "Accessible Tourism", "article": "Accessible Tourism\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO, 2023), \u00a8an estimated 1.3 billion people - about 16% of the global population - currently experience significant disability\u00a8.

These recommendations aim to guide the decision-makers of natural resources in tourism in undertaking accessibility improvements. The document has a particular focus on facilitating access to protected areas, beaches and parks. The WCPA Tourism and Protected Areas Specialist Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT), acted as the expert reviewers. Their involvement was key in identifying the best actions geared towards a greater extent of accessibility and inclusiveness within nature areas, vis a vis tourism. The guidance tool, whose drafting was led by UNWTO, the ONCE Foundation and UNE, is part of the promotion of ISO Standard 21902:2021. Download here the guidelines in English and Spanish.\nRecommendations for cultural tourism key players on accessibility UNWTO, Fundaci\u00f3n ONCE and UNE issued in September 2023, a set of guidelines targeting key players of the cultural tourism ecosystem, who wish to make their offerings more accessible.\nThe key partners in the drafting and expert review process were the ICOMOS International Cultural Tourism Committee and the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT). The ICOMOS experts\u2019 input was key in covering crucial action areas where accessibility needs to be put in the spotlight, in order to make cultural experiences more inclusive for all people.\nThis guidance tool is also framed within the promotion of the ISO Standard ISO 21902, in whose development UNWTO had one of the leading roles. Download here the English and Spanish version of the Recommendations.\nNew user-friendly guides for destinations to implement accessibility standards On the occasion of the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, UNWTO, ONCE Foundation and the Spanish Association for Standardization have launched, in December 2022, a user-guide targeting public administrations and tourism destinations to implement ISO Standard 21902:2021. This is a key tool to understand specific actions that can be undertaken by a wide range of organizations entrusted with designing policies, strategies and destination marketing plans in the sphere of accessible tourism.

Just as other guidelines on the UNWTO series, this document will be revised in 2021 with relevant accessibility partners.\nReopening Tourism for Travellers with Disabilities:\nHow to Provide Safety Without Imposing Unnecessary Obstacles In partnership with the ONCE Foundation of Spain and the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT), UNWTO suggested in July 2020 a set of practical steps to ensure accessibility for all, under the new circumstances. \u201cReopening Tourism for Travellers with Disabilities\u201d provides recommendations for destinations and service providers to accommodate customers with disabilities and specific access requirements, including seniors.\nAccessible Tourism Destination The \"Accessible Tourism Destination\" was launched in 2019 by UNWTO and the ONCE Foundation, to recognize and promote accessible tourism destinations. The ATD is an annual UNWTO distinction based on an Expert Committee evaluation, which acknowledges destinations enabling a seamless experience to any tourist, regardless of their abilities. The first ATD was awarded in 2019 and has been temporarily put on hold, given the pandemic.\nVideo \"Change your destination\" The video \u201cChange your destination\u201d was issued by Fundaci\u00f3n ONCE and UNWTO by the occasion of the 2019 International Fair of Tourism (FITUR). Facilitating travel for people with disabilities is an exceptional business opportunity. Yet, a change in mind-set and in the model of tourism services provision is needed in order to meet this major market demand. Accessible environments and services contribute to improve the quality of the tourism product and can create more job opportunities for people with disabilities. Accessibility, therefore, must be an intrinsic part of any responsible and sustainable tourism policy and strategy.\nWorld Tourism Day 2016: \"Tourism for All - promoting universal accessibility\" To mark the celebration of the World Tourism Day 2016 under the theme \"Tourism for All - promoting universal accessibility\" UNWTO, the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT) and the Spanish ONCE Foundation for the Social Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities have produced a compilation of Good Practices in the Accessible Tourism Supply Chain. While these examples provide a small sample of possible solutions regarding accessibility, they will hopefully inspire others to take steps towards broadening the availability of accessible offers in tourism destinations around the world.

Ensuring that the information is accessible, is without any doubt a key to communicating successfully with visitors in all stages of their journey, particularly with regards to travelers with disabilities and special needs. The UNWTO Recommendations on Accessible Information in Tourism have been developed with the support and collaboration of the ONCE Foundation for Cooperation and Social Inclusion of People with Disabilities and the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT). They were adopted by the Resolution A/RES/669(XXI) of the General Assembly of UNWTO as a follow-up to the \u2018Recommendations on Accessible Tourism for All\u2019 of 2013.

The Recommendations incorporate the most relevant aspects of the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities of 2006 and the principles of Universal Design. In the context of a trilateral agreement between UNWTO, ONCE and ENAT, the recommendations were adopted by UNWTO General Assembly Resolution A/RES/637(XX) of August 2013, updating the 2005 UNWTO Recommendations.

The manuals are meant to assist tourism stakeholders in improving the accessibility of tourism destinations, facilities and services worldwide.\nHighlights of the 1st UNWTO Conference on Accessible Tourism in Europe In recognition of accessibility\u2019s importance in the tourism sector, UNWTO and the Government of San Marino jointly organized the 1st UNWTO Conference on Accessible Tourism in Europe (19 - 20 November 2014). Drawing together policy makers, tourism destinations, the private sector and civil society, this landmark event addressed challenges in advancing quality, sustainability and competitiveness within the tourism sector through universal accessibility. This publication features 14 good practices presented at the Conference which focus on accessibility of cultural heritage sites, policy frameworks and strategic actions to make accessible tourism a reality.

Well, yes and no\u2026\nThere\u2019s been a lot of talk about \u201caccessible travel\u201d lately \u2013 especially since the UNWTO designated World Tourism Day to Tourism for All in 2016. But what exactly is it, and why is it so important?\nThe easy answer is that a billion people (that\u2019s 15% of the world\u2019s population), lives with some sort of disability, and ensuring equal access to travel is simply the right thing to do. In fact, the first human rights treaty of the 21st century was the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and Article 30 specifically calls for States Parties to ensure that people with disabilities enjoy the benefits of tourism \u2013 which will be all too familiar to any reader of this article.\nBut accessibility is so much more than \u201cmerely\u201d a human rights issue. In fact, tourism professionals are increasingly realising that it offers an economic opportunity by tapping into a market that is neither niche nor small. It\u2019s a misconception that people with a disability don\u2019t travel. We do. Our travel aspirations are very similar to the general population and, although it\u2019s true that the unemployment rate for people with a disability is higher than that for the general population, many of us have jobs and disposable income. South African Tourism\u2019s powerful commercial, featuring a blind tourist, shows how a disabled traveller is actually no different from any other traveller.\nA number of studies, in particular one by VisitEngland, have shown that the value of the so-called Purple Pound is already large and, importantly, that it\u2019s growing as a proportion of the overall tourism spend. A recent study for Tourism Australia found that the accessible travel market is already larger than the much-vaunted Chinese inbound market and is growing more quickly! What these studies have also underlined is the \u201cmultiplier effect\u201d: people, especially those with a disability, don\u2019t travel alone. For example, I travel with my wife and three children, so if a venue isn\u2019t accessible for me as a wheelchair user, it loses the revenue from not one, but five people.\nFIND OUT MORE ABOUT WHAT INTREPID ARE DOING TO MAKE TRAVEL ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYONE HERE\nBut with an ageing population in developed countries, it\u2019s fast becoming a social and economic imperative to provide accessible infrastructure, when already one in five people in the US and Australia are living with disability. Rightly or wrongly, the market driver of this segment is actually not people who identify as disabled, but the 40% of people who retire with an acquired disability \u2013 a figure that rises to 56% at age 70 and 70% at age 80. Currently, this is the retiring Baby Boomer population \u2013 possibly the first generation in human history that won\u2019t be passing on its wealth to its offspring, but instead feels it has earned the right to enjoy a retirement that is lasting longer and longer and, in most cases, involves travel.\nForward-thinking destination management organisations \u2013 such as VisitEngland, Visit Flanders, the German National Tourist Board and Catalonia \u2013 have already invested significant resources into developing tourism experiences and information portals to enable people with access issues to plan their trips more easily. And their marketing strategies \u2013 and, importantly, choice of imagery \u2013 are specifically targeting an ageing demographic. To ensure their business remains sustainable, tourism service providers are also increasingly looking to offer accessible travel experiences to cater to this demographic.\nRELATED: MEET THE FAMILY TRAVELLING THE WORLD WITH THREE KIDS (AND A WHEELCHAIR)\nIn Australia, and much of the world, we use the term \u201caccessible travel\u201d. But by emphasising access (and with most people equating \u201cdisability\u201d with \u201cwheelchair users\u201d), the stress is immediately put on compliance \u2013 the costly business of installing ramps and accessible toilets \u2013 rather than the opportunity to differentiate and capitalise on a large and growing market. In fact, wheelchair users make up less than 10% of the disabled population. People with vision or hearing impairments outnumber wheelchair users, and people with invisible disabilities \u2013 including those living with long-term illness and severe allergies such as coeliac disease \u2013 represent up to 75% of the disabled population. Even when considering people with a mobility impairment, there are up to four times more people who don\u2019t use a wheelchair than do. Think of your parents or grandparents, who might not use a cane, but still need a hand rail when negotiating stairs and really appreciate the occasional bench for a rest when wandering around parks and gardens. So when we talk about this travel \u201csegment\u201d, it would be so much better if we used the term \u201cinclusive travel\u201d to put the emphasis on making sure experiences are able to be enjoyed by the widest possible number of people, instead of making them accessible to a relatively small number of wheelchair users.\nLooking at it this way means there are countless small changes that businesses of all sizes could make that would benefit a wide range of travellers with access needs: assistance dog toileting areas and water bowls; TVs with a captioning option; clear passageways with good colour contrast and signage; large-print black-and-white information materials (ask anyone over 55 about reading fancy menus in dimly lit restaurants\u2026); easy-to-read fonts such as Arial or Helvetica in signage or information materials; hearing loops; telephones that are compatible with hearing aids; vibrating pillow alarms; lowered counters or an occasional table in front of reception to welcome wheelchair-using guests or people of short stature; blocks to adjust the height of beds or tables; making sure cooking and cleaning practices cater for people with food allergies or chemical intolerances\u2026 the list goes on.\nRELATED: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND TRAVEL WITH A HEARING IMPAIRMENT\nAnd let\u2019s not forget the value of a website that\u2019s accessible for people with disabilities, particularly the vision-impaired (Intrepid Travel are working towards having their website accessible to more people \u2013 by aiming for AA Level of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines \u2013 by the end of 2020). Because here\u2019s the thing: the greater one\u2019s access needs, the greater the need for planning using detailed and accurate information. But, ironically, relevant and reliable information regarding accessibility is hard to come by; it\u2019s often either missing or hidden away under FAQs.\nWhat are Intrepid doing to accommodate travellers with disabilities?\nTara Kennaway, who heads up Accessible Travel in Intrepid\u2019s Product team, had this to say. \u201cWe know that travellers with disabilities are increasingly looking beyond specialised disability tour operators and want to travel in an authentic, exploratory way with their family, friends and other like-minded people. We still have plenty of work to do to make our trips more accessible and to be able to share our style of exploring the world with as many people as possible. It\u2019s been fantastic to see the engagement of our staff around the globe in this topic, from our sales teams responding to enquiries from travellers with disabilities, our local operators auditing our trips in country, and our group leaders delivering amazing experiences and customer service to our travellers.\u201d\nIn order to travel independently, trustworthy information is the key and that\u2019s Lonely Planet\u2019s reason for being: to help travellers to get the best out of their trip by providing the information they need to make informed decisions. We have made a modest start by producing access guides to different destinations. Our Accessible Rio de Janeiro guide was supplied to the International Paralympic Committee for visiting athletes; the IPC have already signed up for an Accessible Tokyo guide for the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics. We have exciting plans for this guide as we look to partner with new technology partner What3Words, an innovative navigational mobile app, to get people with a disability exactly where they need to be.\nSUBSCRIBE TO INTREPID\u2019S NEWSLETTER FOR TRAVEL TIPS, COMPETITIONS, GIVEAWAYS & MORE\nI have also curated the world\u2019s largest collection of online resources for travelling with access needs: Accessible Travel Online Resources, which was recognised by the UNWTO in 2016 as one of a handful of examples of best practice in accessible tourism and is now vastly expanded in the current third edition. Lonely Planet\u2019s Accessible Travel Phrasebook contains some 100 words and phrases to assist disabled travellers to make their needs known in 35 languages.\nLonely Planet also publish online articles by disabled travel bloggers (including yours truly) and regularly share and promote the cause to our huge social media following, leveraging our authority in a positive way, in the hope that this will create a knock-on effect. Judging by a recent survey of followers, in which 43% told us they want it to hear more about accessible travel, it looks as though we\u2019re on the right track.\nIntrepid is committed to making travel widely accessible, regardless of ability or disability. If joining a group trip is not practical we may be able to provide you with a private departure. Please contact our sales team for further information on any of our itineraries.\nAll images C/O Martin Heng."}, {"title": null, "article": null}, {"title": "The world\u2019s most wheelchair-accessible travel destinations", "article": "At Lonely Planet, we believe that travel should be for all, and that accessible travel information is vital to making that possible. And with one billion people in the world living with a disability, the more resources there are for travelers with disabilities, the better.\nIn partnership with KAYAK.com, we\u2019ve rounded up the top wheelchair-accessible destinations around the world. Consider these spots for your future travel plans.\nHow KAYAK.com can help you find accessible accommodations\nKAYAK.com's search features can help travelers with disabilities find accommodations that meet their needs. To find accessible hotels, first search for hotels in your destination, and then check the \u201cIncreased accessibility\u201d box in the \u201cAmenities\u201d filters on the left-hand side of the page. This filter reveals properties that offer these features: wheelchair accessible, facilities for disabled guests, in-room accessibility, accessible rooms, facilities for disabled guests, and disabled access.\nPlaya del Carmen, Mexico\nOne hour from Canc\u00fan International Airport, Playa Del Carmen is a far cry from its more revelrous neighbor, yet still has accessible hotels and an accessible beach furnished with beach wheelchairs. There\u2019s even adaptive equipment to allow you to go snorkeling to enjoy the coral reef and green turtles. But the main reason for coming here is to visit the nearby and largely wheelchair-accessible Mayan archaeological sites, Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 and Tulum, a rare chance for the mobility-impaired to get up close to ancient ruins.\nSan Diego skyline from the harbor \u00a9 David Toussaint / Getty Images\nSan Diego, California, USA\nWith the Americans with Disabilities Act having just celebrated its 30th anniversary, much of the USA\u2019s infrastructure is accessible, but our pick is San Diego. Laid out along the classic grid system, generally flat and with a fully accessible trolley system, it also boasts a balmy year-round 64-80\u00b0F climate.\nThe historic Gaslamp Quarter is very wheelchair friendly, as is the massive Balboa Park (incorporating the slightly hilly San Diego Zoo), but it\u2019s the miles of beachfront promenade with beach wheelchairs available \u2013 including a motorized one with caterpillar tracks at Mission Beach! \u2013 that are the main attraction.\nBarcelona, Spain\nWith the national tourism authority and Catalonia in particular pushing accessible travel, it\u2019s no surprise that wheelchair users have been flocking to Barcelona. With 80% of the metro stations and 100% of buses wheelchair-accessible, as well as a relatively flat and cobblestone-free old city, getting around is a breeze.\nWhat\u2019s more, wheelchair users not only jump to the front of the queue for attractions such as the breathtaking Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, they often get in for free! You can explore the length of La Rambla and get around the famous Mercat de la Boqueria; even the beach has wheelchair access and people on hand to help.\nWelcome to Las Vegas \u00a9 Michael Phillips / Getty Images\nLas Vegas, Nevada, USA\nLas Vegas is undoubtedly one of the most accessible cities for people with disabilities in the US. Of course, the casinos and the venues hosting world-renowned musicians and shows are all wheelchair accessible, as are the vast majority of sites and attractions, many of which \u2013 like the Fountains of Bellagio and the Fremont Street Experience \u2013 are completely free.\nMore surprising, perhaps, the High Roller \u2013 the tallest observation wheel in the world, which takes 30 minutes to do a full revolution \u2013 is also wheelchair-accessible. And if you\u2019re after an adrenaline rush, wheelchair users can even enjoy the SlotZilla Zip Line and the Zoomline, which reach speeds of up to 35 miles an hour, or a hot-air balloon ride over the city.\nAdd to this a very wide choice in accessible accommodation, easy exploration along the wide sidewalks of the Strip, a fully accessible bus service that serves all parts of the city, and plenty of wheelchair-accessible taxis and you can begin to understand why Las Vegas has become something of a destination for wheelchair users.\nManchester, UK\nAlthough it was the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, much of central Manchester was rebuilt in the late 1990s, making smooth, wide, step-free pavements, as well as stepless entry into shops, restaurants and bars the norm \u2013 ideal for anyone with mobility requirements.\nNorthern England\u2019s cultural hub is well served by accessible public transport, leaving you free to pay homage at Old Trafford, learn about our industrial roots at the Museum of Science and Industry or shop with the goths at Affleck\u2019s. And if you\u2019ve had enough of the city, the Peak District National Park, with well-developed facilities for visitors with disabilities, is less than an hour away.\nA piazza in Taormina, Sicily \u00a9 Matt Munro / Lonely Planet\nSicily, Italy\nItaly might not spring to mind as a very accessible destination due to its narrow, often cobblestone streets. But there are a number of tour operators that cater to travelers with disabilities. Motor-impaired travelers can enjoy scuba diving, 4WD off-road driving, traditional Sicilian fishing and olive oil making \u2013 not to mention the gastronomic delights normally associated with Italy. Indeed, two Guinness world records have been set here: first paraplegic to dive to 59m and first blind woman to dive to 41m!\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania, USA\nAs one of the oldest cities in the US, you might not expect Philadelphia to be very accessible \u2013 but it is! While the Old Town may offer some challenges for wheelchair users, sidewalks are generally well maintained in the more touristed areas, with plenty of curb cuts and tactile markings.\nThis is particularly useful for wheelchair users considering most of the city\u2019s attractions are within a two-mile radius of the City Hall. The subway, opened in 1907, is only partially wheelchair-accessible, as is the overland rail network, but unfortunately the aging trolley system is not. However, the city\u2019s fleet of more than 1000 buses are all low-floor and wheelchair-accessible, as is the PHLASH tourist bus which runs a continuous loop downtown, stopping at many popular attractions, and costs only $5 for an all-day pass.\nNeedless to say, all of the city\u2019s most popular attractions \u2013 including Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell, Love Park and the Philadelphia Museum of Art \u2013 are fully wheelchair-accessible despite their antiquity. And when it comes to finding accommodations, there are plenty of wheelchair-friendly options right in the center of the action.\nSandridge Bridge in Melbourne, Australia \u00a9 Catherine Sutherland / Lonely Planet\nMelbourne, Australia\nWith its highly accessible public transport system and compact city center, Melbourne is one of the most accessible cities in the world. Visit the sporting capital of Australia armed with Lonely Planet\u2019s accessibility guide, Accessible Melbourne, a free e-book that includes the most up-to-date advice for travelers with special needs. Discover Melbourne\u2019s best wheelchair-friendly restaurants, enjoy spectacular scenery along the Great Ocean Road, and visit one of the world\u2019s best zoos as well as many of the parks that progressive Parks Victoria is opening up to visitors with access needs.\nLjubljana, Slovenia\nSlovenia\u2019s flat and largely pedestrianized capital, served by accessible electric vehicles, is well worth a visit. Most of its buses are accessible, but the city is so small, with plenty of ramps and curb cuts, you might rarely need them.\nThe city\u2019s main drawcard, the 16th-century Ljubljana Castle is reached via a funicular (free for people with disabilities and a companion) or train, both wheelchair-accessible. Many of Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik\u2019s famous bridges have recently been made accessible, and were joined in 2010 by the award-winning Butchers\u2019 Bridge, which allows wheelchair users access to boats.\nSingapore has established accessibility requirements into its city code \u00a9 Ninnat Fongsupa / 500px\nSingapore\nSingapore has to be the most accessible city in Asia and one of the most accessible cities in the world. Its universal code on barrier-free accessibility, in place for decades, plus increasing affluence have resulted in an infrastructure with stepless access to most buildings and no shortage of curb cuts.\nAlthough power wheelchair-friendly taxis aren\u2019t common, the accessibility of the mass rail transit (MRT) and buses makes them unnecessary. In Singapore, the question is not \u201cwhat is accessible?\u201d but rather \u201cwhat isn\u2019t?\u201d \u2013 from its street food hawker centers to its marvelous zoo.\nVienna, Austria\nLike many European cities, Vienna is steeped in history, being the center of the former Habsburg Empire and the musical heart of Europe. Unlike many of its counterparts, however, its cobblestones have been removed, as have many of the curbs.\nThe refurbished city is both flat and compact, with most central shops and cafes fully accessible. Getting around is relatively easy with elevators to the metro and plenty of low-floor trams. Most museums and places of interest are fully accessible, including the must-see Schloss Sch\u00f6nbrunn.\nYou might also like:\nTake a spin around the globe with an accessible travel expert\nWhat I have learned from travelling the world with a wheelchair"}, {"title": "Travellers with disabilities", "article": "Disabilities do not have to make travel impossible. Most high-income nations have implemented strict requirements for accessibility by law in recent decades, and the US legislation on that topic even served as a model for a UN agreement. That being said, some places \u2013 whether through carelessness or lack of resources or historical restrictions \u2013 are rather hard to access for people with some disabilities. Common problems include sidewalks marred with potholes and or blocked by poles protruding at odd angles, which make walking a challenge even for the healthy and greatly inhibit mobility in a wheelchair, insufficient or non-existent public transit infrastructure, unthoughtful currency design, and needlessly noisy restaurants.\nBlind and visually impaired [ edit ]\nCrossing with tactile paving\nGetting in [ edit ]\nIn most parts of the world, airports and train stations are generally manageable places for a blind or visually impaired person with reasonable mobility skills, except for the navigation problems caused by fast-moving crowds. Plan extra time to get from one place to the other, and let the teeming hordes pass you by. For airport security, you'll need to know what you've put on the scanner to be X-rayed, and how to describe it when it comes out the other end. If they have a question about some of your hand luggage, then you won't be allowed to touch it to confirm that it's yours before they've double-checked it. So if a security officer vaguely asks someone in your direction, \"Is this yours?\", be ready to say that you brought a black wool jacket, a MacBook Air laptop, a black leather briefcase, and an iPhone in a silicone rubber case.\nThe quality of bus service varies much more, and your next stop after the plane or train may be the local bus or a hotel shuttle bus. Some cities have speaking buses, accessible apps that you can download to plan your route, and braille labels on the stop buttons. In other places, you have to rely on the driver to tell you what bus you're getting on, which direction it's going, and when it's your stop.\nIf you have some vision, then mark your luggage in a way that will let you identify it. There won't be too many people with their suitcases covered from edge to edge in a large X or other shape made with neon pink duct tape. If you need something that doesn't rely on vision, then consider a specialized electronic speaking device or a tactile pattern, perhaps made of knots in thin rope very securely wrapped around the handle.\nOnce you're there [ edit ]\nThere are a few hotels that specialize in blind and visually impaired guests. These hotels provide high-contrast features, talking elevator controls, room keys that make it easy to tell which end goes in first, and otherwise understand what makes your life simpler. However, the odds are that you'll be arriving at a typical hotel. In that case, tell the hotel about any requests you have when you make your reservation. Whenever possible, speak to the local hotel staff about their facility before reserving your room, rather than relying on a central call center. When you arrive, the check-in process will likely be the same as any other transaction, right down to the detail of needing to explain to the clerk how to position your signature card or asking him to use the top edge of your credit card to indicate the bottom edge of the signature line. Ask someone to walk you to your room, at least the first time, so that you can orient yourself, check for nearly invisible glass doors and other obstacles along your route, and also figure out the room key. Some hotels deliver a newspaper to each room in the morning. This tripping hazard can usually be stopped or held at the front desk for you upon request.\nIf you use any specialized computer tools, such as a screen reader or software for zooming, then bring your own laptop, braille notetaker, or other electronic devices. You almost certainly won't find what you want in an internet caf\u00e9. Ask hotel staff to point out where the electrical outlets and sockets for internet cables are located in the room.\nIf you're traveling for work, you may not have time to do much else. But if you are on holiday or otherwise expect to have some time, then consider your options. Ask the hotel staff for help finding your preferred form of transportation, as well as for general advice. If you're interested in your destination, try signing up for a guided tour, so that you can hear the tour guide describe the history and culture. Large history and art museums sometimes hold special hands-on tours for blind and visually impaired people. A gift shop that sells scale models of famous local buildings and monuments may let you touch them, so you can better understand the places you've just visited.\nYou may also be able to get useful advice about your destination from the local blindness institute at your destination.\nGuide dogs [ edit ]\nIn general, travel should be planned for well in advance when traveling internationally with a guide dog. As dogs can carry diseases, special testing, vaccination and paperwork is required in many countries, especially island countries. Countries with such requirements include the UK and Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Sweden, Norway, and Finland. The US state of Hawaii has very similar requirements, which are more strict than those in use on the US mainland.\nMany countries allow guide dogs where dogs are not normally allowed (e.g., inside a restaurant, on public transit), while most developing countries don't have laws permitting guide dogs in public places, and locals may not distinguish the difference between pet dogs and guide dogs, causing troubles when entering places where pet dogs are forbidden.\nDeaf and hard of hearing [ edit ]\nSome fire alarms use flashing lights as well as sounds.\nTravellers who are deaf or hard of hearing (HOH) may benefit from some specific features, such as lights on fire alarms. If you can't hear fire alarms, then always tell the hotel staff about your hearing situation when you check in.\nAlmost all restaurants, especially in areas with significant international travel, can take orders from diners who merely point at what they want on the menu. An increasing number of casual restaurants allow ordering online for takeout or delivery, which reduces the risk of miscommunication.\nA few restaurants and stores have employees that use sign language. If you're traveling near a large school for deaf and HOH students, you are likely to find more establishments that are accustomed to patrons who can't hear well. For example, if you're near Washington, D.C., then it may be worth a trip across town to its Near Northeast district, to be near the businesses that cater to students and staff from the famous Gallaudet University.\nNoise is a problem in many restaurants, and it can affect everyone. Most restaurants will do their best to accommodate people who want to be able to hold a conversation, so it's worth asking if a quiet table is available. The makers of the SoundPrint app, which aims to crowd-source noise ratings for American restaurants, say that American Chinese and Indian restaurants tend to be less noisy than other types of restaurants in the US.\nMobility impaired [ edit ]\nWheelchair ramp to a shopping mall in Johor, Malaysia.\nInfrastructure for the mobility impaired varies widely. When considering destinations, looking at cities that have hosted the Olympics (and Paralympics) is a good starting point. Wheelchair ramps and accessibility are part of the preparation. Developed countries tend to have better infrastructure to support travellers with reduced mobility than developing countries. However, some public transit systems like the Paris Metro have poor accessible design, despite serving the capital of one of the wealthiest countries on Earth. Newly constructed infrastructure tends to keep accessibility in mind during the design phase while older infrastructure often do not.\nIn many developed countries some categories of establishments, including most public services, are required to be accessible by wheelchair. Even so, it may be good to call in advance, as the door to use may be a locked back door, or it may be temporarily blocked by roadworks.\nParking placards from your home country may be recognized in other countries.\nThe permits used for getting to use dedicated parking are partly standardised; a tag from a member country of the International Transport Forum should be valid in nearly all of Europe and North America and in a dozen countries elsewhere under the reciprocal recognition of parking badges resolution.\nDepending on your travel goals, your everyday access methods may not be the right choice. Even if you can usually get by without a wheelchair, jetlag and other fatiguing effects of travel, as well as a desire to keep up with the rest of your group, might make a wheelchair desirable some times. Most airports offer wheelchair service to disabled passengers, and many large attractions, such as amusement parks, keep a small number of wheelchairs and baby strollers on hand for use by patrons on the premises.\nEquipment for wheelchair users to enter and exit the water (Syros, Greece)\nAdditionally, a wheelchair that works well in your home area might not carry you over the terrain at your destination. Some people will find it cost-effective to buy a specialized chair, but many others will benefit from renting them. Powered trackchairs that can handle forest floors usually cost more than US$10,000, but they can be rented in some places for as little as $100. The rickshaw-styled single-wheel Jo\u00eblette wheelchairs are popular with hiking families all over Europe, and they can be rented in some public parks for a nominal fee. Wheelchairs with wide balloon tires to navigate sandy beaches often cost more than $1,000, but some beaches rent them at a low cost. These are generally manual chairs that require someone else to push the chair. Because this specialized equipment is key to seeing your destination, and because most parks only keep one chair on hand, contact your destination in advance to confirm that any advertised equipment is still available and in good working order, to make sure that it is suitable for your needs, and to ask whether it can be reserved in advance.\nSpecialized wheelchairs for travelers\nSingle-wheel rickshaw-style wheelchair for hiking, usually pulled by one person and pushed by another\nAll-terrain, powered, tracked wheelchair used for hunting\nBeach wheelchair with wide tires\nAutism [ edit ]\nA sunflower lanyard can be worn to signal hidden or invisible disabilities to trained transit staff.\nTravellers with autism (including Asperger\u2019s Syndrome) often feel overwhelmed by noise and general \"hustle and bustle\". Airports and trains often have a lot of noise. A pair of noise-cancelling headphones can muffle the sound, while a fidget spinner can be a distraction. Some airports have sensory areas or quiet rooms to provide a calming environment. Inquire ahead of time if a hotel offers autism-friendly rooms, which reduces the anxiety of travellers who are extra sensitive to the changes of the new surroundings while travelling.\nTravellers with autism are often vulnerable to scams, as they can find it more difficult to tell when someone is lying to them. Having a solid understanding of typical local crimes and scams, and practising how to respond to strangers, may help counter scams. The basic point is that you in this context should ignore most strangers who claim to need help and those who offer help you did not look for. If somebody needs help, some locals are better equipped to provide it.\nFatigue [ edit ]\nRegardless of whether your fatigue is caused by a sleep disorder, an autoimmune disease, heart disease, or something else, there are several strategies that can help you have a successful trip. The first is: whatever things really work for you at home, whether that's following a particular diet, only doing one \"big\" thing every other day, taking a nap each afternoon, or something else, don't leave those strategies at home.\nPlan ahead. This includes all of the usual travellers' plans, like where to eat and what sights to see, but also find out things like whether you need to make reservations in advance and whether they can be cancelled without penalty if you run out of energy. Consider travel insurance if you think the whole trip might need to be cancelled. If airplanes wear you out, plan for a day to recover when you get there. If you can recharge on a train or in a car, then you might be ready to go as soon as you arrive. When you are thinking about travel, think about all of it: the hour-long drive to the airport, the two hours in the airport, the four hours on the plane, the half-hour waiting for your checked luggage, and so forth. Have a plan for dealing with jetlag if you're changing time zones. Keep your plans flexible and not too crowded. It's better to plan to see one museum, and have some backup options in case you're having a particularly good day, than to plan to do three things, and feel disappointed that only two happened. Remember that the most memorable moments aren't usually the headline attractions, but instead are the unexpected, unplannable moments of joy. Visiting the Louvre may be a life goal, but you may remember other moments \u2013 a new favorite flavor of ice cream, the silence after a snow storm, that still-warm baguette, the ladybug on a child's finger \u2013 with more clarity later. Remember that you are not doing travel \"wrong\" if your plans involve relaxing in a comfortable spot instead of rushing back and forth between popular tourist activities. Be realistic about your energy and abilities, and factor that in to your plans. If your trip has one main goal in mind, such as an amusement park or a large museum, you might be able to save money by buying discounted end-of-day tickets or by getting a multi-day or annual pass. These may permit you to visit the destination for a couple of hours each day for the same cost as a few long and exhausting days.\nConsider the demands of your destination. If you don't fare well in the heat, then either pick a cooler time to visit or plan for ways to stay cool. Make sure that hotels, restaurants, and vehicles have air conditioning. If you need to be out in the heat, look into cooling vests and other specialized equipment. Layers of clothing, such as two thin T-shirts instead of one heavy one, can let you adjust to changing temperatures.\nPack everything you need, and nothing else. Make a list and check it twice, especially if your fatigue makes it difficult to remember a thousand little details. Depending on your destination and your needs, you might find it more convenient to ship some things to your destination in advance, or to rent it locally so that you have less luggage to bring with you. Keep medication, water, safe snacks, and any necessary equipment, such as a walking stick or a pillow, with you.\nTake advantage of services that are intended to help you. For example, call the airline or cruise line and arrange a wheelchair ride. If you can afford it, hire people to help you, such as a local tour guide or a driver. Can someone else wash the laundry or help with getting ready to leave or returning home?\nIf you're traveling with other people or if you are visiting friends and family at your destination, have a conversation well in advance, so that everyone has the same expectations about your energy budget. Tell them what's important to you and what you'd like them to do when you need to rest.\nRespect [ edit ]\nParking space for mobility impaired in Malaysia\nKeep the following in mind when travelling with or meeting a fellow traveller who happens to be disabled.\nIf you need to interact with a person with disabilities, then speak directly to that person, in the same manner that you would speak to any other stranger whom you would like to make a favorable impression on. For example, do not ask a blind man's children what he would like to do; ask him directly.\nDo not touch people with disabilities, or any of their equipment or other belongings, without getting their permission first. \"May I help you with that?\" is more polite than grabbing their things. Be prepared to have your offer of help declined.\nPeople all have varied interests, and once practicalities have been taken care of, a person's disability is seldom the most important thing in their life. Someone in a wheelchair may prefer to spend the day at a bird sanctuary rather than attend a wheelchair race, and a blind person might prefer discussing the local culture and history of a town rather than the absence of braille on the museum exhibits. Don't ask how or when they became disabled. This can be perceived in a rude way and they\u2019re probably bored with telling that story already. Do ask the same things that you would ask any non-disabled person, which includes small talk about your adventures with fellow travellers and requests for advice about local sights and restaurants from people who are familiar with your destination. Don't make jokes or say clever things. They have already heard all of them, from \"Don't run over me in that wheelchair\" to \"I sure wish I could board the plane first\", hundreds of times. These types of jokes are also considered very poor etiquette.\nThere is no need to talk loudly or slowly to blind people. They can hear you well enough.\nDo not pet, feed or otherwise distract a guide dog without first asking the owner's permission.\nThough ignorance, laziness and arrogance probably could be classified as disabilities, they are self-inflicted and do not qualify one to occupy a disabled parking space. These parking spaces are reserved to make it easier for someone in a wheelchair, or who uses crutches or a cane, to enter and exit a vehicle. At the same time, if you see someone walking from a disabled space alone with no apparent difficulty, don't jump to the conclusion that the person is not qualified to occupy the space. Disabled parking permits are often available to many people who don't use wheelchairs, but have other conditions that seriously limit their mobility (such as a leg amputation, certain cardiac or respiratory conditions, or chronic severe pain). The driver may also be going inside to pick up the person who is entitled to use the space, and assist that person in entering the vehicle.\nMost people rarely give a second thought to toilets because they are always there and easy to use, but for a person with mobility limitations, using a standard toilet can be very difficult or even impossible. Check on toilet facilities before planning an outing.\nCountries information [ edit ]\nWheelmap has information about wheelchair-accessible places in many countries. The information is rather basic with 3 levels: All rooms accessible, some rooms accessible, not accessible.\nLonely Planet created a free resource for finding accessibility information by country called Accessible Travel Online Resources (free PDF download through store).\nCanada [ edit ]\nIn Canada, legislation that regulates federal accessibility standards was passed in 2019, with varying grace periods. The regulation includes interprovincial bus routes, train service and airlines. For Ontario, the building codes, and rules for transportation and service providers to improve accessibility, will be fully enforced by 2025.\nThe European Union tries to set common accessibility standards, especially in new construction and public transit. Most bus operators and many train operators should be able to accommodate people in wheelchairs, though more rural stations may lack elevators and legacy platforms may not have the right height for current rolling stock.\nThe Euro banknotes and coins are intentionally designed to be easily recognizable by touch. While the ten cent coin is slightly smaller than the five cent coin, it is easily distinguished by its ridge. Similarly the fifty cent coin, while bigger than the one Euro coin, has a different ridge as well. Also, banknotes increase in size as the denomination increases.\nFinland [ edit ]\nGeneral awareness of accessibility issues is quite high, although in practice there are still many problems. Most public facilities and many private ones have arrangements for people with wheelchair or hearing aids. Anyhow it is a good idea to call in advance to check any special arrangements (such as entry by a locked back door) and have company that can help with unexpected problems.\nToilets designed for use with a wheelchair are common where there is more than one toilet. Public buildings and modern shopping centres should be fairly safe bets. Bus and railway stations also used to be, but since the 2000s they have all too often been closed or repurposed, even in big towns.\nService dogs are accepted also in shops where dogs in general are not allowed. Many traffic lights have audible signals. On buses there is usually a reserved seat behind the driver, but in practice that seat may not have space for the dog but in the aisle. Ask the driver (any fellow passenger can help with translation, if needed). Service dogs generally travel for free, also on the railways, where you should include them on your ticket (you might want to buy the ticket by phone or at a desk rather on the net, to have the personnel handle the booking interface).\nWhere finding a parking lot may be hard, there are often parking space reserved for people with disabilities. There is a special permit to use these parking lots. Foreign permits are recognized, given they have the international symbol.\nThe railways have wheelchair-accessible cars on most routes; sleeper cars each have one cabin for a person with disabilities and his or her assistant. Assistance can be ordered in advance, from the platform to your seat; conductors will help you on the train itself. If you have a personal assistant (any adult) travelling with you, he or she gets a free ticket, provided you are in wheelchair or have an accepted certificate. Call \u260f (domestic calls free) for details.\nLocal buses are usually equipped for wheelchair access (and using the buses is free at least in some cities, also for a person assisting). Coaches, on the other hand, usually cannot handle wheelchairs, other than by putting collapsible ones in the luggage compartment; you will need your own assistant to get to a seat.\nTaxis usually charge extra if you have a wheelchair or need significant assistance. On the other hand, the elderly and people with disabilities belong to their most important customer groups, so most drivers will be very helpful and professional.\nMets\u00e4hallitus (\"Forest Administration\"), which manages the national parks, gives information on accessibility for each destination, many of which have trails accessible by assisted or motorized wheelchair. Often, the trails are too steep to cope on your own in a normal wheelchair. The other trails are often too rough for people with even minor mobility impairment. The exhibitions and services at visitor centres are usually accessible.\nThere are specific regional SMS emergency numbers for those that cannot communicate by voice. These are not posted on the Internet. Enquiries to \u260f .\nJapan [ edit ]\nACCESSIBLE JAPAN offers information for tourists with disabilities and other mobility issues with sections including general information, a database of accessible hotels, tourist attraction reviews, equipment rentals and more. They have also published a tour guide book for Tokyo, Accessible Japan's Tokyo: All you need to know about traveling to Tokyo with a disability.\nHEART BARRIER gathers a database of wheelchair-accessible restaurants and shops all around Japan. They include details like slope width and slope, which are not included in Wheelmap.\nPeru [ edit ]\nWheelchair tours of Machu Picchu are available, as are accessible tours of the Inca Highlands. Apumayo Expediciones is the most established accessible tour operator in the area.\nSouth Africa [ edit ]\nSee also Disabled travel in South Africa\nUnited Kingdom [ edit ]\nThe gap between some platforms and the train doors is uncomfortably large even for people with no disabilities.\nAccessibility in the UK is generally good, although there are challenges. For example, train station platforms frequently do not align with the train doorway, sometimes by more than a foot (0.3 m). Assistance is available at most train stations, but you'll want to arrive in plenty of time to make arrangements.\nDeliberate discrimination against individuals with disabilities is prohibited in law, with many popular destinations and venues having gone considerably beyond the 'reasonable' adjustments required. For example, Bournemouth offers not only beach access through concrete ramps down to the beach, but also beach wheelchairs to rent, charging stations for electric scooters, and beachside elevators during the day. In the Yorkshire Dales, barriers have been removed on certain, mostly short, routes in the Miles without Stiles program, to create routes that have appropriate gradients and surfaces for people with mobility impairments.\nUnited States [ edit ]\nWhile the U.S. for the most part is very good at accommodating disabled travelers, one glaring exception is money for blind travelers. While coins can be distinguished relatively easily by touch, the physical sizes of the coins do not consistently relate to the value of the coin. Most notably, the dime (10 cents) is physically the smallest coin. The situation for paper currency (notes) is even worse for the blind. All denominations are the same physical size (unlike the euro, in which the notes increase in physical size as the denomination increases), and there are no tactile features that enable blind people to readily distinguish different denominations by feel. A redesign of each U.S. note that would include a tactile feature to better accommodate people who identify currency by touch has been delayed until 2028 at the earliest and probably several years later for the $20 bill, which is one of the most commonly used. In the meantime, the American Foundation for the Blind has published a guide detailing alternative ways to identify currency."}, {"title": "Planning an accessible trip?

Continued...\nWhat is Accessible Tourism?\nAccessible Tourism, as defined by Darcy and Dickson (2009, p34);\nAccessible tourism is the ongoing endeavor to ensure tourist destinations, products, and services are accessible to all people, regardless of their physical limitations, disabilities, or age.\nAccessible tourism encompasses publicly and privately owned tourist locations.\nAccessible tourism enables people with access requirements, including mobility, vision, hearing and cognitive dimensions of access, to function independently and with equity and dignity through the delivery of universally designed tourism products, services, and environments.\nThis definition is inclusive of all people, including those traveling with children in prams, people with disabilities and seniors.\nNoting the obstacles that persons with disabilities, or those with other access requirements, face in taking advantage of fundamental aspects of travel, senior United Nations (UN) officials urge policy-makers, travel planners and companies that work with persons with disabilities to work together to make travel more accessible.\nSpecific problems often encountered by the disabled tourist when trying to book a holiday, scenic tours, and accommodation can include:\nLack of well-adapted hotel rooms\nLack of accessible airport transfer\nLack of wheelchair accessible vehicles\nLack of accessible restaurants, bars, etc.\nInaccessible, or only partly accessible, websites\nLack of adapted toilets in restaurants and public places\nInaccessible streets (cars parking on the sidewalk, etc.)\nLack of professional staff capable of informing and advising about accessibility issues\nLack of disability equipment (wheelchairs, bath chairs, toilet raisers, electric scooters)\nLack of reliable information about a specific attraction's level of accessibility (church, castle, exhibition, etc.)\nDisability Travel Tips\nBicycle shops are great places for wheelchair replacement parts.\nLearn foreign vocabulary that can help you describe your situation and needs.\nConsider getting travel insurance. Make sure that it covers pre-existing conditions.\nBring plenty, even extra, of any medications that you take. Make sure that all medicines are allowed in the country you're visiting.\nLook for disability organizations or resources at your destination that can provide you with area-specific information as well as local contacts.\nIf you use an electric wheelchair, look into whether you'll need a plug adapter and a voltage converter. Or see whether you can rent a battery charger abroad. Have a contingency plan if power outages or voltage drops.\nHave a backup plan, including your accommodation. In case your reserved accessible room isn't available, bring along items such as a portable ramp, a shower chair and a reacher to grab items that may be beyond arm's length.\nKnow your rights. This is particularly important for airline travel, at the airport and on the plane. Familiarize yourself with applicable laws and airline regulations. Inform the airline of your situation and make assistance requests in advance.\nUnderstand cultural differences. You may get more, or less, attention in other countries than you would in the United States. Then again, Roth-Vinson says, you may stand out more as an American than as a wheelchair user or a blind person.\nMajor Airline Travel Tips for Travelers with Disabilities - Jessica Padykula - (2015-02-12)\nTips to Make Traveling with a Disability Easier - Helen Hecker - (2008-12-24)\nWheelchair Travel Tips - J.D. - (2010-07-01)\nSubtopics and Associated Subjects\nadvertisement"}, {"title": "8 of the world's most disability-friendly holiday destinations", "article": "Known for its innovative architecture, exciting food scene, vibrant culture, tangible history, and lively nightlife, Berlin is a fascinating blend of glamour and grit.\nAs the German capital, there\u2019s plenty to see and do here.

So get out your passport and join us as we explore the exciting world of inclusive travel!\nUnderstanding The Challenges Faced By People With Disabilities\nUnderstanding the difficulties that people with disabilities confront is essential before attempting to make travel experiences more accessible for them. Although it's a common misconception that places or activities are off-limits to people with impairments, this hypothesis has to be further examined. While there are unquestionably barriers and restrictions, it's vital to remember that those with disabilities can travel and have travel desires. We are better able to meet their needs and design inclusive experiences if we have a greater grasp of the particular difficulties they face. We can open the door for accessible transportation options for people with impairments by doing this.\nAccessible Transportation Options For Travelers With Disabilities\nMaking accessible transportation options available is crucial to enhancing the travel experiences of those with impairments. Making sure that people with disabilities have equal access to the opportunity to visit fascinating new locations and take in the landscape is necessary to achieve this. By offering accessible transportation choices, such as trains with ramps and lifts or wheelchair-accessible automobiles, we can remove obstacles and promote a more inviting travel experience. Signposts and clear directions can be installed in transportation hubs to help passengers navigate terminals with ease. We might also provide useful equipment, such as audio announcements and tactile maps, to enhance the whole travel experience for people with disabilities.\nTo properly appreciate the relevance of accessible transportation alternatives for individuals with disabilities, let's think of them as doors to opportunities that are just waiting to be opened. These options allow people to embark on exciting activities without worrying about accessibility limitations. Accessible transportation gives a path for exploration and discovery, opening up endless possibilities for people who may have previously felt constrained by physical limitations, much like a window allows us to see into other worlds outside of our immediate surroundings.\nAs we discuss how to make travel experiences more accessible for people with disabilities, it is critical to focus not only on transportation but also on choosing accommodations that promote accessibility.

As a cisgender heterosexual white male, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m acutely aware that I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t experienced the hurdles or prejudices others have when traveling to certain destinations.\nHowever, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen first-hand how travel connects people and bridges divides, and I want that experience for others. As a leader in the travel industry, I feel like it is my duty to ensure that everyone has a good experience, and that means helping every traveler feel safe and welcome on every trip.\nWorking with destination marketing organizations, I have learned how destinations can create safe, welcoming, and inclusive spaces for diverse travelers. Here are some ways destination marketers can support that vision.\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nIntegrate values that match up with the needs of diverse travelers.\u00c2\nJust like with other products, travelers are \u00e2\u0080\u009cshopping their values.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They want inclusive, accessible destinations where they know they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll feel safe and welcomed. According to a recent survey from Accenture, approximately three out of every five travelers want their travel providers to share similar diversity and inclusion values.\nWhen LGBTQ+ and ethnic minorities responded, that number increased to nearly three out of every four travelers. In today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s market, travelers are no longer willing to compromise their beliefs, which means destinations must prioritize diversity and inclusion to create the right reputation and win travel bookings.\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nEnsure authenticity for your destination through collaboration and accessibility.\u00c2\nDiversity and inclusion go well beyond marketing; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a way of life and a belief system that requires destination marketers to think about the messaging they're putting out and what kind of destination they want to be. You must become advocates for both your destination and the travelers you want to attract, and advocacy isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just about race or gender.\nIt also includes abilities, such as making places wheelchair accessible or safe for those with autism, and meeting the diverse needs of all travelers. Above all, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to be authentic. This level of grit, sweat, and passion goes way beyond a hollow tagline. Travelers will see through any attempts to woo them without substance.\u00c2\nOne of the best ways to be authentic is to have open-minded conversations and learn from travelers who are looking for inclusive destinations. Rather than making assumptions or boxing in travelers, speak directly to Black, Latino, Asian and LBGTQ+ travelers to find out what they really want and embrace who they are. Travelers everywhere want the same thing\u00e2\u0080\u0094to feel included, safe, and able to explore without prejudice.\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nConnect with travelers along their journey throughout your destination.\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the best way for you to put your best, most inclusive foot forward? First, learn which travelers are coming to your destination. You likely have diverse travelers visiting your destination, so find out who they are and what they want and find ways to accommodate and inspire them.\nFor example, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re attracting LGBTQ+ travelers, you could put on more LGBTQ+-friendly events, which will naturally encourage travelers to return and attract new travelers. The best way to do this is to band together. Embracing diversity is a collective effort, so work with hotels, restaurants, and attractions in your destination to ensure travelers will have the same inclusive experience wherever they go.\nIn addition to knowing your travelers and working together, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to have the right toolkit. For example, Destinations International is creating diversity and inclusion toolkits for destinations. Your website is the face of your destination and a huge part of your toolkit, so periodically review your content. Do you use inclusive language? Would a traveler feel safe and comfortable when visiting?\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nDestinations leading the charge in making travel accessible for all.\nA number of destinations are working diligently to ensure travelers from all backgrounds feel safe and accepted. New York City\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website is rich with options for all travelers, ranging from The Black Experience to halal-friendly options and AAPI leaders.\nBoston recently launched its All Inclusive campaign, offering insights into Boston\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cultural diversity and helping travelers understand their options for accessibility around the city.\nThis year, Cleveland celebrated Freedom Fest in honor of Juneteenth, while Baltimore continues to celebrate its diverse population. Regardless of the destination, there are so many incredible ways to showcase diverse populations and traditions while welcoming travelers from all backgrounds.\u00c2\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nEnsuring inclusive and accessible environments into the future.\nI am proud to be part of an industry that connects human beings and helps us realize we are all the same. Travel is the best weapon to break down ignorance and judgment barriers. It is inspirational to witness destination marketers leading the charge to promote diversity and inclusion and make travel accessible to all people.\nBy creating inclusive, safe environments, DMOs are positioned to lead the charge in making sure travelers can explore the world in which we live.\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d"}, {"title": "New Inclusive Travel Insights Report: Why Welcoming All Travelers Matters", "article": "Travel\u2014by its very nature\u2014promotes a greater understanding of people from different walks of life. Yet while the travel industry has made some strides toward becoming more inclusive, diverse, and accessible, there\u2019s still work to be done.\nExpedia Group\u2019s mission is to power global travel for everyone, everywhere. To help realize this vision, we started by looking inward to ensure that we are reflecting the diversity of our travelers and modeling the inclusive mindsets that make travel a force for good. We understand the importance of not only practicing inclusion, but also empowering our partners to do the same.\nThat\u2019s why we commissioned custom research to understand how consumers feel about inclusive travel, and how they believe the current travel landscape stacks up. Conducted with Wakefield Research, the study surveyed 11,000 representative consumers in 11 countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, the UK, and the U.S. Our findings are included in a new Inclusive Travel Insights Report to help your brand practice inclusion better, promote diversity, and provide equal access to all travelers. Below is a snapshot of the report.\nAccessibility and diversity in travel\nOne aspect of inclusion is ensuring equal access to all travelers. This is especially important as Baby Boomers are expected to be a growing traveler segment while also experiencing age-related health issues. Our research shows that 54% of this generation finds accessibility in travel is very important, 5% more than the general population.\nAs for diversity, our research shows that 7 in 10 consumers would choose a destination, lodging, or transportation option that is more inclusive to all types of travelers, even if it\u2019s more expensive. This means they are willing to spend more on travel that\u2019s truly inclusive.\nHotel advertising that can reach any traveler, anywhere Travelers looking to book a hotel use multiple channels to find their ideal place to stay, from social media to travel websites, and more. This is why it\u2019s imperative that you know when \u2014 and where \u2014 to reach the right traveler. Whether you\u2019re trying to reach early-bird or last-minute bookers, our targeting capabilities can help you connect with the right traveler at the right time. Connect with your target audience\nLocal culture and community in travel\nIt\u2019s also important for the travel industry to be inclusive of local cultures and communities, and for travelers to pay attention to their interactions with them. Indeed, our research shows that over 1 in 3 consumers are looking for information on ways to engage, recommendations for supporting indigenous cultures, and ways to spend time volunteering while traveling.\nIn fact, 74% would choose a travel option that supports local cultures and communities, even if it was more expensive.\nRepresentation in travel marketing\nClearly travel marketers have an opportunity to do better, to help all travelers and destination communities feel represented. This is important not only because it\u2019s the right thing to do, but also because it\u2019s better for business.\nAccording to our research, 78% of survey respondents said they have made a travel choice based on promotions or ads they felt represented them through messaging or visuals. For Millennials that figure is even higher \u2013 84% have made a travel choice based on representation in travel advertising.\nExamples of inclusive travel marketing campaigns\nSo what does representation in marketing look like? Here are a couple examples of partners that worked with us to help share their commitment to inclusion in their travel advertising.\nVisit Panam\u00e1\u2019s \u201cThe Next Turn\u201d Features Blind Adventurer\nOur research shows that 92% of consumers think it\u2019s important for travel providers to meet the accessibility needs of all travelers. But travel shoppers may not know if a destination they are considering can accommodate them.\nThat\u2019s why Visit Panam\u00e1 partnered with Expedia Group Media Solutions and our award-winning creative team on a new video series called \u201cThe Next Turn\u201d to promote the destination. One episode features Amar, a blind traveler, who experiences a rainforest, volcano hike, and coffee farm in Panam\u00e1 through his sense of hearing, smell, taste, and touch. This campaign showcases how travelers with different abilities can immerse themselves in the amazing experiences Panam\u00e1 offers.\nTourism Malaysia Promotes Local Culture\nAnother way to practice inclusion is to respect local cultures and help improve the livelihoods of host communities.\nTourism Malaysia knows this, which is why it worked with us to create a Travel Spotlight landing page. The Spotlight shows travelers how they can experience Malaysian culture by visiting historical sites such as Georgetown, Penang, a UNESCO World Heritage site and home to one of the largest collections of pre-war buildings in Southeast Asia; or by observing a different way of life in Sarawak, which has traditional longhouses housing communities of up to 100 families; or by visiting the indigenous communities of Kadazan and Dusuns, where visitors can shop an array of traditional handicrafts.\nHow your brand can be more inclusive\nWhen traveler shoppers feel understood and embraced, they\u2019re more likely to book. So how can your brand be more inclusive? First, travel marketers can draw from our Inclusion & Diversity in Travel Advertising guidelines, which documents best practices on delivering marketing campaigns that represent and cater to all people."}, {"title": "Curated Travel Experiences", "article": "What our members are saying\n\"The experiences on the trip, especially the cruise, were among the best of any trip we have taken with Inspirato.

According to the UNWTO, the gains were led in part by a 9 percent increase in international arrivals in Africa.\nAt a time when so many booming industries are technologies, tourism has become a powerful people-driven economic force, and with that power comes a massive responsibility. In many parts of the world, inequality is widening and wealth increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few. Tourism\u2019s potential for inclusivity presents an opportunity to distribute the economics of a booming global industry more broadly, to communities and people who not only have not benefited from tourism before but may face limited options for building better livelihoods for themselves and their families.\nOur upcoming Africa Travel Summit reminds us of how critically important it is that we get the tourism opportunity right. If done well, the benefits will stay within the communities in which the travel occurs\u2014distinguishing travel from many other industries that have found riches in Africa and exported them elsewhere. For us at Airbnb, the two-day summit will be a chance to hear and learn from some of the continent\u2019s most visionary entrepreneurs in travel and technology. The Summit is part of our $1 million commitment, announced in 2017, to expand tourism in Africa in ways that are local, authentic, sustainable, geographically diverse and yes, demographically inclusive\u2014what we call \u201chealthy tourism.\u201d\nTo help our broader community beyond Africa engage with the Travel Summit, Airbnb will showcase the work of African content creators, highlight African destinations and celebrate African hosts on our global social media channels for the week.\nAlso this month, you can join us in following Jessica Nabongo, who is now nearly 70 percent of the way toward becoming the first black woman to visit all 195 countries and states in the world.

We\u2019re also sponsoring 25 students as they attend the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute\u2019s Leadership Conference in Washington, DC, a gathering designed to empower young Latinx to take on issues affecting the US Latinx community.\nThis month also brings the second anniversary of Airbnb\u2019s anti-discrimination report, issued on September 8, 2016 as our first step\u2014of what we know will be many\u2014toward eliminating bias wherever possible from our platform. At Airbnb, we are committed to fighting bias through inclusion. Our ability to provide guests with an inclusive travel experience can only start with Airbnb being an inclusive travel company, looking internally and externally for opportunities to champion diversity and rid the platform of potential discrimination. We also believe that inclusiveness is self-perpetuating. As our CEO and Head of Community Brian Chesky often observes, when we travel and experience new surroundings and cultures, we realize people are 99-percent the same.\nAmong the many other initiatives we launched in releasing the report was Instant Book, an opt-in feature for hosts that reduces the potential for bias by allowing any guest to book a listing without securing prior host approval. While we have much more work to do here, I am pleased to report that two years after we launched the feature, Airbnb now offers 3 million listings, 60 percent of our inventory, that are instantly bookable.\nWe also recently took a step toward fulfilling our commitment to diversifying our senior leadership by appointing our first woman board member, Ann Mather, an incredible leader from Pixar and Disney and current board member of both Pixar and Alphabet. Ann joins former American Express Chairman Ken Chenault as our second independent board member.

Published At 01/01/2010 What is \"Accessible Tourism\"?\nThere is no single, universally accepted definition of \"accessible tourism\". Here we refer to some of the ways in which the term is defined and used. The concept is certain to evolve as it is applied in more and more contexts around the world.\n- \u201cAccessible Tourism\u201d (also known as \u201cAccess Tourism\u201d, \u201cUniversal Tourism\u201d, \u201cInclusive Tourism\u201d and in some countries such as in Japan \u201cBarrier-free Tourism\u201d) is tourism and travel that is accessible to all people, with disabilities or not, including those with mobility, hearing, sight, cognitive, or intellectual and psychosocial disabilities, older persons and those with temporary disabilities\" (Takayama Declaration - Appendix, UNESCAP, 2009).\n- \" 'Accessible Tourism' refers to tourism that caters to the needs of a full range of consumers including persons with disabilities, older persons and cross-generational families. It entails removal of attitudinal and institutional barriers in society, and encompasses accessibility in the physical environment, in transportation, information and communications and other facilities and services. It encompasses publicly and privately owned tourist locations.\" (Takayama City and UNESCAP Conference - Press Release - Takayama, 2009)\n- \"Accessible tourism is the ongoing endeavour to ensure tourist destinations, products and services are accessible to all people, regardless of their physical limitations, disabilities or age. It encompasses publicly and privately owned tourist locations. The improvements not only benefit those with permanent physical disabilities, but also parents with small children, elderly travellers, people with temporary injuries such as a broken leg, as well as their travel companions.\" (Accessible Tourism on Wikipedia - downloaded 1 January 2010).\n- ...a process of enabling people with disabilities and seniors to function independently and with equity and dignity through the delivery of universal tourism products, services and environments.

And there is the problem. Almost everybody thinks they know what it means but, since it has never been fully defined, almost everybody has invented their own personal definition. That is a recipe for disaster. If travellers and the industry have no common language, then imagine how frequent disappointment and disputes will become? If hotel owners and construction teams have no way to describe the solutions they want designed and built, then how likely is either side to be satisfied with the result?

Certain sustainable development is ambiguous ground but in the tourism activities it is very pressing for the negative impacts of the classical tourism model.\nThese assumptions are useful to analyze the costs and benefits of inclusive tourism, thanks to the pyramid of accessibility. This study will in fact make it possible to determine, on the basis of the resources present in the territory, the opportunities and limits of this type of tourism.\nIn European destinations, above all, in Italy, the openness to inclusive tourism can constitute a new cycle of tourism product such as to activate that interest and curiosity that drives tourists to visit the destination. This chapter describes at first the criteria for the planning of tourism for all, and finally, in the second part, it will deal with the international policies for the realization of tourism for all.\nThe traditional model of tourist destination is characterized by tourist attractions and related infrastructure, often avoiding the local people. The resort or tourist villages are born to entertain tourists, but they did not involve local people. Nowadays the tourism and the resorts are changing, and so a lot of destinations are involving a new idea of tourism with the accomplishment of the local people that can support the persons with specials needs to live an independent travel as inhabitans.\nIt is therefore necessary to look for new models in tourism that can create a dialogue, peace and fruitful encounter between guests and the local community. This involvement, in fact, can be activated directly or indirectly \u2013 with or without the presence of the local community in all activities of tours \u2013 but always in accordance with the need of each other. Tourism for all is a new idea but is the future of tourism for different reasons: the first is that the needs of people, especially those with differences or disabilities, are increased in all parts of the world and they required the solution immediately and tailor-made; the second consists in the hypothesis that if guests can have more economic and especially technological potential, they can support and transfer their know-how to all those who suffer from that particular disorder, providing this benefit; and the third gives sustainability using the appropriate resources to enhance tourist activities.\nIn this new vision, the World Tourism Organization has attributed to tourism for all a broader vision than accessible tourism alone, combining sustainable and social tourism in a single form of tourism, including every person regardless of gender or other forms of diversity.\nIn the innovative strategy of inclusive tourism, it should be pointed out that destinations will have to develop plans and appropriate policies for sustainability and accessibility. This form of tourism, which certainly has social aims, could also be conflicting if, for example, accessibility makes use of very invasive technologies or not too much in line with the efficiency and protection of the environment. Tourism for all, therefore, becomes an ambitious project to be implemented at the local level to create a model, so valid to the global level."}, {"title": null, "article": null}, {"title": "Search strategies in accessible tourism, barrier-free tourism, disabled tourism and easy access tourism literature", "article": "Research concerning the inclusion of individuals with disabilities in tourism activities began long before this field of study was formally named.

That vision can be a reality with the help of ISO 21902, which facilitates enjoyment of travel by people of all ages and abilities \u2013 making tourism accessible to everyone.\nA study suggests that accessible tourism is a significant emerging market, expected to generate revenues of EUR 88.6 billion by 2025. The standard helps tourism service providers promote tourist-friendly destinations for the disabled and realize the opportunities this lucrative market has to offer. Whether you are an expectant mom, a senior citizen or a person with a disability, you have the same right as everybody else to enjoy life through barrier-free tourism. The impact of this standard even goes beyond the tourist beneficiaries \u2013 it embeds accessibility into the social and economic values of society.\nSustainability will continue to be a priority for hotels in 2022 and beyond.\nKeeping culinary traditions alive\nFood is everything that we are. It\u2019s an extension of our ethnic identities, not to mention our personal histories. One of the best ways to fully experience a country\u2019s local culture is to have a taste of its unique cuisine, which is why it\u2019s so important that we preserve it the right way.\nISO 21621 outlines requirements and recommendations for traditional restaurants worldwide to provide tourists with a local, authentic culinary experience. At the heart of the standard is preserving tradition, from specifying what restaurants should look like to how food is to be served to demonstrate that they stay true to their heritage. This will help tourists make more informed choices on where to dine and savour the locals\u2019 culinary pride.\nTravelling green\nSustainability will continue to be a priority for hotels in 2022 and beyond, with recent studies suggesting that 76 % of travellers would choose accommodation facilities that have sustainable practices in place. With the help of ISO 21401, accommodation facilities can improve their environmental impact, promote social exchange and contribute to local communities.\nAccommodation is pivotal for tourist activities and holds immense potential for sustainable tourism. The global interest in sustainability increases people\u2019s desire to experience more sustainable services and products.

With regard to sustainable tourism development, travel for people with disabilities constitutes an opportunity to increase the overall quality of tourist facilities [ 17 ]. Although studies demonstrate the potential of accessible tourism [ 7 13 ], there is a lack of studies focusing on product development for people with disabilities with regard to the sustainable tourism concept. This research therefore relates to the study of accessible tourism product development as a part of sustainable tourism and focuses on the following research question:\nAccessible tourism represents an increasingly relevant segment for tourism development. While the broadly known term \u201cbarrier free tourism\u201d concentrates explicitly on people with disabilities, \u201caccessible tourism\u201d takes all potential visitors of a destination into account [ 8 ]. Accordingly, the concept of accessible tourism pays heed to the \u201cdesign for all\u201d approach, which notes that all user-groups deserve holistic tourism experiences [ 9 10 ]. The tourism industry faces significant challenges related to the implementation of accessible tourism, which leads to continuous critique regarding the omnipresent exclusion of people with disabilities [ 11 12 ]. Moreover, it is argued that the huge potential for accessible tourism is still neglected in the planning and realization process of tourist facilities [ 13 ], although more than 135 million people in Europe live with disabilities [ 14 ] and the number of people at the age of 65 and older is forecast to increase from its current 20% of the population to 30% by the year 2100 [ 15 ]. Thus, referring to the UNWTO [ 16 ], accessible tourism presents an opportunity for destinations and businesses to increase their revenues by attracting new visitors.\nThe tourism industry contributes significantly to the global economy [ 1 ], Europe being the largest tourism continent with approximately 50% of the global overnight stays in 2018 [ 2 ]. Product development in tourism is thus focused on attracting tourists to a destination. Benur and Bramwell [ 3 ] demonstrate in this context that diversified, linked, and intensified products correspond to destinations\u2019 competitiveness and sustainable development. Sustainability in tourism is represented by the sustainable tourism concept, which focuses on meeting \u201cthe needs of present tourists and host regions while protecting and enhancing opportunity for the future.\u201d [ 4 ] (p. 7) Thus, sustainable tourism addresses the balancing of economic, social and environmental tourism impacts by pursuing 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [ 5 ], emphasizing the absence of poverty, as well as empowering less favored groups [ 6 ]. In terms of considering people with disabilities, Darcy et al. [ 7 ] place accessible tourism as a part of the social, environmental, and economic requirements for the implementation of sustainable tourism.\nThus, building on the TBL, this research focuses on product development with objectives of environmental protection, economic prosperity, and social responsibility [ 51 52 ]. According to Mattioda, Fernandes, Detro, Casela and Canciglieri Junior [ 52 ], research on product development in light of the TBL concept is still at an initial stage, making further research necessary. Furthermore, as Haid and Albrecht [ 44 ] recommend studying sustainable tourism product development for particular types of tourist products, this research focuses on products for people with disabilities, in line with the accessible tourism approach.\nFollowing the TBL approach, individual businesses play an important role in the development of sustainable tourism [ 27 ]. Darcy, Cameron and Pegg [ 7 ] linked accessible tourism to the TBL framework by identifying economic, social, and environmental aspects of accessible tourism. In this respect, accessible tourism is based on a set of social networks of destinations rather than individual tourism organizations. Thus, Darcy, Cameron and Pegg [ 7 ] advocate the development of an accessible destination experience to satisfy the tourism market. A key objective of the TBL is that performance is not based solely on shareholder benefits, but rather on the inclusion of all stakeholders, including groups such as community residents [ 26 ]. The central meaning of stakeholder collaboration in project management is emphasized by several authors [ 45 46 ]. Although stakeholder collaboration is considered an important tool to foster the destination image in tourism management in a sustainable manner [ 47 ], this is found to be complex and scarce [ 48 ]. Gillovic and McIntosh [ 10 ] identified a lack of stakeholder collaboration in the development of accessible tourism. In addition, Nyanjom et al. [ 49 ] concluded that there is only minimal collaboration among different stakeholder groups in the development of accessible facilities. However, according to the UNWTO [ 50 ], the cooperation of all public and private stakeholders is required to implement accessibility, placing destinations at the centre of all tourism activities and thus being seen as promoters and disseminators of accessible tourism.\nFor Benur and Bramwell [ 3 ], sustainable development can be supported by developing a mix of tourism products that are mutually beneficial and have collaborative relationships. Thus, profitable products that meet strategic objectives potentially contribute to sustainability [ 3 ]. Following Eckert and Pechlaner [ 43 ], diversification in the form of tourism products is therefore necessary to develop sustainability in tourism. In this regard, a product development approach is targeted to contribute to sustainable tourism. Thus, the coexistence of alternative as well as traditional tourism products is discussed, with a focus on going beyond existing tourism models by focusing on themes and values that characterize a destination. The tourism products help to address destination challenges, for example, by considering the local community as well as dealing with environmental issues [ 43 ], in line with the sustainable tourism concept [ 21 ]. Haid and Albrecht [ 44 ] show that products for sustainable tourism can be developed by adjusting distribution channels and supply chains with the introduction of a sustainability requirement.\nTourism products are developed to meet the needs of potential consumers [ 40 ] and thus attract tourists to destinations [ 3 ]. In this context, tourism products consist of five elements: hospitality, service, inclusion, choice, and physical plant [ 41 ], which are all pull factors aimed at motivating tourists [ 3 ]. Referring to Smith [ 41 ], product development in tourism is characterized by raw inputs being the beginning of generic production, followed by intermediate outputs and inputs leading to tourists\u2019 experiences as final output. Successful integration of the five elements thus leads to the development of a product that is designed to attract tourists\u2019 attention and satisfy their needs [ 40 ]. Following Shuhsien et al. [ 42 ], knowledge about the patterns of consumer demand, consumer preferences, as well as tourism flow is required for strategic tourism product development. Referring to Benur and Bramwell [ 3 ], tourism product linkage, diversification, and intensification are crucial for sustainable development, as well as for destination competitiveness. Thus, tourism products are developed for both mass and niche markets to improve diversification [ 3 ].\nTo foster the development of accessible tourism, different tourism stakeholders need to share similar perceptions on people with disabilities [ 36 ]. In this regard, Oliver [ 31 ] highlights the differentiation between the medical and the social model of disability. The medical approach to disability, which is still predominant in Europe, refers to disability as a result of limited functioning in moving, hearing, seeing, or learning [ 13 31 ]. This is equivalent to a former statement by the WHO [ 37 ] which referred to disabilities as individual problems that trigger obstacles in a natural manner. In contrast to that, the social model of disability refers to disabilities as a result of societal evolution and perceives disability as a social construct that excludes people with disabilities from social participation [ 31 ]. Over the past 40 years, the perspective of the WHO on disabilities has shifted to accord with the social model of disability [ 14 ]. However, to trigger a shift towards the social perspective on disabilities in society, a collective campaign action for change is fundamental [ 38 ]. McIntosh [ 11 ] concludes that such a collective campaign can be achieved by sustainable tourism development for all. According to the UNWTO [ 39 ], the COVID-19 pandemic can serve as a trigger for the development of good accessibility for persons with disabilities to combat the negative effects of the crisis.\nPeople with disabilities in the context of tourism were first reported in relation to the Paralympic games in 1960 [ 29 ]. Twenty years later, Woodside and Etzel [ 30 ] first investigated the travel behavior of people with disabilities. Since then, several concepts for bridging tourism and disability have emerged [ 13 ]. However, the tourism industry is still repeatedly criticized for its exclusive attitude [ 31 ]. This is ascribed to the fact that the requirements and needs of people with disabilities are frequently neglected in the development of tourism products and in the implementation of tourism services [ 12 ]. People with different types and dimensions of disability have in common that their right to social participation is repeatedly unsatisfied [ 32 ]. Different from the broadly known concept of \u201cbarrier free\u201d tourism, accessible tourism includes, in addition to people with disabilities, seniors, families, pregnant women, and people with temporary disabilities [ 13 ]. In this regard, Dickson et al. [ 33 ] conclude that everyone with or without disability will appreciate accessibility once in a lifetime. Moreover, people with disabilities are commonly accompanied by their colleagues or families when travelling and show a high rate of return if destinations fit their accessibility requirements [ 34 ]. Due to demographic changes, there is also an increasing number of seniors travelling, who show, due to retirement, a low seasonal dependency [ 15 35 ]. Thus, accessible tourism development promises a considerable potential.\nSince the inclusion of people with disabilities in the SDGs, the importance of addressing this segment in tourism development has increased [ 28 ]. Following the SDGs, sustainable tourism focuses on the empowerment of disadvantaged groups and the prevention of poverty [ 6 ]. According to Sisto, Cappelletti, Bianchi and Sica [ 18 ], accessible tourism is a key prerequisite for all sustainable tourism strategies and policies. The consideration of people with disabilities is based on socially, economically as well as ecologically sustainable implementation [ 7 ]. Therefore, accessible tourism is an important part of the global sustainable tourism agenda, with accessible tourism being defined as a form of responsible tourism to include people with disabilities [ 17 ]. For the UNWTO [ 16 ], accessibility in tourism must be a central component of all sustainable and responsible tourism policies.\nHowever, Demeritt [ 23 ] criticizes sustainability, claiming that divergent social group interests distract attention from problematic policies by focusing on economic, social, and environmental problems in relation to the SDGs [ 5 ]. Following Higgins-Desbiolles [ 24 ], there is also a discrepancy between tourism and the SDGs, as tourism development is often still based on quantitative growth, such as the goal of increasing the number of overnight stays still being pursued. Accordingly, without considering the environmental and social impacts of tourism, the economic benefits of tourism are considered, and the SDGs are neglected accordingly. Therefore, tourism encounters environmental and social limits but continues to be geared towards growth, which requires comprehensive transformations [ 24 ]. According to Mihalic [ 25 ] sustainable tourism is based on divergent environments that underlie tourism ecology within the tourism system, referring to the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) framework [ 26 ]. The TBL is adopted by tourism organizations in an attempt to incorporate social and environmental sustainable development strategies alongside economic sustainability [ 26 ]. For Dwyer [ 27 ], the TBL provides a decision-making framework in sustainable tourism for both public and private organizations, serving as an external reporting framework and an internal management tool with the aim of achieving sustainable management by integrating social, environmental, and economic considerations into business activities.\nSustainable tourism is widely acknowledged in tourism research and practice, referring to tourism policy, destination management organizations (DMOs), or tourism businesses [ 5 ]. Since its emergence in the 1980s, sustainable tourism has evolved considerably, without, however, detracting from its still considerable relevance [ 19 ]. Sustainable tourism refers to a development [ 20 ] that seeks to protect both tourism communities and tourists while providing opportunities for the future [ 4 ]. In this respect, sustainable tourism builds on the SDGs as introduced by the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development [ 5 ]. The SDGs are focused on economic, environmental, and social impacts in order to reduce global poverty [ 21 ]. Sustainable tourism thus aims to achieve a balance between positive and negative impacts of tourism development, approaching the three pillars of sustainability [ 21 22 ].\nThe data were analyzed following the template analysis approach of King [ 58 ]. In an attempt to pursue a facilitated and systematic data analysis process, MAXQDA was used as qualitative data analysis software. Following the template analysis, the two authors collaboratively developed an initial coding template with a priori themes and a priori codes being defined on the basis of previous studies. In order to enhance the quality of the data analysis, after an evaluation of the interview data, the coding template was revised separately by the researchers. A discussion about parallel findings resulted in a rewording and redefinition of the final coding template. Thus, critical comparison between the two researchers, alongside the independent coding, made it possible to modify the template and thus enhance the overall quality of this research [ 58 59 ]. Additionally, all divergent interviewees\u2019 opinions were incorporated in the data analysis process in order to enhance the objectivity of the research [ 60 ].\nEven though the use of business cases is considered a good tool for raising awareness of the potential of accessible tourism, their application is still underdeveloped [ 7 18 ]. Darcy, Cameron and Pegg [ 7 ] (p. 533) conclude that \u201cuntil examples of good business practice are identified and promoted, the industry cannot be guided with certainty about the benefits in providing expanded accessible tourism products\u201d. Thus, a multiple case study method is adopted, which is particularly useful when developing an understanding of real-life phenomena [ 53 54 ]. In collaboration with organizations for people with disabilities in Italy and Austria, four leisure parks as tourist facilities in Central Europe were selected. The choice was based on three criteria. First, the facilities had to offer products for accessible tourism that were developed in the recent past. Second, facilities that are characterized by nature experiences were regarded. Third, the institutions were proved to have a maximum number of 15 employees. Thus, a purposive sampling technique was applied. For each tourist facility, two representatives involved in the product development process were interviewed, as Haid and Albrecht [ 44 ] recommended including owners or operators in studies on product development for sustainable tourism. The interviews lasted an average of 77 min and were conducted online via Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic and consequent travel restrictions. The interview guideline was developed based on existing research on sustainable tourism [ 19 22 ], accessible tourism [ 7 28 ], and product development [ 3 44 ] literature. In this regard, questions regarding the process of product development, its implementation, and its completion were asked as key themes of the interview guideline. The semi-structured interviews made it possible to delve deeply into the experiences of the interviewees [ 55 ], and the data was triangulated [ 56 ] with publicly available information about the products developed, e.g., from the websites of the tourist facilities. Organization-specific data including the location and size of the organization and the position of the interviewee [ 57 ] (see Table 1 ) was collected by the authors.\n4. Results\n4.1. Values Both the secondary data and the interview analysis reveal that all the tourist facilities researched convey similar core values for their regions. One such major element is nature, which is displayed prominently on all four tourist facilities\u2019 websites. Thus, central to all participants is to provide the best possible nature experience by \u201cbuilding everything on the relation between the person and nature\u201d (TF2_2_10). Similar philosophies can be seen with regard to the consideration of nature in the destinations. Here, the interviewees show that they use nature as a basis on which to build their product developments: \u201cOne thing that we tried was to develop a product, that is to build on the relationship between the park and nature. [\u2026] he felt that the product actually gives him the opportunity to experience this relationship\u201d (TF2_1_23). In addition to that, three of the four regions convey cultural and historical backgrounds: \u201cThe most important requirement was that it should be an immersive experience of the World Heritage Site [\u2026] and bring added value. That was the initial situation\u201d (TF1_1_3). Finally, the analysis of the websites results in the conclusion that leisure is the central anchor of all these tourist facilities. Thus, they display leisure activities for both guests and residents. In the course of the respective product developments, the participating regions\u2019 values, namely, nature, culture, and leisure experiences, were to be made available to people with disabilities. However, the developments at the tourist facilities were not meant to be supportive solely of people with disabilities but were also for people without disabilities. \u201cIn this respect, it is a technology or an application that brings something to all visitors and has been developed on a broad basis.\u201d (TF1_2_3). Furthermore, according to the interviewees, value should be created in terms of opportunities and alternatives, as this quote shows: \u201cWe don\u2019t just want to make something that is useful for people or visitors with a walking disability, but it is important to us that this visitor platform at the top is an added value for days when it rains, or out of season\u2014when there is perhaps a winter closure, where it is too icy or too slippery to enter the gorge\u201d (TF1_1_3). Retrospectively, the lessons learned from working on the inclusion of people with disabilities are twofold. While the tourist facilities mainly stated that they would realize the product development in a similar manner again, there are still some issues related to that. To increase the sustainability of the implementation process, suppliers would have needed to receive a deeper briefing on the core themes of the respective facilities and destinations. Such takeaways made participants conclude that \u201c[\u2026] if I had to make another trail of perception now, I would be less clueless. So, I would have already a method because as we showed during our presentation, now we have kind of a model\u201d (TF3_2_24).\n4.2. Product Development For product development, the interviewees indicated that they tried to make the best use of the manifold potential of information provision for everyone: \u201cWe wanted to offer this new opportunity with all the physical and also technological tools and instruments to facilitate\u2014not just facilitate, also give this experience a natural flavor\u201d (TF3_1_1). Thus, interviewees indicated that inclusion of people with disabilities took a central role throughout the product development: \u201c[\u2026] the focus was inclusive communication as a way to involve those who are sometimes neglected or are not taken into consideration when developing this kind of product, which means especially that deaf people or people with visual impairments, but also pregnant mothers, children, as well as old people are to be regarded\u201d (TF2_1_9). The applications were planned in a way that should enhance the ability of people with disabilities to experience the facilities and regions on their own. \u201cActually, the trail of perceptions in some segments of the trail allows the visually impaired people and also people in wheelchairs to have the experience all alone. So, this is another very important aspect which is very positive for people with disabilities\u201d (TF3_1_3). Throughout the product\u2019s development, feedback from the target groups was described as essential: \u201cThe two visually impaired ladies told us that there might be some points\u2014where there is water, that could be a little bit difficult. But if you have someone who will show you where to put your feet, it is no problem\u201d (TF3_1_3). In addition, feedback from H&T service providers as promoters of the product was requested in the way that \u201cwe have sent it to 31 hotels of medium and large size. [\u2026] We asked all of them for some feedback where the managers were asked to describe if it fits their requirements or not\u201d (TF4_1_17). To reach the best possible outcome, the feedback was taken into consideration and brought up the relevant consequences regarding further development. For instance, infographics were adjusted, special virtual reality effects were reduced, the web app was enhanced with new features, and the contrast level in illustrations was adapted. These improvements, however, did not always work out as expected beforehand and led to several drawbacks for the parties responsible. One such was caused by bureaucracy, e.g., \u201cWe may have 8 different info-panels in 8 municipalities, and I have to get the permission of 8 different municipalities before I install a sign anywhere\u201d (TF1_2_29). In terms of the product development phase, the most important lesson learnt at the four tourist facilities is aimed at stakeholder collaboration: \u201cThey were working together, and they were not just working on it in an isolated way. So, they were not just working on this and that. They were all working together, updating each other\u201d (TF2_2_38). Accordingly, the fusion of different interests is described as an essential tool for fostering a sustainable product development. To avoid conflicts between the parties involved, clarity of roles is of vital importance. In particular, the development of accessible implementations is characterized as a \u201cmultidisciplinary system of work, which brings together different competences, such as narratives, as well as IT and accessibility experts\u201d (TF2_2_38). On the one hand, it is important to \u201c[\u2026] have suppliers that are aware that they are doing something for a particular target group\u201d (TF3_2_22). On the other hand, there are stakeholder groups that are in a position to put greater pressure on accessible tourism development than others, as this quote shows: \u201cWe do not have a mandate. There must be entities that have a mandate involved [\u2026] for example representatives of people with disabilities or organizations for people with disabilities\u201d (TF4_2_86). In addition to the involvement of stakeholder groups, such as H&T service providers, volunteers, municipalities, and suppliers, the continuous involvement of the target groups is fundamental in order to take account of all the potential requirements of people with disabilities throughout the development process: \u201cThe main aspect is to involve the specific target group that you are working for, because they can, in certain cases, change a lot the perspective that you have and that you think is the right one. And so, they can help you to avoid making big mistakes that maybe cannot be solved, if you do not involve them from the beginning\u201d (TF3_2_22). COVID-19 had several impacts on the product development process for the tourist facilities: \u201cDuring coronavirus, we had some delays, some significant delays due to the fact that suppliers were not able to work, or they were supplied or expecting supplies of goods from different countries with border problems\u201d (TF2_2_50). To catch up again, \u201cwe asked to prolong the end of the project. But the lead partner informed us that it was not possible\u201d (TF3_2_28). In addition to that, the pandemic situation led to limited financial resources, which forced the tourist facilities to concentrate on their core competences and required that \u201c[\u2026] the visitor survey be in some way suspended or executed in a reduced form this year\u201d (TF1_1_76). In addition to issues related to the pandemic situations, limited resources were also mentioned: \u201cThere you can insert many new trails and provide even more detailed descriptions. However, this would have required much more effort which we were not able to afford\u201d (TF4_1_4)."}, {"title": "Accessibility", "article": "Accessible tourism\nAll tourism businesses and institutions should aim to be universally accessible and create barrier-free tourism.

From minor annoyances to violent crimes, getting from point A to B can be fraught with risk.\nGoal 11 of the United Nations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sustainable development goals exhorts member states to provide safe, affordable, and accessible transportation for everyone, especially those who find themselves in vulnerable situations. And yet, while disparate initiatives have been launched around the world to make public commutes safer and accessible for everyone, a survey of the United Nations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and other international agencies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 research, plus our own analysis, suggests there is still more to be done across the three main stages of the commuter journey: planning and booking, the predeparture experience at boarding areas, and the travel itself.\nIn this article, we consider just how inclusive global public-transit systems are and explore ways that municipalities, urban planners, and other key stakeholders can assess and accommodate the end-to-end needs of all travelers.\nHow inclusive are our public-transit systems?\nOver the past decade, international organizations such as the United Nations have made the concerted effort to study inclusivity in urban-transport systems as a means to guarantee fair opportunities for all commuters. The insights that have come out of this endeavor fall under two broad themes.\nFirst, a collection of studies\u00e2\u0080\u0094including the UN Commission on the Status of Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Safe cities and safe public spaces for women and girls study\u00e2\u0080\u0094provide analyses of the key safety and communications issues that public-transport operators need to address. These include reducing violence and harassment on public transit, ensuring safer nighttime commutes, and providing clear, effective, around-the-clock communication between operators and travelers.\nSecond, a separate stream of research studies the main barriers that limit inclusion on public transit for women, people with disabilities, and low-income travelers, among others. Critical obstacles include, among others, poorly designed transportation, high ticket prices, inadequate safety regulations, and schedules that fail to account for the travel patterns of commuters with specific needs.\nAs they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve become aware of these issues and limitations, many public-transit system providers and urban planners have launched initiatives to address them\u00e2\u0080\u0094to limited effect, however. Such campaigns and programs have typically been introduced in an ad hoc manner rather than integrated into the overall public-transport system.\nSome cities, such as Los Angeles and Santiago, focused on surveying travel patterns of public-transit users, while others, including a major European capital and a large city in Southeast Asia, mostly worked on communication campaigns to raise awareness of nighttime safety. Other cities\u00e2\u0080\u0099 efforts were limited in scope. In Madrid, for example, on-demand bus stops were introduced on suburban routes during specific times to reduce the walking distance home for female passengers.\nFrom booking to travel: An end-to-end approach to inclusion\nShare From the inside out: Inclusion in the urban-transport workforce According to the latest Kantar Inclusion Index, less than half of transportation employees believe that their organizations are actively pursuing inclusion. In addition, the sector reports above-average workplace bullying/harassment and situations in which employees were made to feel uncomfortable. Fostering greater inclusion for public-transport employees requires providers to start with an accurate assessment of where they stand. Then, they can begin embarking on diversity, equity, and inclusion\u00c2 (DEI) transformation journeys to reshape their way of working. Diversity refers to workforce composition across various identity-related characteristics, such as gender, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, and disabilities. Equity focuses on ensuring that identity is not predictive of opportunities or workplace outcomes. Inclusion refers to the degree to which an individual feels that they can bring their authentic selves to work, enabling them to contribute in a meaningful and deliberate manner. From our experience working in this space, public-transport providers can gain DEI awareness in different ways. Sometimes targeted, eye-opening workshops aimed at uncovering deeply rooted unconscious bias represent a wake-up call for organizations: having diverse subsets of colleagues collaborate to identify unexpected biases in their ways of thinking is sometimes sufficient to trigger top-management engagement toward a new way of working. In other cases, transport agencies go even further and fully train their staff on civil-rights issues, among others, and on potential biases toward underrepresented categories. In other cases, achieving a profound understanding of the internal level of inclusivity can require more time and various sessions at all levels of the organization. Once companies agree that room for improvement exists, the journey to a fully inclusive work environment unfolds. After the first step of assessing and building the fact base through company-specific business cases, other challenging steps of the process remain: Architect (development of key performance indicators and road map): beginning with a solid awareness and understanding of the internal level of inclusion, companies develop a plan by designing a portfolio of initiatives linked to specific and tangible objectives, prioritizing them on feasibility and expected impact. The initiatives plan is complemented by the identification of pilots to be launched and tested, either on selected perimeters or on a company-wide basis.\nAct (test and learn with quick programs): companies start launching pilots and initiatives on target business units, functions, and geographies, in line with the agreed-upon implementation plan. As the plan unfolds, insights from pilots can be used to learn and refine ongoing and future initiatives.\nAdvance (build on success and track progress): in the core phase of the implementation, companies get the program to full scale. This requires a strong monitoring and accountability structure, alongside a proven knowledge codification and sharing system to constantly improve idea generation and the implementation of initiatives. Among public-transportation providers, one of the most notable programs in the past few years was launched by the roads and transport authority in a major city in the Middle East, which focused on including and elevating women\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, it created a dedicated fund for high-performing women employees and another initiative for \u00e2\u0080\u009cpeople of determination,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which included ad hoc employment and training programs.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time for urban-transport providers to draw from our collective understanding of inclusion and design and implement an urban-transport system that works for everyone. While this article focuses on the customer journey, travel providers should not miss the opportunity to transform their own organizations as well (see sidebar, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom the inside out: Inclusion in the urban-transport workforce\u00e2\u0080\u009d).\nTo further contribute to our existing understanding of travel and inclusion, we conducted our own research. We surveyed more than 20 different public-transport operators around the world and identified key requirements and initiatives for an inclusive public-transport system. We found that while there are many initiatives to enhance inclusion, they are typically not part of an integrated, 360-degree framework. We believe that a comprehensive and integrated approach to inclusive transportation comprises initiatives that fall into six categories (Exhibit 1).\n1\nWe mapped these requirements and initiatives along the commuter journey, which we broke down into three parts: the booking stage, the predeparture stage, and the actual travel experience (Exhibit 2). In each phase, there are actions travel providers can take to address specific pain points. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll explore those actions using the example of a rail-based journey\u00e2\u0080\u0094although the conceptual principles here can be applied to other forms of urban transport, such as buses and ferries.\n2\nThe booking stage\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s common nowadays for people to use navigation apps to find the most convenient route to their destination. The would-be passenger decides on the starting and arrival points, preferred mode of transport, and time of travel. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll factor in potential route disruptions (and explore alternatives, if necessary), how crowded the commute might be, and whether there are any loyalty-program benefits to be accrued.\nThis stage presents a number of potential pain points for some commuters. For instance, a wheelchair user may not know if a train station is equipped with elevators and if there are design barriers that may make it difficult to board and alight from a train.\nSome cities have tried to create a more accessible and safe experience for senior travelers. For instance, Salzburg has launched initiatives to promote the use of public transport among older people. The city has hosted \u00e2\u0080\u009cmobility days,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and pamphlets on commuter safety can be found in all train stations. Salzburg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bus drivers are also trained to be extra vigilant around older passengers, and vehicles are designed with senior citizens in mind. These initiatives have reduced accidents among older people and increased awareness among the remaining population.\nOur research points to a number of actions urban-transport providers can take at the booking and planning stage to create more inclusion. For instance, they could create pooling options in their travel apps so that passengers could choose to commute in groups. They may offer special rates at this stage as well, to disabuse people of the idea that accessible travel options are more expensive than standard ones. Passengers could also be given the option to easily share their itinerary with their friends and loved ones for an additional layer of oversight.\nTravel providers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 mobile apps may also provide a direct line of communication between the traveler and the provider and are a tool providers may want to use more strategically. Safety issues could be flagged immediately. Information about security measures, optimal travel times, and easy-access facilities could be relayed through this channel when passengers check and confirm their itinerary. The Transport for London, for instance, allows for just this with its dedicated journey planner; the app lets would-be passengers optimize their journey from the booking stage.\nPredeparture phase\nArriving at a station or terminal can be an overwhelming experience, with hordes of people crisscrossing in every possible direction\u00e2\u0080\u0094businesspeople rushing to catch their trains with barely minutes to spare, families trying to herd rowdy children toward the right platform, and buskers plying their craft.\nFor many, the predeparture phase looks like this: you receive a push notification from your travel provider with information about your train\u00e2\u0080\u0099s departure time. To get to the platform you go through a thermal-imaging scanner that checks your temperature, you make it past the turnstile with an electronic ticket, and you find the correct platform, where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll wait to board.\nFor groups or travelers with specific logistical needs, this phase can be full of hazards. If they are early for their train, for instance, such passengers may find few accessible waiting spaces to accommodate them.\nThere are a number of ways urban-travel providers can improve the predeparture experience for all travelers. They may want to integrate important safety and pooling information into the departure reminder, noting the location of accessible facilities and safe train cars\u00e2\u0080\u0094carriages with an attendant, conductor, or security officer. Visual \u00e2\u0080\u009cnudges\u00e2\u0080\u009d and cues could promote positive behaviors, such as offering assistance to people with mobility constraints or to pregnant women. In stations where longer wait times are common, more rooms for nursing mothers and a greater number of dedicated waiting areas could be created. Treating the station as a civic space by promoting community-focused activities\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as increasing retail outlets and installing open pianos\u00e2\u0080\u0094could also enhance commuters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sense of safety.\nIn 2006, the city of Graz, Austria, upgraded its key stops to make them both more accessible and livable; and, targeting both safety and comfort in its train platforms and stations, the Canadian cities of Ottawa and Toronto created designated Transecure waiting areas.\nTraveling and arriving at the destination\nThere are a number of actions travel providers can take to make passengers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 journeys inclusive once they are on board. For instance, it is possible for travelers on most trains to track their progress while en route\u00e2\u0080\u0094but it may not always be clear how to request help in cases of violence of harassment. Particularly when it comes to late-night routes, passengers may be in near-empty train cars. To provide peace of mind for all passengers, urban-travel planners should install highly visible GPS panic buttons throughout the system, as they have in New Delhi and Bangalore.\nCommuters with specific needs could be directed to the train\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safe wagons with security personnel and closer supervision. Pregnant women or passengers with specific physical needs could wear \u00e2\u0080\u009cMay I sit\u00e2\u0080\u009d pins to alert other commuters to give way to them. Travel providers could also make it easier for these commuters to find information about connections and the safest ways to get to the next boarding point.\nWhile our case study focuses on rail travel, alternative transport modes may offer other opportunities for greater inclusion. The flexibility afforded by bus travel presents more options for making the travel experience safer. Passengers could be allowed to alight, on request, at specific time slots, for example, from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m., to reduce the distance between the drop-off point to the final destination. This is exactly what the city of Madrid put in place, arranging on-demand night bus stops on interurban bus lines.\nCreating an inclusive urban-transport system doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop the moment a passenger gets off the train. Transport providers could review the arrival experiences and partner with security companies to provide additional support or with taxi and rideshare companies to provide special rates for arriving passengers.\nSetting the goal of an entirely accessible public-transport system is becoming increasingly common in major cities worldwide. Barcelona has committed to a 100 percent accessible underground metro system by 2024, and Seattle is already fully wheelchair accessible.\nOther municipalities and travel providers can do the same by undertaking a thorough assessment of customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 needs along the whole journey, mapping the potential pain points, and implementing targeted initiatives to address them. Of course, this process is an iterative one; any initiatives launched should be evaluated and refined over time. The systemic, end-to-end approach outlined in this article should help make traveling in our cities truly safer for all."}, {"title": null, "article": null}, {"title": null, "article": null}, {"title": "Strategic Plan on Accessible Transportation", "article": "The U.S. Department of Transportation has published a draft of its first Strategic Plan on Accessible Transportation (Strategic Plan), a noteworthy step in making America\u2019s transportation system more accessible for all travelers.\nThe draft Strategic Plan reflects ongoing and future initiatives across the Department\u2019s operating administrations to enhance accessibility and remove barriers in transportation for people with disabilities.

While this utopian view sounds like something we should strive for, we are missing two critical aspects of mobility, says Carol Schweiger, President of Schweiger Consulting and Chairperson of the New England Intelligent Transportation Society: accessibility and inclusivity.\nIt is imperative that mobility \u2013 regardless of how it is powered and how it is integrated \u2013 is firstly, accessible to all (including passengers with reduced mobility), and secondly, equitable, meaning it is available to all irrespective of a traveller\u2019s demographic.\nIn the U.S., accessible mobility was considered in the development of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). In 1990, when the ADA became law, the transportation-related implications were far-reaching and for the most part, the required changes in public transport were unfunded. As I was evaluating public transport agencies\u2019 compliance with the law over the several years after the ADA was implemented, it was obvious that in the future, if we did not think about accessible and equitable mobility, we could face a very similar situation \u2013 an unfunded mandate that could significantly burden local and state agencies.\nAccessible transport technology\nWhen the ADA became law, there was very limited use of technology \u2013 particularly technology that could make transport accessible and inclusive. Furthermore, the ADA did not contain any rules about making transport technology accessible. For example, there were no rules to accommodate passengers with visual impairments if a dynamic message sign (DMS) displaying real-time public transport information was deployed. However, with the advent of this and many more technologies to facilitate mobility, guidance had to be developed to ensure that everyone could access real-time information on a DMS, such as DMS position and viewing angle. To complicate matters, this \u2018guidance\u2019, which is provided typically through the ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG), is not a regulation. Fortunately, transport agencies often use the ADAAG to develop policies, including those for ensuring that technology used to facilitate mobility is accessible. In the aforementioned example, some agencies have a policy that requires DMS to have a push-button which can be used to \u2018read\u2019 what is displayed on the DMS for people with visual impairments.\nFast forward to 2018, a time in which technology is everywhere and our focus is on mobility for everyone. While technology definitely facilitates mobility for all, there are specific technologies that directly address the needs of passengers with reduced mobility. The U.S. Department of Transportation\u2019s (USDOT\u2019s) Accessible Transportation Technologies Research Initiative (ATTRI)1 is leading efforts to develop and implement transformative applications to improve mobility options for all travellers, particularly those with disabilities. After a comprehensive user-needs assessment, the ATTRI selected four technology areas in which to fund application development: wayfinding and navigation; pre-trip concierge and virtualisation; safe intersection crossing; and robotics and automation. \u201cWorking together, the four technology areas will provide the basis for an accessible transportation network that is far more economical, expansive and welcoming than we have now, which is of increasing importance not only to travellers with disabilities, but to all travellers in the United States.\u201d\n\u201cThe accessibility of a transportation system can be described in terms of the ability of individuals to go from home to a destination without breaks, or in terms of a travel chain with various links such as trip planning, travel to station, station and stop use, boarding vehicles, using vehicles, leaving vehicles, using the stop or transferring, and travel to destination after leaving the station or stop. If one link is not accessible, then access to a subsequent link is unattainable and the trip cannot be completed. Thus, the travel chain defines the scope of potential research and development in accessible transportation.\u201d2\nAutomated vehicle technology\nAnother perspective of accessible transport is the regulatory aspect of safety and ADA compliance in the context of automated vehicles (AVs) used in public transport. \u201cPassenger access to platforms, assistance with boarding vehicles and docking/securing patrons in wheelchairs are all significant challenges of AV transit. When no driver is onboard a public transit vehicle, how will these things be accomplished? Depending upon the disability, additional technology solutions (auto-energised ramps, auto-securing tie-downs, etc.) may be required to perform these functions without human assistance.\u201d3\nAs stated in Preparing for the Future of Transportation: Automated Vehicles 3.0: \u201cMachine vision, artificial intelligence (AI), assistive robots and facial recognition software solving a variety of travel-related issues for persons with disabilities in vehicles, devices and terminals, are included to create virtual caregivers/concierge services and other such applications to guide travellers and assist in decision making.\u201d4\nAnother aspect of accessible transport technology that is being discussed frequently is in the development of AVs, especially those that will provide first-mile and last-mile services to and from public transport. As I discussed in an earlier article5, accessible AVs are being designed and developed despite the fact that the ADA does not cover AVs. However, considering accessibility factors in AV design must be done early in the design process or the industry runs the risk of having to retrofit vehicles as well as facing protests from disability and elderly groups.\nAchieving equitable transport\nIn terms of equity and inclusion, an effort at USDOT examined the technology and policy implications of transport equity. A framework entitled \u2018STEPS to Transportation Equity\u2019 was developed as part of this effort. Spatial, Temporal, Economic, Physiological and Social (STEPS) barriers were identified along with opportunities and challenges in the technology and policy areas6. For example, policy-related opportunities exist in the area of transport payment using smartphones and credit/debit cards. This could be a barrier for disabled, low-income and elderly travellers. The policy-related opportunities in this example are as follows:\nOffering alternative payment modes (e.g. short message service (SMS)/text access) that do not require a smartphone, credit card or a bank account\nMoving public transport payment systems from card-based to account-based systems, which may allow riders to pay using alternate means that the \u2018unbanked\u2019 typically use, such as \u2018Pay Near Me\u2019.\nIn the near future, Los Angeles Metro, through their Transit Access Pass (TAP) Program will be providing \u201cnew equitable ways to load value for the unbanked and discounts for specific groups such as seniors, students, low-income riders and more. [They will] have options to load cash into their TAP accounts and this enables the cash customers to participate in programmes like bike-share where before you could only participate with a credit or debit card.\u201d7\nSo how do we ensure accessible and inclusive transport in the future? Technology can facilitate accessible mobility but could actually hinder inclusive/equitable transport. It is policy, when combined with technology that will overcome the barriers. As discovered in the ATTRI, policy considerations will go further than technology alone.8\nTechnology must be combined with policy\nPolicy will play a role in evaluating and correcting the perception of a limited market for technology in accessible transport by identifying ways to combine small market niches to make them more attractive and by providing subsidies to reduce the investment risk of serving the unmet demand. However, policy must take into consideration the impact of technological innovations on the disabled community, low income individuals and overall, the transportation disadvantaged.\nDevelopment-incentive policies could be used to encourage participation in the transport technology market as well as reduce the eventual costs of such technologies as products become more mainstream rather than specialised. In the U.S., several of these types of policies and programmes are available, mostly at the Federal level.\nWhile this is not a policy per se, providing user subsidies has the potential to provide transportation-disadvantaged individuals with technology that could facilitate their travel. For example, having access to assistive devices could greatly enhance transport for passengers with reduced mobility. Another example is providing low income individuals with smartphones or other technologies that can facilitate transport payments. Policies related to barriers in public rights-of-way should facilitate travel to and from public transport for passengers with disabilities.\nMobility Equity Framework\nThe \u2018Mobility Equity Framework\u20199, developed by The Greenlining Institute, can be adapted to best ensure that mobility is accessible and equitable. This adapted framework has three steps: firstly, identify the mobility needs of a specific community (e.g., disabled, low-income); secondly, conduct a mobility equity analysis to prioritise transportation technologies that best meet those needs while maximising benefits and minimising burdens; and finally, make decisions that include representation by the specific communities that are striving for accessible and inclusive mobility (these communities are often under-represented in organisations that make transport investment and deployment decisions).\nPerhaps the most important aspect of this adapted framework is in the second step. By examining several equity indicators10, the adapted framework answers these key questions:\nWill the transport technology investment or policy meet an important community need?\nAre the benefits significant?\nAre the specific communities (e.g. disabled, low-income) the primary beneficiaries?\nDoes the investment avoid substantial burdens?\nReferences:\nATTRI is a joint USDOT initiative, co-led by the US Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Federal Transit Administration (FTA), and Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office (ITS JPO), with support from the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR), and other federal partners.

These modifications enable an individual with a disability to have an equal opportunity not only to get a job, but successfully perform their job tasks to the same extent as people without disabilities. The ADA requires reasonable accommodations as they relate to three aspects of employment: 1) ensuring equal opportunity in the application process; 2) enabling a qualified individual with a disability to perform the essential functions of a job; and 3) making it possible for an employee with a disability to enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment.\nAccommodations are sometimes referred to as \u201cproductivity enhancers\u201d. Reasonable accommodations should not be viewed as \u201cspecial treatment\u201d and they often benefit all employees. For example, facility enhancements such as ramps, accessible restrooms, and ergonomic workstations benefit more than just employees with disabilities. Examples of reasonable accommodations include making existing facilities accessible; job restructuring; part-time or modified work schedules; acquiring or modifying equipment; changing tests, training materials, or policies; and providing qualified readers or interpreters. Here are some more examples. Many job accommodations cost very little and often involve minor changes to a work environment, schedule or work-related technologies:\nPhysical changes Installing a ramp or modifying a rest room Modifying the layout of a workspace\nAccessible and assistive technologies Ensuring computer software is accessible Providing screen reader software Using videophones to facilitate communications with colleagues who are deaf\nAccessible communications Providing sign language interpreters or closed captioning at meetings and events Making materials available in Braille or large print\nPolicy enhancements Modifying a policy to allow a service animal in a business setting Adjusting work schedules so employees with chronic medical conditions can go to medical appointments and complete their work at alternate times or locations\nThese are just a few example.

In disability employment antidiscrimination law and policy, perhaps the most important driver of the inclusion command is the \u201caccommodation principle,\u201d which requires that employers make reasonable adjustments to tasks and places of work to enable full and equal participation by qualified individuals with disabilities [2].\nIn the seminal 2004 U.S. Supreme Court case Tennessee v. Lane [3], the late Justice Ruth Ginsburg wrote of the centrality of the ADA\u2019s accommodation principle:\nIncluding individuals with disabilities among people who count in composing \u201cWe the People,\u201d Congress understood in shaping the ADA, would sometimes require not blindfolded equality, but responsiveness to difference; not indifference, but accommodation. Central to the Act\u2019s primary objective, Congress extended the statute\u2019s range to reach all government activities, [], and required \u2026 \u201creasonable accommodations.\u201d\nUnder the ADA, the word \u201cdiscriminate\u201d consequently includes failure to make reasonable accommodations to the physical and mental limitations of a qualified individual with a disability, in the absence of an \u201cundue hardship\u201d on the business [1]. Discrimination includes denying opportunities to a job applicant or employee if such denial is based on the need for the entity to make reasonable accommodations to that person\u2019s physical or mental conditions [1]. By directing employers to accept responsibility, within reason, for accommodations (up to the undue hardship ceiling), the ADA\u2019s Title I sets the ADA apart from other U.S. civil rights legislation.\nThe importance of the accommodation principle to disability inclusive employment law and policy is manifest [4]. The goal of offering equal employment opportunity to everyone, regardless of disability, is meaningless if the new hire uses a wheelchair and the sole entrance to the workplace is up a flight of stairs. The right to work rings hollow if people who are deaf or hard of hearing, who are blind or have low vision, or who have reading or cognitive disabilities cannot use or access a company\u2019s web-based technologies [5]. Opportunity is foreclosed when an employer will not alter work schedules within reason, or bars telework or remote work, without consideration for qualified individuals with episodic or mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety, that require flexibility [6].\nTitle I of the ADA defines the accommodation principle to include, within reason, making facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, as well as job restructuring, part-time and modified work schedules, remote work and telecommuting, modification of equipment and devices, and other effective means of enabling qualified individuals with disabilities to perform essential functions of their jobs, whether traditional or non-traditional [1]. The ADA gives substantial weight to an employer\u2019s definition of \u201cessential\u201d job functions and the extent to which such tasks may be done effectively with accommodation.\nResearch shows the low costs and the numerous benefits of the accommodation principle. Most workplace accommodations incur de minimis or near-zero costs [7,8,9,10]. Employers in most cases can accommodate people with disabilities with relative ease, formally or informally. Further, there are far-reaching, positive ripple effects from a \u201cculture of accommodation\u201d for all [11, 12]. At the organizational level, accommodations improve employee productivity, morale, and tenure. If an organization promotes a \u201cculture of inclusion,\u201d a climate of flexible and supportive approaches, it furthers effective and innovative accommodations and productive outcomes for all employees and for itself [9, 10, 13,14,15], and it enjoys the benefits of attracting and retaining qualified workers [13]. The ripple effect extends even further: promoting economic opportunity for people with disabilities produces a corresponding decrease in their need for federal disability insurance and other governmental support funding, along with a resultant increase in tax revenues.\nThe research thus suggests the value, to all of society, of documenting, devising, and promoting strategies to increase awareness and implementation of the accommodation principle across organizations of different sizes and types, and across market and labor sectors.\nAt the thirtieth anniversary of the ADA, the articles in this special topic section consider, variously, the future of disability-inclusive employment in light of how the accommodation principle works in contemporary society, and in light of its historical precedents. The accommodation principle as part of a disability inclusive employment paradigm is a concept of the late twentieth century. It contrasts with earlier vocational rehabilitation programs for people with disabilities, which historically were based on medicalized conceptions of disability [1, 16]. This \u201cMedical Model\u201d of disability focused on individual deficits, with impairments conceived of as infirmities that precluded participation in the mainstream economy [17, 18]. It cast people with disabilities in a subordinate role to doctors, rehabilitation professionals, and governmental bureaucrats, each of whom aimed to \u201chelp them,\u201d when \u201cdeserving,\u201d adjust to a society structured around the convenience, design, and interests of people without disabilities [17].\nIn contrast, the modern model is the Social Model of disability, which is sometimes called the Ecological Model, and, in the context of the ADA, the Disability Civil Rights Model. This model, however named, includes the accommodation principle. It has changed society\u2019s perspective. It has altered the historical paradigm from a focus on a health status to be cured or rehabilitated, and even pitied, towards acceptance of individual differences as human traits that are accommodated in employment, and generally in society, as a natural part of the human experience.\nThe Social Model of disability has taken on exceptional importance due to the health and economic emergency arising from the global pandemic [19, 20]. The pandemic is challenging public and private entities in unprecedented ways to spur both traditional and new forms of employment and economic opportunity for all. But people with disabilities are presently experiencing among the highest rates of job loss, as compared to those without disabilities, from the health and economic emergency [21, 22].\nLest we forget, too, people with disabilities often own or identify with multiple minority identities that are themselves marginalized in our society. People with disabilities, for example, may also be women, people of color, and/or individuals identifying with different sexual orientations and gender identities [23,24,25].

The special issue explores theoretical approaches, foundations and issues in the study of accessible tourism from a futures perspective. Accessible tourism, as with any area of academic study is an evolving field of academic research and industry practice, set within a dynamic social context. The field is interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary, and is influenced by geography, ageing and disability studies, economics, public policy, psychology, law, architecture, construction sciences, technology and marketing. Past research has attempted to view, explain and unpack the inherent complexities (Darcy, 2010) within accessible tourism through a variety of lenses, including human rights, critical tourism, embodiment, customer segmentation and universal design (UD), to name a few (see Buhalis and Darcy, 2011; Buhalis et al., 2012). The special issue is timely given the operationalisation of the United Nations (2006) Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities by 160 countries. Central to the convention is the right for tourists with disability to access transport and built environment in Article 9 and tourism experiences, goods and services within Article 30. It is therefore pertinent to look at the future of accessible tourism and contemplate a number of issues including (but not limited to) the role of technology in reshaping disability; if and how policy makers and planners are addressing the impact of accessible tourism in a sustainable manner; the political influence of people with disabilities, who make up the largest minority group in the USA, on the future of tourism; the science fiction of exoskeletons and gene therapy as a new form of adventure tourist; and the future state of embodied identity and accessible tourism. The special issue provides the opportunity for contributors to take part in the current discourses on accessible tourism from a futures perspective, in order that we can understand, manage and contribute to the development of accessible tourism in the context of economically, socially and environmentally sustainable communities. Specific topics included conceptual and research papers, viewpoints and trend papers, both qualitative and quantitative, discussing topics relating to the future of accessible tourism. Papers include a range of issues including: inclusive destinations; accessible tourism in Development Planning (toward the UN Sustainable Development Goals 2030); policy-making for accessible tourism; embodiment; representation; law and legislation; architecture and universal design; inclusion/exclusion from experiences; markets and needs analysis; accessible transport; accessible events; accessibility and culture/heritage; accessible accommodation; education/training; and technology and applications. In contrast to the past 30 years, where disability and tourism research has been largely concerned with overcoming barriers that exclude certain people (see Smith, 1987), we can discern the contours of new movements in accessible tourism, whereby overarching principles and standards of sustainability, social responsibility and customer service. The delivery of equitable tourism experiences demand the attention of sector actors and stakeholders. Accessible tourism, in this context, should be seen in the future as much more than a range of supports to excluded target groups, becoming a set of ground rules and codes of practice which contribute to the development of all tourism offers and destinations in an inclusive way. If we should gaze into the crystal ball for a moment, we could envisage that tourism will not be defined primarily in terms of different target groups, since principles of responsibility, sustainability and accessibility will in the future inform the quality criteria to which all destinations should comply and be judged as part of destination competitiveness in increasingly global context. Customers will become more aware of their individual rights and also the need to protect and sustain communities and the natural environment, influencing tourism service providers to follow generally accepted rules of service quality, genuine interactivity and engagement with the local culture, people and resources. The capability of tourism providers to recognise those rights for all (e.g. of tourists with disabilities, Design for All, responsible behaviour, inclusion of the local communities in a transparent system of remuneration and participation, working opportunities for socially excluded group etc.) is going to be the threshold, which determines whether their offers will succeed or fail in the future. The tourism sector will increasingly be seen as having transformational power as \u201ca shaper of society\u201d, acting as a promoter of jobs and economic growth, a participant in regional and community planning and a partner in global development programmes. In addition, tourism should be developed as industry that promotes understanding, inclusion and well-being for all in an equitable way. Businesses, destinations and networks, that are already active in the field of accessible tourism and/or representing markets with different specific requirements will participate more widely in the mainstream, bringing their expertise and knowledge to bear on all those issues that are still seen as \u201cdifferent types of tourism\u201d. In the development of accessible destinations and experiences, the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (2015) will be playing an increasingly supportive role, especially through its Global Code for Ethics in Tourism and the recently published Manuals on Accessible Tourism (2015), produced by ONCE Foundation and the European Network for Accessible Tourism (2015b). Before discussing the papers that have been selected for publication we would like to set the scene by examining some major conceptual and policy development areas that we believe will have a significant influence on accessible tourism futures in the future. These include: dreams and aspirations of people with disability; demography; UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; destination competitiveness frameworks; UD; and the newly adopted UN Sustainable Development Goals for 2030. Each of these areas of influence will now be outlined prior to the papers for the special edition being summarised for their contribution to the future of accessible tourism.\nDefining and conceptualising accessible tourism Conceptualising accessible tourism to reflect all its dimensions and multidisciplinarity is critical for the future. The study of tourism and disability has been a reasonably recent phenomenon with the first detailed examination emerging from the leisure constraints literature (Smith, 1987). From this beginning, a great deal of individual studies are emerged that documented significant issues with demand, supply and coordination of travel for people with disability. More recently the field has started to mature with a conceptualisation that has sought to make sense out of the individual studies and provide an overall framework for understanding the phenomena. To assist with this conceptualisation, Buhalis and Darcy (2011) offer the following definition: Accessible tourism is a form of tourism that involves collaborative processes between stakeholders that enables people with access requirements, including mobility, vision, hearing and cognitive dimensions of access, to function independently and with equity and dignity through the delivery of universally designed tourism products, services and environments. This definition adopts a whole of life approach where people through their lifespan benefit from accessible tourism provision. These include people with permanent and temporary disabilities, seniors, obese, families with young children and those working in safer and more socially sustainably designed environments (adapted from Darcy and Dickson, 2009, p. 34 in Buhalis and Darcy, 2011, pp. 10-11). Importantly the definition recognises collaboration between stakeholders across demand, supply and coordination to recognise that disability is a complex construct involving mobility, vision, hearing, cognitive and other embodiments. The definition recognises that developing inclusive destinations and accessible tourism experiences also benefit other groups in the community. Hence, it contributes toward a greater social sustainability of the industry by including and, hence, providing for a much broader cross-section of consumers that has previously been considered by the industry. In understanding the importance of individuals with disability, the stakeholders they engage with and the influence of UD on the products, services and environments they wish to seek enabling experiences. Buhalis and Darcy (2011) suggests that to develop accessible tourism futures destination managers must strategically plan through the lens of UD. Figure 1 outlines the cyclical strategic approach to engaging UD approaches across disability and lifespan considerations as a foundation for developing future accessible destination experiences.\nDreams and aspirations of people with disability The dreams and aspirations of individuals play a fundamental role in shaping the choices, which lead them to travel. Among people who live with a disability, the idea of leaving behind one\u2019s everyday surroundings and going on a journey can create significant anxiety (Darcy, 1998). People with disability often can design or influence their everyday environment whilst they have routines to negotiate any difficulties and thresholds that exist. This does not apply to new environments whilst travelling, where they do not have prior knowledge, networks or influence on the design nor the potential barriers that are to face and the way to overcome them. Indeed, a recent European survey (GfK, 2015) suggests that up to half of people with disability do not travel on holiday, due to a combination of lack of reliable information, lack of funds and previous bad experiences. Yet, the desire to travel remains with studies showing that it is not a person\u2019s impairment that impedes their travel but a series of interpersonal, attitudinal structural constraints (Daniels et al., 2005; Darcy, 2003). In recognising that a person's impairment does not constrain their travel motivations, the boundaries to what is regarded as accessible tourism destinations and experiences are continually pushed by the accessible explorers who forge new pathways for others to follow.\nMillennium development goals (MDGs) and the UN global compact At the Millennium Summit in September 2000 the largest gathering of world leaders in history adopted the UN Millennium Declaration, committing their nations to a global partnership to reduce extreme poverty and setting a series of targets, with a deadline of 2015. These targets, known as the MDGs are a set of eight specific goals set by the 191 United Nations member countries that have the goal of halving world poverty by the year 2015: Eradicating extreme poverty continues to be one of the main challenges of our time, and is a major concern of the international community. Ending this scourge will require the combined efforts of all, governments, civil society organizations and the private sector, in the context of a stronger and more effective global partnership for development. The Millennium Development Goals set timebound targets, by which progress in reducing income poverty, hunger, disease, lack of adequate shelter and exclusion \u2013 while promoting gender equality, health, education and environmental sustainability \u2013 can be measured. They also embody basic human rights \u2013 the rights of each person on the planet to health, education, shelter and security. The Goals are ambitious but feasible and, together with the comprehensive United Nations development agenda, set the course for the world\u2019s efforts to alleviate extreme poverty by 2015 (United Nations Secretary-General BAN Ki-moon). The aim of the MDGs is to encourage development by improving social and economic conditions in the world\u2019s poorest countries. Since the MDG\u2019s were agreed to significant progress has been made. To date average overall incomes have increased by approximately 21 per cent. The number of people living in extreme poverty declined by an estimated 130 million. Chile mortality rates fell from 103 deaths per 1,000 live births a year to 88. Life expectancy rose from 63 years to 65 years. An additional 8 per cent of the developing world\u2019s people received access to clean water and an additional 15 per cent acquired access to improved sanitation services. In 2015 the UN countries will adopt a new sustainable development agenda and a new global agreement on climate change. The actions taken in 2015 are expected to result in new sustainable development goals that build on the eight MDG\u2019s (United Nations, 2015). Tourism has long been seen as having significant potential to help achieve the MDG\u2019s in developing countries. For example in 1990 developing countries had 18 per cent of international tourism receipts. By 2005 this had risen to 30 per cent and to date it continues to rise. There has been significant promotion of the direct economic links between tourists and the poor. Tourism may provide employment opportunities for marginalised groups, may bring direct income to individual communities and may promote equality in developing countries (Saarinen and Rogerson, 2013).\nUD supports destination competitiveness The tourism industry needs to design and deliver offerings and services that are suitable to all potential users and remove any physical or organisational barriers that can prevent visitation. UD incorporates the accessibility requirements of people with the widest possible range of abilities, so that the greatest number of people can use mainstream products and services without the need for adaptations or special interfaces. Additionally, mainstream products and services should use interface standards which match those of technical aids, so allowing disabled people to access and use mainstream equipment. UD has been defined as: Universal design is the design of products and environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design. The intent of the universal design concept is to simplify life for everyone by making products, communications, and the built environment more usable by more people at little or no extra cost. The universal design concept targets all people of all ages, sizes and abilities\u2019. The Universal Design approach goes beyond traditional design, which tends to focus on the \u2018average\u2019 user. Universal Design is a design approach, reflecting a way of understanding people\u2019s needs. It is not a list of particular solutions, measurements, or products \u2013 Universal Design is the way to reach the solution, contributing to social inclusion (cited in Center for Universal Design, 2009; and first articulated by Mace, 1985). Applying the principles of UD can be seen as a way of developing tourism environments, transportation, services and offers, underpinning sustainable communities and businesses. Today, according to a recent study by European Network for Accessible Tourism (2015a) and partners, less than 10 per cent of tourism suppliers in Europe offer \u201caccessible\u201d tourism services, while demand for such services is set to increase due to the ageing population and continuing upward trend in market demand. Adopting UD enlarges the target markets of destinations as well as ensures that more pleasant experiences can be delivered. Therefore it can increase the market base, reduce seasonality and support the competitiveness of destinations (Buhalis, 2000). Yet, few studies have examined accessible tourism in relation to destination management and only recently has accessible tourism been examined from destination competitiveness perspective (Dom\u00ednguez Vila et al., 2015).\nPapers in this issue To address these concepts and developments this special issue is bringing a range of papers together that discuss research on many accessibility tourism aspects. Naniopoulos and Tsalis (2015) discuss a methodology for addressing the accessibility of monuments. They focus on heritage attraction sites, highlighting the challenges with archaeological sites where interventions become problematic or even impossible. In doing so, they approached accessibility as a dual notion; accessibility of an area and its potential for independent physical access and movement around the monuments as well as perceived accessibility in terms of interpreting, understanding and learning from the environment. The methodology was applied to a number of byzantine monuments as part of a cultural route in the city of Thessaloniki in Greece, as case studies. Results provide both tools for assessing monument accessibility (process orientations and checklists) and insights into the needs of travellers with disabilities for more \u201cusable\u201d heritage attractions. Concluding remarks place a focus on the prerequisites of training and cooperation to allow for the future of accessible monuments to be realised. Tsalis et al. (2015) provide an interesting study on the challenges of implementing accessibility solutions, also within the context of protection, conservation, and management of historical centres and monuments. Viewed from a tourism perspective, archaeological sites and monuments are location bound and exist only in their original place. Hence, access to such sites enables unique and authentic tourism experiences. Discourses on objective, constructive and existential authenticity are of paramount importance when accessibility is concerned. This study provides relevant examples of accessibility interventions on six monuments as well as considerations on the design of the tools that assisted site interpretation and interconnection in a cultural route. Results demonstrate how accessibility improvements can occur while respecting the history, architecture and character of the monuments. The study concludes by emphasizing that it is primarily through providing greater access, that the \u201csocialisation\u201d of these monuments will propagate authentic tourism experiences in the future. Bowtell (2015) offers an examination of the market value and attractiveness of accessible tourism in Europe. Historic data were used to provide a forecast for 2025, while primary data obtained from travel and leisure companies provided insights into managerial perceptions. Findings show a very promising potential for accessible tourism market with significant projected revenues. However, a number of challenges including lack of awareness, cost of investments, complexity of customers\u2019 needs and legal inconsistencies within the EU, create barriers toward developing comprehensive solutions for accessible tourism. Authors provide recommendations on bridging demand and supply. Gillovic and McIntosh (2015) present an interesting study on stakeholder perspectives of the future of accessible tourism in New Zealand. The study provides insights into the current situation and the future propensity for an accessible tourism industry in New Zealand. A number of interviews with key stakeholders revealed that there is a need to develop a culture of accessibility that is perceived as the norm. Findings also include the business and demand arguments, but additionally highlighted the \u201cineptness\u201d of upper industry levels to recognize the opportunity of accessible tourism, exhibiting apathy and complacency instead. Authors conclude with recommendations for the future of accessible tourism in New Zealand which can easily be generalised for other regions. Zajadacz (2015) discusses the evolution of models of disability as a basis for the future development of accessible tourism. A review of medical, social, biopsychosocial, geographical and economic models of disability reveals the theoretical underpinnings and assumptions entailed in those. These are then linked to tourism, demonstrating that different models influence the tourism provision in terms of both products and services. Authors highlight the understanding of disability under different models toward diverse tourism experiences. Several suggestions are offered on the complementary of the models and the implications on the transformation of the accessible tourism industry in the future. Cruces Portales (2015) uses a scenario planning approach to envisage alternative futures for accessible tourism. With a timeframe leading to 2050, four alternative futures are unravelled through storytelling. The scenarios are built on a matrix that includes the opposing forces of empathy \u2013 apathy, and fear of loss and certainty of benefits. The resulting, aptly named scenarios (Eden Gardens, Golden Bridge, Wasted Future and State of Hope) showcase different behaviours, schedules of changes and insights. Authors conclude with strategic ideas and proposals for the future of accessible tourism.\nConclusion When exploring the future of tourism in this area two opposing trends can be observed: future societies are predicted to become more similar, more homogenous as a consequence of consumerism, globalisation and converging urban lifestyles. However, the accessible tourism market is characteristically diverse, with complex needs and the range of dreams and ambitions is boundless. Will future global travellers be able to access more varied and personal services or will increasing numbers of travellers give rise to greater standardization of services? Accessible tourism as an emerging field of study will influence tourism destination competitiveness in the future, whether that be from a human rights, emerging market segment or service delivery perspective. In this conceptual examination, we have presented implications of number of theoretical constructs and lenses through which accessible tourism will be influenced in the future. In this special issue, a number of future dimensions are explored that demonstrate how the field has moved from an examination of the intersection of disability and tourism, to one that is clearly defined through conceptual and definitional approaches as accessible tourism. There is a common thread amongst all the papers presented in this special issue. They focus around stakeholder collaboration, as a foundation for the future development of accessible tourism. It has been explicitly suggested that raising awareness amongst stakeholders is essential to overcome barriers inhibiting the application of solutions that enhance access. The importance of stakeholder collaboration across the accessible tourism value chain has been emphasized in a number of ways in this special issue. Improving accessibility of facilities, transportation, attractions and destinations more generally, demands the collaboration of a wide range of stakeholders including architects, designers, economists, local councils, policy makers, travellers with disabilities, historians and archaeologists to name a few. Therefore \u201csocialising\u201d tourism means that access can be granted only when a number of relevant stakeholders are in accord, work together and specifically developed strategies to target the accessible tourism market. Stakeholder collaboration is a key factor for developing accessible tourism solutions, recognising the value of the market and capitalising on it. Hence, a collaborative approach is required to recognise the complementary nature of the different paradigms; to re-shape and transform the future of the accessible tourism through influencing the tourism industry, contributing government organisations and the not-for-profit sectors. The strength and depth of stakeholder collaborations will determine alternative future realities; from a future where all cooperate and share benefits for all parties, to a fatalistic picture where each stakeholder is sailing alone because they consider their interests incompatible, and everything in between. UD should provide a better accessible tourism future that should enhance the competitiveness of tourism destinations and organisations."}, {"title": "Tourism Accessibility for Impaired", "article": "\u201cI have a wife and three children. If I can\u2019t use a product or service, then the business loses not only one person\u2019s business, but five.\u201d\nAs seen in the above quote, Martin Heng emphasizes that people with disabilities and people with different access needs do travel, and are likely to travel with others. And these travelers represent, according to the Amadeus Accessibility Study, a \"$70 billion market\" just in Europe and the USA.\nThis fact alone would make a strong business case for investing time, effort, and resources needed to become more accessible and inclusive as a business and as an industry. But beyond the economic imperative, there are important reasons for the tourism industry to take this segment seriously.\nBelow are some ideas and insights on how and why we should promote not just accessibility, but also inclusive tourism that benefits everyone as well as relevant industry resources for tourism businesses and destinations seeking to better understand accessible and inclusive tourism, and to improve their practices. Parts of the content featured here have been inspired by and based on Martin's presentation (originally recorded on July 18th, 2019 as part of the GSTC Sustainable Tourism Training Online Course).\nTourism for All: Including As Many Different Groups As Possible\nContrary to what many might think, accessible tourism is not just about providing facilities that are wheel-chair accessible.\nSenior travelers. Parents traveling with small kids. Travelers with allergies and other medical conditions. These are all different types of travelers who have different degrees of accessibility restrictions and mobility requirements.\nAnd a large proportion of travelers with disabilities have \"invisible\" impairments (such as cognitive or mental health conditions and long-term illnesses) that may not be, unlike wheelchair users, immediately obvious just by looking at them.\nWhen planning for and communicating about the accessibility features and services you provide, therefore, rather than simply using the \"handicap symbol\" (the ubiquitously used sign of a wheelchair user - the top-left pictogram on the above image), these various areas of accessibility needs must be considered and appropriately indicated.\nShare on your website and brochures, for example, if you provide assistive listening devices on your tour, or if sign language interpretation is available within any of the attractions you visit.\n\"Tourism for All\" is a concept that is addressing a growing segment of travelers with a diverse range of needs and requirements. What is \"accessible\" to one traveler who is a wheelchair user, for example, may be very difficult to access or completely inaccessible to another traveler with a different type of disability, mobility impairment or other conditions.\nThat's why becoming more inclusive is a more appropriate goal for the tourism industry than focusing just on \"accessible tourism\" (which can be vague and hard to define - accessible for whom?).\nAn inclusive tourism business or destination works to offer positive travel experiences to people with different needs by addressing them from various perspectives, and by providing design and service solutions that aim to cover as many different groups as possible.\nUniversal Design: Designing for Everyone, Being a Good Host\nWhen it comes to being inclusive and promoting Tourism for All, a key concept that underlies the solutions to be implement by tourism businesses and destinations is Universal Design.\nThe definition of Universal Design is as follows:\nUniversal Design is the design and composition of an environment so that it can be accessed, understood and used to the greatest extent possible by all people regardless of their age, size, ability or disability. An environment (or any building, product, or service in that environment) should be designed to meet the needs of all people who wish to use it. This is not a special requirement, for the benefit of only a minority of the population. It is a fundamental condition of good design. If an environment is accessible, usable, convenient and a pleasure to use, everyone benefits.\n- Centre for Excellence in Universal Design, \" What is Universal Design\nTo understand where you need to improve in order to offer universally accessible experience for everyone's benefit, take some time to reflect on the whole customer journey from the perspectives of guests with different access needs and mobility requirements.\nThink about how they experience travel - from the customer finding your business, to booking their trip, to arriving in your destination, to getting around during their stay.\nAre there steps to enter the restaurant that will make it difficult for customers with limited mobility? Does your hotel offer an accessible and easy-to-follow process for guests with disabilities to check in/out and get around within the property? And is your website designed for users with different needs (e.g. individuals with hearing or vision impairment)?\nBusinesses often have barriers that make it difficult for customers with particular access or mobility impairments to enjoy a certain product or service, because of the lack of awareness that those barriers exist.\nAnd in some cases, businesses may be \"rejecting\" prospective customers without ever knowing. The 2016 Click-Away Pound study found that \"71% of customers with access needs will click away from a website that they find difficult to use\".\nWith all the different types of accessibility requirements, it may seem difficult or impossible to anticipate and accommodate the various needs of your customers. But it's important to remember that in tourism we are in the business of providing services to welcome guests; and that it is in fact your responsibility as a host to cater to the needs of your guests and to make them feel welcome.\nIt's part of being a good host.\nBy considering the diverse needs and abilities of all throughout the design process, universal design creates products, services and environments that meet peoples' needs. Simply put, universal design is good design. - Centre for Excellence in Universal Design, \"What is Universal Design\"\nInclusive Growth and Sustainable Development\nWith the growing importance of the accessible tourism market, and especially the spending power of this market segment including the \"multiplier effect\" (each traveler with impairment is likely to influence the purchase decisions of multiple members of their party), there is a strong economic imperative to be considered. To remain competitive, your tourism business and destination should be investing in universal design and inclusive solutions.\nBeyond the economic imperative, however, there are also key reasons why inclustive tourism should be part of the global sustainable tourism agenda.\nWith an estimated 15% of the world population living with some forms of disabilities (World Health Organization, World Report on Disability 2011), and the changing demographic of the \"rapidly ageing\" populations around the world (WHO, Aging and Life Course), sustainable development can only be achieved through an inclusive approach to creating solutions and opportunities.\nThe United Nations' \"Disability and Development Report: Realizing the Sustainable Development Goals by, for and with persons with disabilities\" (2018) recognizes that \"striving to achieve disability-inclusive development is not only the right thing to do, it is also the practical thing to do,\" as \"the success of the 2030 Agenda requires a participatory and inclusive approach in which all stakeholders, including persons with disabilities, are engaged.\"\nAnd that's why Tourism for All is highlighted in the Global Sustainable Tourism Criteria, the baseline standard for sustainability in travel and tourism.\nSource: Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC)\nAnd in the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO)'s Global Code of Ethics for Tourism.\nSource: UNWTO, Global Code of Ethics for Tourism\nInclusion in the Work Place\nHaving understood the importance of striving for universal design and working towards becoming more inclusive, what can tourism businesses do to get started? What are some of the first steps?\nOne of the key challenges when considering steps to becoming more inclusive is to understand the diverse needs of your customers and your prospective customers. The barriers that prevent some people from having a positive travel experience - whether they may be steps that cannot be climbed, signs that cannot be read, or buttons that cannot be reached - are hard to notice unless you put yourself in the position of those with particular disabilities and impairments.\nOne of the most effective ways for businesses to understand the various accessibility needs of their customers is to have team members who know and represent the perspectives of those customers. In short, hire people with disabilities. Empower them to help make your business more inclusive, both within your operations and through your products and services.\nThe UNWTO report \"Recommendations on Accessible Tourism\" (2013) states that \"the staff of tourism establishments and related services should be prepared to know, understand and address the needs of customers with disabilities\", and \"the staff should include employees who know how to communicate with persons with sensory disabilities.\"\n\"The hospitality industry serves travellers from all over the world. The diversity of cultures implies a diversity of customer expectations as well. The hotels with a diverse workforce to cater to such a wide customer base hold a strong competitive advantage over others. ... [To] have employees that understand the needs and requirements of the customers and provide key insights into making properties progressively accessible is also a crucial element of the overall business strategy.\" - Hospitality Workers Training Centre, \"Disability Inclusion in the Hospitality Industry Makes Business Sense\"\nBusiness Examples: Staff Diversity and Inclusion\nLemon Tree Hotels Limited, India\nWinner of the 2019 Tourism for Tomorrow Awards, in the category \"Investing in People\", Lemon Tree Hotels have focused on creating a socially inclusive work environment, bringing together people of different backgrounds, abilities and ethnicities to work as a unified team with a common goal.

Experiencing a voyage on Tenacious (or her sister ship Lord Nelson) is an object lesson in the benefits of inclusion and accessibility.

This paper intends to advance available knowledge on this issue by conceptually suggesting a solution that draws on the concepts of the tourism experience and digital ecosystems.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020, Fabio Cassia, Paola Castellani, Chiara Rossato and Claudio Baccarani\nPublished by Emerald Publishing Limited.

Tourism experience and tourism ecosystem from perspective of tourists with mobility disability 4.1 Mapping the tourism experience through the tourism customer journey The tourism customer journey (TCJ) involves mapping the entire journey of a tourist, outlining all the stages a person goes through when experiencing the need to move for tourism purposes (\u00c5str\u00f8m, 2020). The TCJ draws on the more general concept of the customer journey, which is the \u201cprocess a customer goes through, across all stages and touch points, that makes up the customer experience\u201d (Lemon and Verhoef, 2016, p. 71). Mapping customer journeys is a popular and effective way to grasp the entire tourism customer experience (Rosenbaum et al., 2017). If the tourism product as a whole was offered by one single company, the general customer journey concept could be easily applied to tourism in the same way as it is applied to other kinds of services (e.g. banking, retail and insurance services). However, as will be discussed shortly, tourism is a more complex service because of the number and variety of co-creating actors and the relationships amongst them. Here, we apply the TCJ to the context of people with mobility disability. A similar analysis could be applied to people with other disabilities (Al\u00e9n et al., 2012), resulting in different and specific types of TCJs. Given the complexity of applying a contextual study to all types of disabilities, this study focusses only on people with mobility disability, but the same method of analysis could be easily extended and replicated. From the very beginning of the TCJ, even when individuals are planning their holiday, they will encounter a series of actors, whose number will dramatically increase in the subsequent stages of the journey (Buhalis, 2000; Saraniemi and Kyl\u00e4nen, 2011). This is because tourism involves a complex ecosystem that has many actors who influence to a greater or lesser extent the experience perceived by individuals during their journey (Gretzel et al., 2016). The quality delivered by each actor clearly influences the overall quality of the tourist's overall experience (Ciasullo, 2017). Sometimes this phenomenon is emphasised because the quality performance of one provider has a spillover effect on the customer's evaluation of the quality performance of other components of (or actors in) the tourism ecosystem (Bourdeau et al., 2007). That is, a negative performance in one part of the journey may have a negative halo effect on the entire journey, considering that the tourist (beyond being the focal actor of the ecosystem) (Storbacka et al., 2016) is the only actor to see all the components of the ecosystem. Similarly, a positive performance in one of the moments of truth (Normann, 2001) has the potential to compensate for a series of negative performances in other parts of the journey. Overall, there is a remarkable risk of tourist dissatisfaction, which is heightened when the person undertaking the journey has some form of disabilities, such as when they have reduced mobility. These arguments can be illustrated through the construction of the TCJ for a holiday that is independently conceived and designed by a person with mobility disability who has time to spend in a destination to be selected and does not want to rely on standardised offerings delivered by tour operators. For this purpose, we draw on the general framework suggested by Baccarani and Cassia (2017), according to which a holiday is articulated and occurs in the following four main stages (Figure 1): destination choice and trip design; outbound trip; staying at the destination; transfer to another destination or return home. Each of the four stages of the TCJ develops through the processes that are outlined below. The points marked with the sign (*) in the following list represent critical aspects for people with mobility disability because they can entail various problems related to accessibility because of the presence of architectural, communication, cultural, technological and relational barriers. The first stage of the TCJ \u2013 destination choice and trip design \u2013 encompasses the formation of a tourist's experiential expectations drawing on the following elements: time available for the journey, motivations triggering the need for the journey, any previous personal holiday experiences, any previous indirect holiday experiences (e.g. information collected online, online reviews and e-word-of-mouth), dialogue and interactions with disability organisations and associations, information available online or printed specialised magazines and publications, information available in promotional materials delivered by tourism destinations, means of transportation available and reservation of such transportation (*), type of accommodations available and reservation of such lodgings (*), definition of a hierarchy of suitable destinations (*). The second stage of the TCJ \u2013 outbound trip \u2013 covers the most complex part of the holiday. In fact, the anticipated benefits of the planned holiday take shape during this stage. In the case that the tourist uses a personally owned means of transport suitable for their disability to reach the boarding point and that the travel is done by aeroplane, this stage includes the following elements: printing the boarding pass, estimating the time that they must leave home to reach the airport (this estimation is informed by customers' sensitivity to risk and the information available), preparing their luggage, planning which road or highways to take to reach the airport, stopping at rest areas to meet their needs or the needs of others or to comply with the requirements of the transport providers (*), parking in an area near the airport (*), checking in their luggage (*), reaching the boarding point (*), complying with any safety control procedures (*), waiting at a boarding gate (*), boarding the aeroplane (*), flying to the destination (*), disembarking and claiming their luggage (*), searching for a local means of transport to reach the accommodation facility (*), arriving and being welcomed at the accommodation facility (*). The third stage of the TCJ \u2013 staying at the destination \u2013 represents the core of the holiday with all that a person desired for their time away on holiday. This is a stage of personal enhancement in relation to seeking knowledge, values and relationships. During this stage, the core value of the holiday emerges and is influenced, at least in the beginning, by the travel experience, which may increase or diminish the initial enthusiasm. This stage encompasses the following points and involves a variety of actors at the destination: planning itineraries, visits and activities that the tourists wish to engage in at the destination based on their previous knowledge and the information available to them, visiting cultural, artistic and natural sites in an area (*), forming relationships with the host community (*), selecting from a variety of foods and eateries on offer (*), participating in local guided tours (e.g. wine tours) (*), using local means of transport (*), purchasing souvenirs. The fourth stage of the TCJ \u2013 transfer to another place or return back home \u2013 is similar to stages two and three described above, and includes the overall evaluation of the perceived quality in relation to the expected quality developed in stage one. In addition to the steps described above, which imply a variety of relationships between the tourist and several different actors, the context of a holiday is even more complex because tourist safety and care must be specifically assured, particularly for PwD. These conditions must be guaranteed by higher-level welfare systems, with which the tourism service network should be able to cooperate effectively. In summary, in this TCJ the tourist benefits from a variety of services that globally support the creation of the tourism experience, which is phenomenologically determined and perceived by the beneficiary (i.e. the tourist) (Vargo and Lusch, 2016). 4.2 Identifying the tourism ecosystem in relation to tourists with mobility disability This subsection identifies the actors that form the complex tourism ecosystem in its co-creation of the tourism experience. During each of the four stages of the TCJ, many different actors contribute to the formation of the overall tourist experience by delivering or not delivering the expected quality. In the tourist's experience, all these actors form a tourism service ecosystem, even if they represent only a set of services that the customer has assembled (Baccarani and Cassia, 2017). In fact, a service ecosystem implies a self-contained, self-adjusting system of resource-integrating actors connected by shared institutional arrangements and mutual value creation (Vargo and Lusch, 2016). However, this level of coordination amongst all the actors involved in the co-creation of tourism experience does not yet exist. Below, we outline the actors involved in each of the four stages of the TCJ. In the first stage, the tourist imagines, designs, plans and anticipates the pleasure of their holiday. To complete this stage, the tourist relies on the information provided by actors such as airlines and accommodation providers and interact with them directly or through intermediaries. For people with mobility disability, the dialogue and interactions with disability organisations and associations play an important role. As highlighted by the UNWTO, disabled peoples' organisations (DPOs) play a key role in accessible tourism because \u201cthey are mediators in understanding specific needs, existent barriers and the ways to bridge them\u201d (UNWTO, 2020). At this first stage of the TCJ (destination choice and trip design), quality is evaluated on the basis of the completeness and clarity of the information provided by multiple actors. All the actors involved in this first stage of the TCJ represent the holiday-design ecosystem (see Figure 3). In the second stage of the TCJ (outbound trip), at least the following 12 actors are involved, and this number could be even higher if a tourist decides to use public means of transport (instead of a personally owned means on transport): producers of publications or websites and intermediaries distributing information that guides the tourist in selecting the destination during the season in which the journey takes place; booking organisations through their websites; transport providers, including those preparing the service timetable; highways operators who have information about roadworks and any related delays; firms executing the roadworks who have information about any interruptions that may affect the roadworks and travel times; firms managing the rest areas and a variety of other services that may be required; firms managing the parking areas who may assist customers to reach their boarding point after having parked their vehicle; airport company that manages the departure airport that offers a welcome service and controls safety processes; airline that is responsible for checking in passengers, assigning boarding gates, flying times and delivering baggage; airport company that manages the arrival airport that offers welcome services and provides information to customers and about local means of transport; local transport service operators; accommodation services providers. Therefore, a tourist interacts with at least 12 different co-creating actors during the second stage of the TCJ. These actors are connected in the tourist's mind but they are practically linked only through market relations and they do not coordinate their decisions and behaviours. Thus, it is unlikely that the tourist will be able to complete the second stage without experiencing some level of difficulty. For example, the tourist may miss the flight because of planned roadwork not being properly notified in advance or because of other unforeseen events. To evaluate the quality of the overall experience, the tourist considers all the components of this stage of the TCJ, comparing expected and actual quality. In particular, the tourist will appreciate the problem-solving capability of the actors. This second group of actors represents the travel ecosystem (see Figure 3). In the third stage of the TCJ (staying at the destination), the tourist stays at the chosen destination where they interact with at least the following actors: firms who manage welcome and accommodation services; restaurateurs; local inhabitants (local community); local transport service operators; local merchants with their value propositions; agencies who organise local tours so that customers can explore local traditions, culture and products; municipalities; organisations protecting tourists' safety and care. This third stage of the TCJ has fewer actors than the second stage. However, the variety of actors is greater because during the tourist's stay at the destination, the tourist will engage in activities such as trying different types of food offerings to appreciate the local food culture, which means they will have contact and engage with more actors. Similarly, to explore local artistic, natural and cultural heritage, the tourist will select from a variety of opportunities that are available at the destination. In the third stage of the TCJ, the local community also plays a fundamental role in welcoming tourists and in co-creating their tourism experiences. In fact, in addition to the technical and functional\u2013relational components of the quality delivered by local services (Gr\u00f6nroos, 1990; Kang and James, 2004), the welcoming atmosphere experienced at the destination plays a central role in the formation of the overall perceived quality (Nunkoo and Ramkissoon, 2011). All the actors involved in the third stage of the TCJ represent the staying at destination ecosystem (see Figure 3). The fourth stage (transfer to another place or return back home) is a replication of the stages two and three outlined above and encompasses the tourist's comparison between the overall perceived quality and the expected quality developed in stage one. The actors that populate the tourism service ecosystem are largely the same for tourists with and without disabilities. However, tourists with disabilities can select amongst a smaller number of offerings than tourists without disabilities. Moreover, actors are required to have adequate technical and relational skills to deliver tourism services to tourists with disabilities. Thus, tourists with disabilities must face greater difficulties in their travel-related choices because of the presence of several types of barriers (see Figure 2). The tourism ecosystem described in this sub-section is depicted in Figure 3. The quality of the tourism experience emerges from the relationships established within this tourism ecosystem through which resources are combined and value is co-created. Such relationships have different degrees of smoothness depending on the presence of several barriers.\n5. Barriers to accessible tourism: can digital ecosystems represent a solution? Drawing on the arguments developed so far, this section identifies in detail the barriers to fulfilling tourism experience co-creation for PwD. The intention of the discussion is to understand whether and how digital ecosystems could represent a viable solution to such barriers. The identified relationships amongst the co-creating actors have not been harmonised to deliver the overall quality desired by the tourist because they are regulated by pure competitive mechanisms, emphasising the value of a specific part of the ecosystem instead of the value of the entire ecosystem. However, in tourism, competition amongst companies of the same sector can exist only once a territory as a whole is attractive. As highlighted in several studies (Baccarani et al., 2019; Barnes, 2004), the territory is not a physical space, but a highly complex viable subject emerging from all co-creations over time through the interactions between nature and human beings. Thus, the territory emerges from the relational synergies between the people who inhabit it and the environment. Therefore, the stronger the synergies established in a certain location, the higher the location's attractiveness and value, which then make the location a platform in which individual actors can compete against each other with their propositions. That is, the long-term attractiveness of a territory and of a tourism destination derives from the actions of the entire ecosystem, within which the actors must aim to do their best through a continuous dialogue with the territorial ecosystem. For this purpose, tourism must be conceived in a holistic manner by deploying planning efforts that involve all the actors of the ecosystem and engage all the potential beneficiaries of the tourism offering \u2013 be they are tourists with or without disabilities (Darcy et al., 2020). This perspective cannot ignore a series of barriers that determine biases in the co-creation of a location that provides tourism services for all tourists and particularly for those with mobility disability. In detail, the following barriers to accessible tourism can be identified (Gillovic et al., 2018; Michopoulou et al., 2020; Nyanjom et al., 2018): informational barriers; architectural barriers; political barriers; cultural barriers; relational barriers; technological barriers; entrepreneurial myopia. These barriers are outlined below from the perspective of PwD. Informational barriers refer to the difficulties that a person with disabilities faces when desiring to autonomously evaluate and choose a means of transport, accommodation, a holiday itinerary or simple holiday activities such as shopping. While there is usually a great deal of information is available for such services, informational needs of PwD leads to higher levels of complexity. For example, even when information about tourism services is available it can difficult to verify. Architectural barriers refer to the obstacles PwD encounter on holiday when engaging in activities such as accessing means of transport, moving in different locations, and using sidewalks and roads. Inconveniences related to architectural barriers can often also be experienced by people without disabilities (e.g. finding it difficult to understand the subway system) but the barriers are emphasised for PwD. Architectural barriers are directly connected to political barriers, which refer to the needs of PwD in the context of a political agenda. While political discourses highlight the ideal of acting to eliminate architectural barriers, political actions are often guided by urgency, short-termism and narrow-sighted electoral benefits. Cultural barriers refer to the indifference that can characterise the behaviour of all people of all abilities (Gillovic et al., 2018) towards PwD. This barrier is manifest in factors such as the lack of respect for PwD parking slots. Relational barriers refer to the general population viewing PwD from a self-righteous perspective, believing that the PwD cannot live a full life, even within the constraints of the experienced impairments. Technological barriers refer to the speed of the technological change related to means of transport and communication, which can create difficult situations for those who do not keep up with the ongoing changes. Entrepreneurial myopia refers to the inability to appreciate the size and value of the tourism market for PwD and of changes occurring in public opinion. This myopia is in tension with the ideals of sustainability provided by Agenda 2030 (United Nations, 2015), which explicitly highlights the need to promote sustainability and inclusivity and to empower PwD (e.g. points 11 and 23 of Agenda 2030) and by the Global Code of Ethics for Tourism (UNWTO, 2001), which states the \u201cright to tourism\u201d (article 7). When accessible tourism experiences are designed, it is important to avoid ad-hoc solutions aimed exclusively at PwD (Scheyvens and Biddulph, 2018). Following the principles of universal design (Michopoulou et al., 2020), tourism providers should in fact enable experiences that are useable by all people, with or without disabilities. This approach is consistent with the idea that tourism carries a value that makes it a public service, interpreted as a service that should be assured for every member of communities that desire such services. The question now arises of the assessment of the potential of digital ecosystems to remove the identified barriers and enable effective accessible tourism experience co-creation. While it is clear that technology cannot solve all the problems, we contend that it represents a valuable engine for such effective co-creation. As noted by Akaka and Vargo (2014), technology should be conceived as an operant resource able to bring about changes in ecosystems and influence value co-creation processes. The provision of a platform to support the engagement of actors involved in accessible tourism can thus represent a first step to first removing informational and relational barriers, and over time, smoothening other barriers (e.g. cultural barriers). Thus, technology can enable the emergence of a digital ecosystem with tourists and their needs as the focal actors (Gretzel et al., 2015, 2016). Such an ecosystem could initially organise and coordinate suitable solutions to emerging PwD needs and issues by collecting and sharing the information concerning all the actors of the ecosystem. Given that tourism is a service provided by a specific territory, the digital ecosystem should be led by the authorities in charge at the territorial level, whether a municipality, province, region or country. Given that the emerging ecosystems require rapid efficiency and effectiveness checks, it seems more appropriate that the process begins at the local territorial level and then extended (through imitation and adaptations) to higher levels. Beyond authorities in charge at the territorial level, universities and other research institutes should play a central role in the design of a tourism ecosystem. These institutions should establish a dialogue with tourists, with PwD and with disability organisations and associations, without overlooking local inhabitants who are important for creating a warm and smooth welcoming. The emergence of the tourism ecosystem also draws on the constructive contributions of all the organisations representing the service providers who play a role in co-creating tourism experiences. The digital ecosystem should also be based on a series of incentives for firms that decide to be a part of the ecosystem, beyond a process of certification and evaluation of their delivered quality. As a good starting point, municipalities could establish tourism departments that have the additional responsibility for the removal of mobility barriers. The viability of this choice is demonstrated by the experience of Verona, the first (and currently the only) municipality in Italy that has introduced such a department. For smaller municipalities, the digital ecosystem could be created at a higher level, such as in a consortium of municipalities, a province or a region. Figure 2 presents the main features of the tourism digital ecosystem. Overall, the establishment of a digital ecosystem aims to make the territory an inclusive, warm and welcoming location where people want to live or stay. Hence, by providing an engagement platform, technology can act as an operant resource, disrupting the myopia guiding each actor's individual behaviours. An example of a digital ecosystem to support accessible tourism is the one being implemented by Explora, the destination management organisation of the Lombardy region (Italy). Explora has begun to establish a digital ecosystem (Ecosistema Digitale Turistico della Lombardia) through a platform that aims to support information sharing amongst the actors of Lombardy's tourism ecosystem. This ecosystem has not been created specifically to support accessible tourism. However, through this platform, operators could coordinate and harmonise the design of accessible tourism experiences, which would then be communicated and sold through the related web portal \u201cin-lombardia.it\u201d. This web portal currently hosts dozens of accessible tourism experiences; however, these are not conceived following the concept of the holistic ecosystem described in this paper. Nonetheless, the technological infrastructure that has been created has the ability to foster the future emergence of such a holistic accessible tourism ecosystem."}, {"title": "The World's Best Accessible Hotels", "article": "1\nIt starts with a booking\nIt starts with a booking\nThe only way to leave a review is to first make a booking.

This means that the hotel room is designed to accommodate individuals with reduced mobility or people with any kind of disability. It should be in the hands of the hotel to properly make their rooms within reach of all target audiences, whether your country makes it a requirement or not.\nIn this article, we\u2019ll look at what is an accessible hotel room and the eight elements that a hotel room must include in order to be able to be inclusive and accommodate any kind of guest.\nWhat is an accessible hotel room?\nWhile in a perfect world, all hotel rooms would be made to suit any kind of guest, the idea of an accessible hotel room is that there are special accommodations made for guests with any kind of disabilities, including individuals with impaired vision, those with hearing loss, and reduced mobility. This means that the room is designed while thinking about the needs of this kind of client so that they can move around in the room comfortably.\nIn some countries, like the United States, hotels are obligated to have a certain percentage of their rooms be accessible, across different floors and for different room types. This means that these rooms that are created for people with disabilities are required to include roll-in showers, toilets with bars on the sides, wide entryways to accommodate wheelchair maneuvering and other elements that we will discuss in more detail below.\nEight elements that accessible hotel rooms must include\nWhile there are many types of disabilities, as a hotelier, it is your responsibility to create an inclusive hotel that is welcoming to all individuals no matter their degree or kind of disability. This can be done by creating smart rooms that help use technology to make rooms more accessible with elements like voice technology. We will look at some of the key elements that these types of rooms must include so that they can be hospitable for all guests.\nVoice technology is an excellent tool to contribute to accessibility because this way your guests can control light switches, put on music or the television, and use the virtual concierge services activated by voice. Read more about voice technology. For those who are hearing impaired, you can implement smart mirrors and other smart technology with these kinds of guests in mind.\n1. Spacious and clutter-free\nSpaciousness is essential to provide adequate space for people in wheelchairs to move around the room freely. This also means that there shouldn\u2019t be any obstacles in their way like carpets or elements wheelchairs could get stuck on. Ideally, for better traction, the rooms should have hardwood floors. The same goes for the visually impaired, there shouldn\u2019t be any obstacles that might get in their way from moving around the room comfortably.\nThe best way to avoid possible hurdles is to have a room that is clutter-free with a simple layout, and minimal furniture to make it as easy as possible to navigate around the room.\n2. Automatic doors\nAutomatic doors are essential, especially for individuals in a wheelchair. There should be an automatic door when entering and exiting the room, and ideally, a power door assist as hotel room doors tend to be very heavy. When possible, automatic doors should also be in the entry to your hotel so that people can easily enter and exit the hotel without help. Learn more about lobby design.\n3. Adjustable beds\nWhether your guests need a hoyer lift or not to get into bed, it\u2019s important to have a bed with an adjustable height that can accommodate any kind of guest. This will also mean that you have the dimensions and height of the bed documented, so your staff is able to answer these important questions. Knowing this height, guests can more easily understand if they will be able to lift themselves into the bed or will need assistance.\nYou may also like:\n4. Roll-in shower and bars\nA roll-in shower means that the shower should be quite spacious without any steps or obstacles in the way, so people in wheelchairs can get in and out of the shower without any problems. The shower should also have a bench and bars in the shower and next to the toilet. The bathroom should have a panic button installed should they need help.\n5. Buzzer and light\nA buzzer and light are necessary for guests who are hearing impaired. The buzzer should be placed outside and a flashing light inside so that they know someone is at the door. The buzzer is also helpful for the visually impaired because they can hear when someone is at the door.\n6. Plugs\nWhile plugs should never be an obstacle for guests with disabilities, it\u2019s important that they are able to easily utilize the plugs, which should ideally be located between 15-48 inches (30-120 cm). The idea is to have the plugs more or less at waist height so that they can be easily reached. There should also be plugs on the desks, on the night stands and in the lamp bases.\n7. Suite set-up\nAs a hotelier it\u2019s important to have different types of rooms be accessible, that means that also suites are set up for people with disabilities, since they often travel with caregivers. These caregivers should be easily able to access the main room, but both parties should have privacy.\n8. Ability to remove items when necessary\nAs a hotelier you want your rooms to be decorated to perfection, However, in the case of accessible rooms, it\u2019s important that this decoration be flexible. That means that furniture can be easily moved or removed in order to accommodate your guests\u2019 needs. Excessive design elements that may get in the way, on the other hand, should be given extra thought if they really contribute or detract from the room\u2019s accessibility features.\nConclusion\nBy implementing these eight tips to make an accessible hotel room, you can be sure that your rooms will create an optimal guest experience by considering the needs of all your hotel guests. Make sure your front desk staff is trained on the different features of your accessible rooms so that they are prepared to answer any questions that come at them. Learn more about building the perfect hotel staff.\nYour staff should also be prepared to provide reasonable accommodations for guests with disabilities, like removing or moving furniture around, or relocating elements within the room to more accessible positions. The key to designing an accessible hotel room is a simple layout, minimal furniture, spaciousness and the ability to provide flexibility."}, {"title": "Tips on Booking an Accessible Hotel Room", "article": "What Does the ADA say about Hotels?\nKnow your Rights\nAllow people with disabilities to make room reservations the same ways that able-bodied people are allowed to, by telephone or online. You should be able to see all the accessible options when you are making an online reservation. The reservations representative should be able to describe the accessible features of the room in enough detail so that people can determine if the room will accommodate their needs. Hotels most hold accessible rooms for reservations for guests with disabilities until all standard rooms in that class are sold. Accessible rooms must be removed from the inventory as soon as it is reserved. Hotels are not allowed to overbook these rooms. Customers with disabilities are guaranteed to receive the specific room type they asked for. This covers amenities like an accessible room with a tub, roll-in shower, number of beds and bed type.\nReasonable Accommodations\nBook Directly\nWhat if the hotel can\u2019t accommodate your request?\nCan a hotel upcharge a person with a disability?\nConclusion\nDo you think that traveling and finding an accessible hotel room is difficult?I have traveled throughout the last 32 years of having a disability and extensively in the last three years and there\u2019s no doubt that finding an accessible hotel room that will accommodate your needs can be challenging.Although I have encountered many obstacles when it comes to finding an accessible room, I don\u2019t let that stop me from seeing the world. It\u2019s a good idea to know your rights before trying to book your accessible room. I have also learned that extensive preparation can help in better outcomes when traveling.The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was written in 1990 and includes requirements for hotels. All types of disabilities are included in the ADA regulations including wheelchair users, the hearing and sight-impaired and many more. Therefore, hotels are required to have many different types of accessible rooms, depending on the size of the hotel. Check out this cool chart from wheelchairtravel.org that shows the size of hotels and the number of different types of rooms they must have.Despite these regulations, I have found many hotels that ignore these regulations. For example, I\u2019ve stayed at hotels before that only offer accessible rooms with roll-in showers, when I prefer an accessible room with a bathtub. Or, sometimes the bigger suites that I want to book for my family are never accessible.Some of these regulations were updated in 2010. Click here to discover some of the new regulations added in.The US Department of Justice filed a case against Hilton Hotels in 2010 that as a result, created five important rules for hotels. You should know your rights when it comes to making hotels reservations.If you would like to read more about the agreement between the U.S. Justice Department and Hilton Worldwide Inc. click here. Not everything that is needed to make a hotel room accessible is specifically outlined in the ADA. However, it does state that hotels are required to fulfill requests for reasonable accommodations, as long as these requests don\u2019t place undue burden or cost on the business.For example, the ADA does not include any regulation regarding the height of the bed. The current trend of hotel is to have beds as high as 30 inches from the floor. Yet, the optimal bed height for a wheelchair user to easily transfer is 17 inches to 19 inches from the floor. So, when beds are almost 30 inches off the ground, making transfers becomes impossible.You can call the front desk and ask someone to come up and remove the box springs, which can help. If you use a transfer hoist you can ask for the bed to be put on risers, allowing the hoist to roll under the bed.There also may be times when multiple pieces of furniture are blocking your access to the bed, curtains, light switches or the thermostat. It is reasonable to ask the hotel staff to remove these unnecessary pieces of furniture from the hotel room. Most hotels will happily help you make your room as accessible and comfortable as possible.From my experience, it is a good idea to call the hotel directly, rather than going through a third party. While using a third-party service might save you a few dollars, your request for a specific accessible room might not be communicated to the hotel. Third-party booking companies also don't always know the availability of the accessible rooms and their notes may never be delivered to the hotel.Additionally, when you use the search engine to look up the phone number for the hotel you desire, make sure you are not accidentally calling a third party booking service. These companies cleverly disguise themselves and it looks like you are calling the actual hotel. I have made this mistake more than once, so let me save you that headache of repeating my mistakes!If the room you reserved is unavailable, the manager will usually offer you a room at a nearby hotel, at no cost to you. This is still a huge hassle to a person with a disability because you will have to find accessible transportation to the other hotel. They should offer to pay for your transportation to the new location.To try and avoid this situation, if you know that you are checking in late, make sure you call the hotel and let them know so they save your accessible room. Make sure you are speaking to a staff member at the hotel and not someone working off-site at the reservations center.Bottom line - charging more for an accessible hotel room is illegal. The ADA states that setting a higher price for a hotel room solely based on its accessibility is disability discrimination. If you are told this by a front desk clerk, I would suggest you ask to speak with a manager. If you can\u2019t get the manager to be reasonable, you can file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Justice.Months ago, I reserved an accessible room with a bathtub and a king-sized bed. When I went to the front desk clerk to check in, she told me that, \"Asking for an accessible room is only a request and it was not available.\" I explained that it was not a request and that I had called ahead to make sure they did not give away my room.She goes on to tell me that there was an accessible suite for a higher price. I kindly explained that I would not pay a higher price for an accessible room because the hotel had given my original room to someone else. I was eventually upgraded to the accessible suite at no additional cost. Most of the time if you explain what the ADA says about accessible hotel rooms, the staff will try to accommodate you.When you have a disability, booking a hotel requires a few extra steps and some roadblocks. But if you know your rights, it can be an opportunity to educate people in the hotel industry about how to accommodate people with disabilities.Traveling, seeing the world and meeting new people are some of the best things in life and part of living your best life possible. Now go out and see this big beautiful world!"}, {"title": "Air Travel Accessibility", "article": "IATA Positions on Passenger Accessibility\n> Fact sheet: Air Transport Accessibility (pdf)\nNeed for harmonization of disability legislation\nWe recognize we can and should do more. One area of concern is the proliferation of differing disability legislation across the globe, which creates confusion for passengers with disabilities, difficulties for airlines, and raises potential safety implications. Critically, there is no common definition of a passenger with disabilities or agreement on the minimum service levels they can expect when traveling by air.\nIATA advocates for a joint government and industry approach, that meets the needs of passengers with disabilities, while ensuring efficient and safe air transport. In particular, working with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), IATA is campaigning with states to closely involve the airline industry in the inclusion of the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities (UN CRPD) into national aviation legislation and policies related to accessible air transport.\nOne person one fare\nOne person one fare (1P1F) refers to the proposal that a disabled traveler or persons who are disabled by reason of their obesity and who is required to use extra seats, either for an accompanying carer or because they cannot fit in a single seat, be only charged the price of a single seat.\nIn the case of an accompanying carer, that person would effectively travel free of charge. At present this is not a legal requirement anywhere except on some domestic routes in Canada, although airlines in some countries have been \u201crecommended\u201d to offer this service.\nThe issue is a complicated one. A unanimous resolution at IATA\u2019s 75th AGM in 2019 committed IATA members to ensure \u2018Passengers with disabilities have access to safe, reliable and dignified travel\u2019, and the industry is working hard with representatives of the disabilities community to improve travel for passengers with disabilities.\nHowever, the industry does not support the 1P1F principle on several grounds:\nThe finances of an air route are often precarious. The average airline profit per passenger in 2023 was $2.25. This can equate to around 3-4 seats in total on a flight. If these seats are given away for free, then the financial viability of an entire flight could be threatened. The circumstances under which a disabled or obese traveler would require two seats are not easily defined and could be open to abuse. A lack of single global definition would create an unworkable minefield of unharmonized requirements which would confuse airlines and passengers alike. Under the UN Convention there are longstanding definitions of proportionality and the reasonable steps that should be taken to ensure people with disabilities have equal access. This is why, for example, not all legacy metro stations in key cities have step-free access \u2013 the cost of retrofitting them all is disproportionately large. The same principle would hold for giving away free seats to disabled or obese passengers on aircraft.\nAirlines remain committed to working with regulators and travelers with disabilities for proportionate and workable solutions to the various challenges of ensuring fair and equal access to air travel.\nIATA position on face-covering for passengers with disabilities\nSome passengers including those with no autonomy to put/remove a face mask, small children and those with certain medical conditions may not be able to use masks for a lengthy period. Some governments have published regulations on face mask exemption.

Check your travel insurance\nFrustratingly, travel insurance costs more simply because you have a disability \u2014 but it\u2019s very important to get the right cover; listing long-term medical conditions and chronic illnesses will save you a fortune if you need medical attention on holiday. Remember that additional insurance to protect mobility aids may also be needed. Shop around for your insurance, a comparison website can show you the best deal depending on how much assistance you need.\n2. Pack enough medication\nAnd check that you can take it into the country you\u2019re visiting. Remembering your medication could be the difference between a good break away and a bad one. Cut down your chances of losing medication when you travel by packing it in separate bags \u2014 one lot in your suitcase, one lot in your hand luggage \u2014 it will mean you\u2019ve always got some to hand no matter what.\nSome countries limit how much of certain types of medication you can carry on one person at one time; strong painkillers are often restricted so get a dispensation letter from your doctor if you need one.\n3. Check with your GP for any extra immunisations\nWe all need jabs when we go to certain destinations but, with particular health conditions, you may need more. It\u2019s definitely worth booking an appointment with your GP or registered nurse to make sure you\u2019re covered.\nHollie-Anne Brooks in Paris\n4. Check you\u2019re fit to fly\nYour GP should also help check that you\u2019re fit to fly. Don\u2019t forget any extras you may need to take with you such as compression socks, spare feeding tubes or masks.\n5. Get a free (or discounted) space for your carer or PA\nTravelling often means having to take a personal assistant with you and if you need multiple carers this can soon add up. Thankfully, you can get discounts \u2014 and often get free spaces. Eurostar, for example, only has wheelchair spaces in standard premier or business class but you will get these at the price of standard tickets; this includes one seat at standard price for your carer too.\n6. Remember all your mobility aids\nMany of us use different mobility aids for different days. If you\u2019re an ambulatory wheelchair user, are you also going to need to take a walking stick with you? Do you need different mobility aids to cover all terrains you might experience on your trip?\nAn airport lift for passengers who use wheelchairs (Getty Images)\n7. Familiarise yourself with the procedure for checking-in mobility aids\nDon\u2019t panic about being without your wheels when flying. Your wheelchair will be stored with the luggage and you\u2019ll be given another to transport you around airports at either end and to and from your seat. If your personal wheelchair or mobility aid comes with specialist storage instructions or needs to be handled in a certain way, make sure the airline knows and you know where, when and how your mobility aid will be returned to you.\n8. Use websites like AccessAble to plan your trip\nAccessAble provides full reviews and information about everything from where the accessible public toilets are in a city to which hotels offer accessible spa access. Plan ahead, including where you are going to eat, and make sure any companies you book through are aware of your access needs and have ramps, working lifts, braille menus and anything else you may require.\nEuan\u2019s Guide provides similar reviews and allows disabled people to leave reviews of different aspects of their visit to certain attractions, so you can get a first-hand account of what you\u2019re about to experience.\n9. Use a specialist travel agents\nSome travel agents, such as Travel Counsellors, specialise in creating incredible accessible travel experiences. If you\u2019re unsure where to even begin, use a specialist agency who can cover everything for you from booking your transfers to and from the hotel to whether the swimming pool has a hoist to which spas have wheelchair accessible treatment rooms.\n10. Consider renting a mobility device\nMany hotels, museums, cruise ships and holiday resorts have mobility scooters and wheelchairs that you can often rent free of charge or for a small fee. Airport assistance will be able to transport you around the airport in a wheelchair or on a buggy and, once you arrive at your destination, check out the range of mobility aids on offer to help get you round the resort.\nMake sure your hotel room has space for your service animal to work, rest and play (Alamy)\n11. Make sure your accommodation has enough room for your service animal\nIf you\u2019re travelling with a service animal, such as a guide dog, make sure the hotel room you\u2019re provided with has enough room for your animal to work, rest and play. Look for hotels with large grounds so you can walk your animal and know your rights \u2014 it is illegal for anyone in the UK to turn away someone with a guide dog, whether that be when entering a taxi or going to a restaurant.\n12. Take an extension lead\nA multi-plug extension lead will become your best friend on holiday; if you\u2019ve got an electric wheelchair to charge and other pieces of equipment that require electricity then the one plug socket that\u2019s not by the bed isn\u2019t going to help. Take an extension lead so you can plug your equipment into multiple holes and have the power connected right next to where you need it.\nSee our pick of the best hotels with accessible rooms\nWhile you\u2019re there\n13. Pace yourself\nIt can be tempting to take part in a tonne of activities, visit all the museums and galleries and spend the night working your way through the cocktail menu but it\u2019s important to remember to pace yourself to keep your health in its best shape for as long as possible.\n14. Embrace train and airport lounges\nOn Eurostar, for example, all disabled people can use the business lounge whether you\u2019re travelling business class or not. I like to use this time to familiarise myself with my itinerary, as well as enjoy the perks such as free snacks, wine and beer.\n15. Use your blue badge\nWe may not be in the EU anymore but your blue badge for parking that you use in the UK is still valid across the EU. Outside of the EU, different rules apply so make sure to check the country\u2019s driving and parking rules ahead of time to avoid a potential fine.\n16. Check foreign public transport\nNot all transport abroad will be as equipped for disabled people as what we\u2019re used to in the UK. Check to see if you need to book assistance or make any other amendments.\nWhere can I travel without a vaccine?"}, {"title": null, "article": null}, {"title": null, "article": null}]
