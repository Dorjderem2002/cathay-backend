[{"title": "Accessible Tourism", "article": "Accessible Tourism\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO, 2023), \u00a8an estimated 1.3 billion people - about 16% of the global population - currently experience significant disability\u00a8. Accessibility for all to tourism facilities, products, and services should be a central part of any responsible and sustainable tourism policy. Accessibility is not only about human rights. It is a business opportunity for destinations and companies to embrace all visitors and enhance their revenues.\nThis portal provides UNWTO resources targeting both public and private sectors to include accessibility into their policies and businesses strategies. All resources have been developed in collaboration with Organizations with Persons with Disabilities (DPOs), and key civil society and tourism sector stakeholders. Most of publications guidelines and recommendations have been laid-out following the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 (level AA).\nNEW!

These recommendations aim to guide the decision-makers of natural resources in tourism in undertaking accessibility improvements. The document has a particular focus on facilitating access to protected areas, beaches and parks. The WCPA Tourism and Protected Areas Specialist Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT), acted as the expert reviewers. Their involvement was key in identifying the best actions geared towards a greater extent of accessibility and inclusiveness within nature areas, vis a vis tourism. The guidance tool, whose drafting was led by UNWTO, the ONCE Foundation and UNE, is part of the promotion of ISO Standard 21902:2021. Download here the guidelines in English and Spanish.\nRecommendations for cultural tourism key players on accessibility UNWTO, Fundaci\u00f3n ONCE and UNE issued in September 2023, a set of guidelines targeting key players of the cultural tourism ecosystem, who wish to make their offerings more accessible.\nThe key partners in the drafting and expert review process were the ICOMOS International Cultural Tourism Committee and the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT). The ICOMOS experts\u2019 input was key in covering crucial action areas where accessibility needs to be put in the spotlight, in order to make cultural experiences more inclusive for all people.\nThis guidance tool is also framed within the promotion of the ISO Standard ISO 21902, in whose development UNWTO had one of the leading roles. Download here the English and Spanish version of the Recommendations.\nNew user-friendly guides for destinations to implement accessibility standards On the occasion of the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, UNWTO, ONCE Foundation and the Spanish Association for Standardization have launched, in December 2022, a user-guide targeting public administrations and tourism destinations to implement ISO Standard 21902:2021. This is a key tool to understand specific actions that can be undertaken by a wide range of organizations entrusted with designing policies, strategies and destination marketing plans in the sphere of accessible tourism.

Just as other guidelines on the UNWTO series, this document will be revised in 2021 with relevant accessibility partners.\nReopening Tourism for Travellers with Disabilities:\nHow to Provide Safety Without Imposing Unnecessary Obstacles In partnership with the ONCE Foundation of Spain and the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT), UNWTO suggested in July 2020 a set of practical steps to ensure accessibility for all, under the new circumstances. \u201cReopening Tourism for Travellers with Disabilities\u201d provides recommendations for destinations and service providers to accommodate customers with disabilities and specific access requirements, including seniors.\nAccessible Tourism Destination The \"Accessible Tourism Destination\" was launched in 2019 by UNWTO and the ONCE Foundation, to recognize and promote accessible tourism destinations. The ATD is an annual UNWTO distinction based on an Expert Committee evaluation, which acknowledges destinations enabling a seamless experience to any tourist, regardless of their abilities. The first ATD was awarded in 2019 and has been temporarily put on hold, given the pandemic.\nVideo \"Change your destination\" The video \u201cChange your destination\u201d was issued by Fundaci\u00f3n ONCE and UNWTO by the occasion of the 2019 International Fair of Tourism (FITUR). Facilitating travel for people with disabilities is an exceptional business opportunity. Yet, a change in mind-set and in the model of tourism services provision is needed in order to meet this major market demand. Accessible environments and services contribute to improve the quality of the tourism product and can create more job opportunities for people with disabilities. Accessibility, therefore, must be an intrinsic part of any responsible and sustainable tourism policy and strategy.\nWorld Tourism Day 2016: \"Tourism for All - promoting universal accessibility\" To mark the celebration of the World Tourism Day 2016 under the theme \"Tourism for All - promoting universal accessibility\" UNWTO, the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT) and the Spanish ONCE Foundation for the Social Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities have produced a compilation of Good Practices in the Accessible Tourism Supply Chain. While these examples provide a small sample of possible solutions regarding accessibility, they will hopefully inspire others to take steps towards broadening the availability of accessible offers in tourism destinations around the world. The publication has been laid-out following the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 (level AA) Download full text: Tourism for All - promoting universal accessibility UNWTO Recommendations on Accessible Information in Tourism The tourism sector stakeholders must deliver accurate, relevant and timely information to its customers, prior to, during and even after the journey. Ensuring that the information is accessible, is without any doubt a key to communicating successfully with visitors in all stages of their journey, particularly with regards to travelers with disabilities and special needs. The UNWTO Recommendations on Accessible Information in Tourism have been developed with the support and collaboration of the ONCE Foundation for Cooperation and Social Inclusion of People with Disabilities and the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT). They were adopted by the Resolution A/RES/669(XXI) of the General Assembly of UNWTO as a follow-up to the \u2018Recommendations on Accessible Tourism for All\u2019 of 2013. The publications in English and Spanish have been laid-out following the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 (level AA). Download full text: UNWTO Recommendations on Accessible Information in Tourism UNWTO Recommendations on Accessible Tourism for All The UNWTO Recommendations on Accessible Tourism for All are meant to be used as a general, basic mainstreaming framework for ensuring that people with disabilities have access to the physical environment, the transportation system, information and communications channels, as well as to a wide range of public facilities and services. The Recommendations incorporate the most relevant aspects of the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities of 2006 and the principles of Universal Design. In the context of a trilateral agreement between UNWTO, ONCE and ENAT, the recommendations were adopted by UNWTO General Assembly Resolution A/RES/637(XX) of August 2013, updating the 2005 UNWTO Recommendations.

The manuals are meant to assist tourism stakeholders in improving the accessibility of tourism destinations, facilities and services worldwide.\nHighlights of the 1st UNWTO Conference on Accessible Tourism in Europe In recognition of accessibility\u2019s importance in the tourism sector, UNWTO and the Government of San Marino jointly organized the 1st UNWTO Conference on Accessible Tourism in Europe (19 - 20 November 2014). Drawing together policy makers, tourism destinations, the private sector and civil society, this landmark event addressed challenges in advancing quality, sustainability and competitiveness within the tourism sector through universal accessibility. This publication features 14 good practices presented at the Conference which focus on accessibility of cultural heritage sites, policy frameworks and strategic actions to make accessible tourism a reality.

Well, yes and no\u2026\nThere\u2019s been a lot of talk about \u201caccessible travel\u201d lately \u2013 especially since the UNWTO designated World Tourism Day to Tourism for All in 2016. But what exactly is it, and why is it so important?\nThe easy answer is that a billion people (that\u2019s 15% of the world\u2019s population), lives with some sort of disability, and ensuring equal access to travel is simply the right thing to do. In fact, the first human rights treaty of the 21st century was the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and Article 30 specifically calls for States Parties to ensure that people with disabilities enjoy the benefits of tourism \u2013 which will be all too familiar to any reader of this article.\nBut accessibility is so much more than \u201cmerely\u201d a human rights issue. In fact, tourism professionals are increasingly realising that it offers an economic opportunity by tapping into a market that is neither niche nor small. It\u2019s a misconception that people with a disability don\u2019t travel. We do. Our travel aspirations are very similar to the general population and, although it\u2019s true that the unemployment rate for people with a disability is higher than that for the general population, many of us have jobs and disposable income. South African Tourism\u2019s powerful commercial, featuring a blind tourist, shows how a disabled traveller is actually no different from any other traveller.\nA number of studies, in particular one by VisitEngland, have shown that the value of the so-called Purple Pound is already large and, importantly, that it\u2019s growing as a proportion of the overall tourism spend. A recent study for Tourism Australia found that the accessible travel market is already larger than the much-vaunted Chinese inbound market and is growing more quickly! What these studies have also underlined is the \u201cmultiplier effect\u201d: people, especially those with a disability, don\u2019t travel alone. For example, I travel with my wife and three children, so if a venue isn\u2019t accessible for me as a wheelchair user, it loses the revenue from not one, but five people.\nFIND OUT MORE ABOUT WHAT INTREPID ARE DOING TO MAKE TRAVEL ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYONE HERE\nBut with an ageing population in developed countries, it\u2019s fast becoming a social and economic imperative to provide accessible infrastructure, when already one in five people in the US and Australia are living with disability. Rightly or wrongly, the market driver of this segment is actually not people who identify as disabled, but the 40% of people who retire with an acquired disability \u2013 a figure that rises to 56% at age 70 and 70% at age 80. Currently, this is the retiring Baby Boomer population \u2013 possibly the first generation in human history that won\u2019t be passing on its wealth to its offspring, but instead feels it has earned the right to enjoy a retirement that is lasting longer and longer and, in most cases, involves travel.\nForward-thinking destination management organisations \u2013 such as VisitEngland, Visit Flanders, the German National Tourist Board and Catalonia \u2013 have already invested significant resources into developing tourism experiences and information portals to enable people with access issues to plan their trips more easily. And their marketing strategies \u2013 and, importantly, choice of imagery \u2013 are specifically targeting an ageing demographic. To ensure their business remains sustainable, tourism service providers are also increasingly looking to offer accessible travel experiences to cater to this demographic.\nRELATED: MEET THE FAMILY TRAVELLING THE WORLD WITH THREE KIDS (AND A WHEELCHAIR)\nIn Australia, and much of the world, we use the term \u201caccessible travel\u201d. But by emphasising access (and with most people equating \u201cdisability\u201d with \u201cwheelchair users\u201d), the stress is immediately put on compliance \u2013 the costly business of installing ramps and accessible toilets \u2013 rather than the opportunity to differentiate and capitalise on a large and growing market. In fact, wheelchair users make up less than 10% of the disabled population. People with vision or hearing impairments outnumber wheelchair users, and people with invisible disabilities \u2013 including those living with long-term illness and severe allergies such as coeliac disease \u2013 represent up to 75% of the disabled population. Even when considering people with a mobility impairment, there are up to four times more people who don\u2019t use a wheelchair than do. Think of your parents or grandparents, who might not use a cane, but still need a hand rail when negotiating stairs and really appreciate the occasional bench for a rest when wandering around parks and gardens. So when we talk about this travel \u201csegment\u201d, it would be so much better if we used the term \u201cinclusive travel\u201d to put the emphasis on making sure experiences are able to be enjoyed by the widest possible number of people, instead of making them accessible to a relatively small number of wheelchair users.\nLooking at it this way means there are countless small changes that businesses of all sizes could make that would benefit a wide range of travellers with access needs: assistance dog toileting areas and water bowls; TVs with a captioning option; clear passageways with good colour contrast and signage; large-print black-and-white information materials (ask anyone over 55 about reading fancy menus in dimly lit restaurants\u2026); easy-to-read fonts such as Arial or Helvetica in signage or information materials; hearing loops; telephones that are compatible with hearing aids; vibrating pillow alarms; lowered counters or an occasional table in front of reception to welcome wheelchair-using guests or people of short stature; blocks to adjust the height of beds or tables; making sure cooking and cleaning practices cater for people with food allergies or chemical intolerances\u2026 the list goes on.\nRELATED: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND TRAVEL WITH A HEARING IMPAIRMENT\nAnd let\u2019s not forget the value of a website that\u2019s accessible for people with disabilities, particularly the vision-impaired (Intrepid Travel are working towards having their website accessible to more people \u2013 by aiming for AA Level of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines \u2013 by the end of 2020). Because here\u2019s the thing: the greater one\u2019s access needs, the greater the need for planning using detailed and accurate information. But, ironically, relevant and reliable information regarding accessibility is hard to come by; it\u2019s often either missing or hidden away under FAQs.\nWhat are Intrepid doing to accommodate travellers with disabilities?\nTara Kennaway, who heads up Accessible Travel in Intrepid\u2019s Product team, had this to say. \u201cWe know that travellers with disabilities are increasingly looking beyond specialised disability tour operators and want to travel in an authentic, exploratory way with their family, friends and other like-minded people. We still have plenty of work to do to make our trips more accessible and to be able to share our style of exploring the world with as many people as possible. It\u2019s been fantastic to see the engagement of our staff around the globe in this topic, from our sales teams responding to enquiries from travellers with disabilities, our local operators auditing our trips in country, and our group leaders delivering amazing experiences and customer service to our travellers.\u201d\nIn order to travel independently, trustworthy information is the key and that\u2019s Lonely Planet\u2019s reason for being: to help travellers to get the best out of their trip by providing the information they need to make informed decisions. We have made a modest start by producing access guides to different destinations. Our Accessible Rio de Janeiro guide was supplied to the International Paralympic Committee for visiting athletes; the IPC have already signed up for an Accessible Tokyo guide for the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics. We have exciting plans for this guide as we look to partner with new technology partner What3Words, an innovative navigational mobile app, to get people with a disability exactly where they need to be.\nSUBSCRIBE TO INTREPID\u2019S NEWSLETTER FOR TRAVEL TIPS, COMPETITIONS, GIVEAWAYS & MORE\nI have also curated the world\u2019s largest collection of online resources for travelling with access needs: Accessible Travel Online Resources, which was recognised by the UNWTO in 2016 as one of a handful of examples of best practice in accessible tourism and is now vastly expanded in the current third edition. Lonely Planet\u2019s Accessible Travel Phrasebook contains some 100 words and phrases to assist disabled travellers to make their needs known in 35 languages.\nLonely Planet also publish online articles by disabled travel bloggers (including yours truly) and regularly share and promote the cause to our huge social media following, leveraging our authority in a positive way, in the hope that this will create a knock-on effect. Judging by a recent survey of followers, in which 43% told us they want it to hear more about accessible travel, it looks as though we\u2019re on the right track.\nIntrepid is committed to making travel widely accessible, regardless of ability or disability. If joining a group trip is not practical we may be able to provide you with a private departure.

In 2016, she founded Planet Abled, a travel company that caters to the needs of people with various disabilities, a group the World Health Organization estimates at 15 percent of the world\u2019s population. Arora isn\u2019t the only one pushing for more thoughtful travel experiences\u2014here\u2019s a look at six companies focused on accessible travel.\nTravel for All\nTravel for All has organized more than 5,000 vacations around the world for travelers with a variety of requirements, including cane users, slow walkers, hearing and vision impaired persons, travelers with complex health issues like dialysis and developmental disabilities, and wheelchair users. \u201cAs multiple sclerosis began to affect my own personal travel, I researched what resources could assist me with executing travel using my wheelchair,\u201d says CEO Tarita Davenock. \u201cI was shocked when I saw the lack of services.\u201d Every trip Travel for All plans comes with an accessibility specialist. \u201cWe research and give our clients the pros and cons of any area in the world before planning the trip, so our client knows what to expect while they are in that destination,\u201d says Davenock. \u201cMeticulous planning and great attention to detail are the keystones of keeping our vacations safe.\u201d\nA Seable group trip in Cambodia, where travelers visited the Wat Phnom temple Courtesy Seable Holidays\nSeable Holidays\nSeable Holidays specializes in trips for visually impaired travelers. All trips include trained chaperones\u2014who undergo a background check\u2014as well as inclusive sports and sensory activities like horse riding, scuba diving, kayaking, wine tasting, yoga, and tactile museum excursions. And everything is thoroughly vetted, with chaperones, activities, and accommodations tested by blind people before they\u2019re recommended by the company. While trips are on pause during the pandemic, Seable Holidays will bring them back in summer 2022.\nEasy Access Travel\nDebra Kerper and her team at Easy Access Travel accommodate most types of physical disabilities in their solo trips and mixed group tours. While Kerper sometimes relies on her own experiences as a traveler in a wheelchair, she says every trip needs to be tailored to an individual client\u2019s needs. To do so, the team spends time getting to know their clients to match them with the best vacation choice, and visits hotels and tourist spots for inspection, takes cruises beforehand, and collects information from trustworthy sources to ensure a safe, accessible, and fun experience.\nPlanet Abled\nNeha Arora\u2019s Planet Abled arranges customized tours for people with different types of disabilities, and also plans group tours that include non-disabled people. Their trips mostly take place in India and South East Asia, with plans to expand to countries in Europe, and popular activities include river rafting, skiing, trekking, and wildlife safaris. Some of their extra touches include assigning a travel buddy for the blind, seeking special permission from museums so clients can touch and feel the articles on display, and arranging for sign language interpreters for the hearing impaired.\nWheel the World\nAlvaro Silberstein, the CEO of Wheel the World, was paralyzed from the chest down after surviving an accident at 18. This didn\u2019t stop him from seeing the world\u2014he\u2019s since visited 30 countries on five continents. \u201cI realized that people with disabilities should be able to explore places as anyone else,\u201d he says. Most of his clients are adults or seniors with mobility disabilities and wheelchair users, and he can arrange solo travel or group trips. Silberstein wants to create more awareness around accessibility, and his company pays special attention to details like the height of beds, width of doors, and accessibility of bathrooms, compiling this information on the Wheel the World website. Their multi-day trips are designed with local tour operators with a focus on accessible travel, and includes access to adaptive bikes, beach wheelchairs, and equipment for hiking, skydiving, kayaking, scuba diving, and surfing\u2014they\u2019ve even planned Macchu Pichu trips for wheelchair users. The company makes sure \u201cprices are competitive and the pricing is the same no matter if the clients have a disability or not,\u201d says Silberstein.\nA quiet moment in Sintra, Portugal Courtesy Tapooz Travel/Aicha Nystrom\nTapooz Travel\nLaurent Roffe and Aicha Nystrom spent years volunteering with an organization that provides outdoors excursions to people with disabilities. \u201cWe have many friends in wheelchairs as part of our close community,\u201d says Roffe. \u201cI\u2019m a sea kayak guide and [Aicha] is a ski guide and this has always been a source of immense joy for us. Launching our accessible travel business was a natural extension of what we are and what we like to do.\u201d Their company, Tapooz Travel, specializes in trips for those with mobility issues, including visual and hearing impairment, rather than cognitive disabilities. When they have a client with a visual or hearing impairment, they make sure there\u2019s at least one guide trained in sign language, or have a guide who can help with things like reading the menu at the restaurant and providing a voice narration during a site visit. Their network also includes adaptive sports instructors, sailboat skippers, tribal elders, massage therapists, and hot air balloon operators, all of whom are trained to work with travelers with disabilities."}, {"title": "The world\u2019s most wheelchair-accessible travel destinations", "article": "At Lonely Planet, we believe that travel should be for all, and that accessible travel information is vital to making that possible.

Consider these spots for your future travel plans.\nHow KAYAK.com can help you find accessible accommodations\nKAYAK.com's search features can help travelers with disabilities find accommodations that meet their needs. To find accessible hotels, first search for hotels in your destination, and then check the \u201cIncreased accessibility\u201d box in the \u201cAmenities\u201d filters on the left-hand side of the page. This filter reveals properties that offer these features: wheelchair accessible, facilities for disabled guests, in-room accessibility, accessible rooms, facilities for disabled guests, and disabled access.\nPlaya del Carmen, Mexico\nOne hour from Canc\u00fan International Airport, Playa Del Carmen is a far cry from its more revelrous neighbor, yet still has accessible hotels and an accessible beach furnished with beach wheelchairs. There\u2019s even adaptive equipment to allow you to go snorkeling to enjoy the coral reef and green turtles. But the main reason for coming here is to visit the nearby and largely wheelchair-accessible Mayan archaeological sites, Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 and Tulum, a rare chance for the mobility-impaired to get up close to ancient ruins.\nSan Diego skyline from the harbor \u00a9 David Toussaint / Getty Images\nSan Diego, California, USA\nWith the Americans with Disabilities Act having just celebrated its 30th anniversary, much of the USA\u2019s infrastructure is accessible, but our pick is San Diego. Laid out along the classic grid system, generally flat and with a fully accessible trolley system, it also boasts a balmy year-round 64-80\u00b0F climate.\nThe historic Gaslamp Quarter is very wheelchair friendly, as is the massive Balboa Park (incorporating the slightly hilly San Diego Zoo), but it\u2019s the miles of beachfront promenade with beach wheelchairs available \u2013 including a motorized one with caterpillar tracks at Mission Beach! \u2013 that are the main attraction.\nBarcelona, Spain\nWith the national tourism authority and Catalonia in particular pushing accessible travel, it\u2019s no surprise that wheelchair users have been flocking to Barcelona. With 80% of the metro stations and 100% of buses wheelchair-accessible, as well as a relatively flat and cobblestone-free old city, getting around is a breeze.\nWhat\u2019s more, wheelchair users not only jump to the front of the queue for attractions such as the breathtaking Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, they often get in for free! You can explore the length of La Rambla and get around the famous Mercat de la Boqueria; even the beach has wheelchair access and people on hand to help.\nWelcome to Las Vegas \u00a9 Michael Phillips / Getty Images\nLas Vegas, Nevada, USA\nLas Vegas is undoubtedly one of the most accessible cities for people with disabilities in the US. Of course, the casinos and the venues hosting world-renowned musicians and shows are all wheelchair accessible, as are the vast majority of sites and attractions, many of which \u2013 like the Fountains of Bellagio and the Fremont Street Experience \u2013 are completely free.\nMore surprising, perhaps, the High Roller \u2013 the tallest observation wheel in the world, which takes 30 minutes to do a full revolution \u2013 is also wheelchair-accessible. And if you\u2019re after an adrenaline rush, wheelchair users can even enjoy the SlotZilla Zip Line and the Zoomline, which reach speeds of up to 35 miles an hour, or a hot-air balloon ride over the city.\nAdd to this a very wide choice in accessible accommodation, easy exploration along the wide sidewalks of the Strip, a fully accessible bus service that serves all parts of the city, and plenty of wheelchair-accessible taxis and you can begin to understand why Las Vegas has become something of a destination for wheelchair users.\nManchester, UK\nAlthough it was the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, much of central Manchester was rebuilt in the late 1990s, making smooth, wide, step-free pavements, as well as stepless entry into shops, restaurants and bars the norm \u2013 ideal for anyone with mobility requirements.\nNorthern England\u2019s cultural hub is well served by accessible public transport, leaving you free to pay homage at Old Trafford, learn about our industrial roots at the Museum of Science and Industry or shop with the goths at Affleck\u2019s. And if you\u2019ve had enough of the city, the Peak District National Park, with well-developed facilities for visitors with disabilities, is less than an hour away.\nA piazza in Taormina, Sicily \u00a9 Matt Munro / Lonely Planet\nSicily, Italy\nItaly might not spring to mind as a very accessible destination due to its narrow, often cobblestone streets. But there are a number of tour operators that cater to travelers with disabilities. Motor-impaired travelers can enjoy scuba diving, 4WD off-road driving, traditional Sicilian fishing and olive oil making \u2013 not to mention the gastronomic delights normally associated with Italy. Indeed, two Guinness world records have been set here: first paraplegic to dive to 59m and first blind woman to dive to 41m!\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania, USA\nAs one of the oldest cities in the US, you might not expect Philadelphia to be very accessible \u2013 but it is! While the Old Town may offer some challenges for wheelchair users, sidewalks are generally well maintained in the more touristed areas, with plenty of curb cuts and tactile markings.\nThis is particularly useful for wheelchair users considering most of the city\u2019s attractions are within a two-mile radius of the City Hall. The subway, opened in 1907, is only partially wheelchair-accessible, as is the overland rail network, but unfortunately the aging trolley system is not. However, the city\u2019s fleet of more than 1000 buses are all low-floor and wheelchair-accessible, as is the PHLASH tourist bus which runs a continuous loop downtown, stopping at many popular attractions, and costs only $5 for an all-day pass.\nNeedless to say, all of the city\u2019s most popular attractions \u2013 including Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell, Love Park and the Philadelphia Museum of Art \u2013 are fully wheelchair-accessible despite their antiquity. And when it comes to finding accommodations, there are plenty of wheelchair-friendly options right in the center of the action.\nSandridge Bridge in Melbourne, Australia \u00a9 Catherine Sutherland / Lonely Planet\nMelbourne, Australia\nWith its highly accessible public transport system and compact city center, Melbourne is one of the most accessible cities in the world. Visit the sporting capital of Australia armed with Lonely Planet\u2019s accessibility guide, Accessible Melbourne, a free e-book that includes the most up-to-date advice for travelers with special needs.

Most of its buses are accessible, but the city is so small, with plenty of ramps and curb cuts, you might rarely need them.\nThe city\u2019s main drawcard, the 16th-century Ljubljana Castle is reached via a funicular (free for people with disabilities and a companion) or train, both wheelchair-accessible. Many of Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik\u2019s famous bridges have recently been made accessible, and were joined in 2010 by the award-winning Butchers\u2019 Bridge, which allows wheelchair users access to boats.\nSingapore has established accessibility requirements into its city code \u00a9 Ninnat Fongsupa / 500px\nSingapore\nSingapore has to be the most accessible city in Asia and one of the most accessible cities in the world. Its universal code on barrier-free accessibility, in place for decades, plus increasing affluence have resulted in an infrastructure with stepless access to most buildings and no shortage of curb cuts.\nAlthough power wheelchair-friendly taxis aren\u2019t common, the accessibility of the mass rail transit (MRT) and buses makes them unnecessary. In Singapore, the question is not \u201cwhat is accessible?\u201d but rather \u201cwhat isn\u2019t?\u201d \u2013 from its street food hawker centers to its marvelous zoo.\nVienna, Austria\nLike many European cities, Vienna is steeped in history, being the center of the former Habsburg Empire and the musical heart of Europe. Unlike many of its counterparts, however, its cobblestones have been removed, as have many of the curbs.\nThe refurbished city is both flat and compact, with most central shops and cafes fully accessible. Getting around is relatively easy with elevators to the metro and plenty of low-floor trams. Most museums and places of interest are fully accessible, including the must-see Schloss Sch\u00f6nbrunn.\nYou might also like:\nTake a spin around the globe with an accessible travel expert\nWhat I have learned from travelling the world with a wheelchair"}, {"title": "10 people on what accessible travel means to them", "article": "Family holidays are always exciting when you\u2019re a kid \u2013 waking up at the crack of dawn to get to the airport on time, getting new books or magazines to read while you\u2019re there, snaffling sweets on the plane. As a family with four kids, my parents were usually tearing their hair out before we\u2019d even got through security. But for us, as chaotic as we were, the stress and worry was largely centred around their eldest child.\nMy sister has Down Syndrome, and while her charm, confidence and charisma would have you happily convinced that she could tackle any obstacle thrown across her path, there are several things that can slow her down. Travelling can be mentally and physically challenging and exhausting for her. She has weak muscle tone, loose ligaments, poor vision and hearing problems, making it hard for her to walk far or stand on her feet for long periods. She is incredibly trusting, impressionable and easily distracted so she needs a full-time carer to support her.\nSo, as you can imagine, trekking through airports, carrying heavy luggage and waiting in queues can prove testing. Plus, access for disabled people in airports during the 90s was minimal, if non-existent. My parents would tag team: my mum soothing and distracting us while my dad rushed around the terminal, being sent from desk to desk trying to find anyone to help us make the process any easier. At the other end of the flight, trying to make sure the hotel, villa, restaurants, transport or anything else was aware of any extra access or support she may need is yet another thing. We\u2019d need assurance that disabled toilets, changing rooms and assistance were available at every stop-off point. And then, there\u2019s the people who stare, give pitying looks without offering help or \u2013 the worst \u2013 huff and puff as my parents asked politely to skip queues, request seating or for any special consideration.\nAll in all, the process isn\u2019t an easy one \u2013 the lack of understanding from many about what is essential for people with different disabilities to travel; the dearth of detailed information available to disabled travellers and the lack of empathy from many is unnerving, leaving travel as a physical and mental marathon for many disabled travellers.\nAccording to a gov.uk survey from 2021, 22 per cent of the total UK population have a disability \u2013 that's 14.6 million people from the UK alone. It\u2019s not very far-reaching to presume that a large proportion of those people would like the opportunity or freedom to travel. If you then assume that most of these people would like to travel with family or friends, the number of people who are impacted by lack of accessibility in airports, airplanes, hotels, restaurants and so on skyrockets.\nAccessible travel are two words that shouldn\u2019t need putting together; experiencing cultures, art and food around the world is not something that should be reserved exclusively for able-bodied humans. Travel should be inclusive by default, to be enjoyed by anyone and everyone who wishes to do so. Below, we ask some of our favourite travellers about what accessible travel means to them and why now is the time to change the way the world views disability and travel."}, {"title": null, "article": null}, {"title": "Accessible Travel", "article": "The African bush and all of its delights are just waiting to linger in the memories of those who are able to experience her. Now, the world's first luxury wheelchair-accessible safari is ensuring that privilege can belong to everyone."}, {"title": "Travellers with disabilities", "article": "Disabilities do not have to make travel impossible. Most high-income nations have implemented strict requirements for accessibility by law in recent decades, and the US legislation on that topic even served as a model for a UN agreement. That being said, some places \u2013 whether through carelessness or lack of resources or historical restrictions \u2013 are rather hard to access for people with some disabilities. Common problems include sidewalks marred with potholes and or blocked by poles protruding at odd angles, which make walking a challenge even for the healthy and greatly inhibit mobility in a wheelchair, insufficient or non-existent public transit infrastructure, unthoughtful currency design, and needlessly noisy restaurants.\nBlind and visually impaired [ edit ]\nCrossing with tactile paving\nGetting in [ edit ]\nIn most parts of the world, airports and train stations are generally manageable places for a blind or visually impaired person with reasonable mobility skills, except for the navigation problems caused by fast-moving crowds. Plan extra time to get from one place to the other, and let the teeming hordes pass you by. For airport security, you'll need to know what you've put on the scanner to be X-rayed, and how to describe it when it comes out the other end. If they have a question about some of your hand luggage, then you won't be allowed to touch it to confirm that it's yours before they've double-checked it. So if a security officer vaguely asks someone in your direction, \"Is this yours?\", be ready to say that you brought a black wool jacket, a MacBook Air laptop, a black leather briefcase, and an iPhone in a silicone rubber case.\nThe quality of bus service varies much more, and your next stop after the plane or train may be the local bus or a hotel shuttle bus. Some cities have speaking buses, accessible apps that you can download to plan your route, and braille labels on the stop buttons. In other places, you have to rely on the driver to tell you what bus you're getting on, which direction it's going, and when it's your stop.\nIf you have some vision, then mark your luggage in a way that will let you identify it. There won't be too many people with their suitcases covered from edge to edge in a large X or other shape made with neon pink duct tape. If you need something that doesn't rely on vision, then consider a specialized electronic speaking device or a tactile pattern, perhaps made of knots in thin rope very securely wrapped around the handle.\nOnce you're there [ edit ]\nThere are a few hotels that specialize in blind and visually impaired guests. These hotels provide high-contrast features, talking elevator controls, room keys that make it easy to tell which end goes in first, and otherwise understand what makes your life simpler. However, the odds are that you'll be arriving at a typical hotel. In that case, tell the hotel about any requests you have when you make your reservation. Whenever possible, speak to the local hotel staff about their facility before reserving your room, rather than relying on a central call center. When you arrive, the check-in process will likely be the same as any other transaction, right down to the detail of needing to explain to the clerk how to position your signature card or asking him to use the top edge of your credit card to indicate the bottom edge of the signature line. Ask someone to walk you to your room, at least the first time, so that you can orient yourself, check for nearly invisible glass doors and other obstacles along your route, and also figure out the room key. Some hotels deliver a newspaper to each room in the morning. This tripping hazard can usually be stopped or held at the front desk for you upon request.\nIf you use any specialized computer tools, such as a screen reader or software for zooming, then bring your own laptop, braille notetaker, or other electronic devices. You almost certainly won't find what you want in an internet caf\u00e9. Ask hotel staff to point out where the electrical outlets and sockets for internet cables are located in the room.\nIf you're traveling for work, you may not have time to do much else. But if you are on holiday or otherwise expect to have some time, then consider your options. Ask the hotel staff for help finding your preferred form of transportation, as well as for general advice. If you're interested in your destination, try signing up for a guided tour, so that you can hear the tour guide describe the history and culture. Large history and art museums sometimes hold special hands-on tours for blind and visually impaired people. A gift shop that sells scale models of famous local buildings and monuments may let you touch them, so you can better understand the places you've just visited.\nYou may also be able to get useful advice about your destination from the local blindness institute at your destination.\nGuide dogs [ edit ]\nIn general, travel should be planned for well in advance when traveling internationally with a guide dog. As dogs can carry diseases, special testing, vaccination and paperwork is required in many countries, especially island countries. Countries with such requirements include the UK and Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Sweden, Norway, and Finland. The US state of Hawaii has very similar requirements, which are more strict than those in use on the US mainland.\nMany countries allow guide dogs where dogs are not normally allowed (e.g., inside a restaurant, on public transit), while most developing countries don't have laws permitting guide dogs in public places, and locals may not distinguish the difference between pet dogs and guide dogs, causing troubles when entering places where pet dogs are forbidden.\nDeaf and hard of hearing [ edit ]\nSome fire alarms use flashing lights as well as sounds.\nTravellers who are deaf or hard of hearing (HOH) may benefit from some specific features, such as lights on fire alarms. If you can't hear fire alarms, then always tell the hotel staff about your hearing situation when you check in.\nAlmost all restaurants, especially in areas with significant international travel, can take orders from diners who merely point at what they want on the menu. An increasing number of casual restaurants allow ordering online for takeout or delivery, which reduces the risk of miscommunication.\nA few restaurants and stores have employees that use sign language. If you're traveling near a large school for deaf and HOH students, you are likely to find more establishments that are accustomed to patrons who can't hear well. For example, if you're near Washington, D.C., then it may be worth a trip across town to its Near Northeast district, to be near the businesses that cater to students and staff from the famous Gallaudet University.\nNoise is a problem in many restaurants, and it can affect everyone. Most restaurants will do their best to accommodate people who want to be able to hold a conversation, so it's worth asking if a quiet table is available. The makers of the SoundPrint app, which aims to crowd-source noise ratings for American restaurants, say that American Chinese and Indian restaurants tend to be less noisy than other types of restaurants in the US.\nMobility impaired [ edit ]\nWheelchair ramp to a shopping mall in Johor, Malaysia.\nInfrastructure for the mobility impaired varies widely. When considering destinations, looking at cities that have hosted the Olympics (and Paralympics) is a good starting point. Wheelchair ramps and accessibility are part of the preparation. Developed countries tend to have better infrastructure to support travellers with reduced mobility than developing countries. However, some public transit systems like the Paris Metro have poor accessible design, despite serving the capital of one of the wealthiest countries on Earth. Newly constructed infrastructure tends to keep accessibility in mind during the design phase while older infrastructure often do not.\nIn many developed countries some categories of establishments, including most public services, are required to be accessible by wheelchair. Even so, it may be good to call in advance, as the door to use may be a locked back door, or it may be temporarily blocked by roadworks.\nParking placards from your home country may be recognized in other countries.\nThe permits used for getting to use dedicated parking are partly standardised; a tag from a member country of the International Transport Forum should be valid in nearly all of Europe and North America and in a dozen countries elsewhere under the reciprocal recognition of parking badges resolution.\nDepending on your travel goals, your everyday access methods may not be the right choice. Even if you can usually get by without a wheelchair, jetlag and other fatiguing effects of travel, as well as a desire to keep up with the rest of your group, might make a wheelchair desirable some times. Most airports offer wheelchair service to disabled passengers, and many large attractions, such as amusement parks, keep a small number of wheelchairs and baby strollers on hand for use by patrons on the premises.\nEquipment for wheelchair users to enter and exit the water (Syros, Greece)\nAdditionally, a wheelchair that works well in your home area might not carry you over the terrain at your destination. Some people will find it cost-effective to buy a specialized chair, but many others will benefit from renting them. Powered trackchairs that can handle forest floors usually cost more than US$10,000, but they can be rented in some places for as little as $100. The rickshaw-styled single-wheel Jo\u00eblette wheelchairs are popular with hiking families all over Europe, and they can be rented in some public parks for a nominal fee. Wheelchairs with wide balloon tires to navigate sandy beaches often cost more than $1,000, but some beaches rent them at a low cost. These are generally manual chairs that require someone else to push the chair. Because this specialized equipment is key to seeing your destination, and because most parks only keep one chair on hand, contact your destination in advance to confirm that any advertised equipment is still available and in good working order, to make sure that it is suitable for your needs, and to ask whether it can be reserved in advance.\nSpecialized wheelchairs for travelers\nSingle-wheel rickshaw-style wheelchair for hiking, usually pulled by one person and pushed by another\nAll-terrain, powered, tracked wheelchair used for hunting\nBeach wheelchair with wide tires\nAutism [ edit ]\nA sunflower lanyard can be worn to signal hidden or invisible disabilities to trained transit staff.\nTravellers with autism (including Asperger\u2019s Syndrome) often feel overwhelmed by noise and general \"hustle and bustle\". Airports and trains often have a lot of noise. A pair of noise-cancelling headphones can muffle the sound, while a fidget spinner can be a distraction. Some airports have sensory areas or quiet rooms to provide a calming environment. Inquire ahead of time if a hotel offers autism-friendly rooms, which reduces the anxiety of travellers who are extra sensitive to the changes of the new surroundings while travelling.\nTravellers with autism are often vulnerable to scams, as they can find it more difficult to tell when someone is lying to them. Having a solid understanding of typical local crimes and scams, and practising how to respond to strangers, may help counter scams. The basic point is that you in this context should ignore most strangers who claim to need help and those who offer help you did not look for. If somebody needs help, some locals are better equipped to provide it.\nFatigue [ edit ]\nRegardless of whether your fatigue is caused by a sleep disorder, an autoimmune disease, heart disease, or something else, there are several strategies that can help you have a successful trip. The first is: whatever things really work for you at home, whether that's following a particular diet, only doing one \"big\" thing every other day, taking a nap each afternoon, or something else, don't leave those strategies at home.\nPlan ahead. This includes all of the usual travellers' plans, like where to eat and what sights to see, but also find out things like whether you need to make reservations in advance and whether they can be cancelled without penalty if you run out of energy. Consider travel insurance if you think the whole trip might need to be cancelled. If airplanes wear you out, plan for a day to recover when you get there. If you can recharge on a train or in a car, then you might be ready to go as soon as you arrive. When you are thinking about travel, think about all of it: the hour-long drive to the airport, the two hours in the airport, the four hours on the plane, the half-hour waiting for your checked luggage, and so forth. Have a plan for dealing with jetlag if you're changing time zones. Keep your plans flexible and not too crowded. It's better to plan to see one museum, and have some backup options in case you're having a particularly good day, than to plan to do three things, and feel disappointed that only two happened. Remember that the most memorable moments aren't usually the headline attractions, but instead are the unexpected, unplannable moments of joy. Visiting the Louvre may be a life goal, but you may remember other moments \u2013 a new favorite flavor of ice cream, the silence after a snow storm, that still-warm baguette, the ladybug on a child's finger \u2013 with more clarity later. Remember that you are not doing travel \"wrong\" if your plans involve relaxing in a comfortable spot instead of rushing back and forth between popular tourist activities. Be realistic about your energy and abilities, and factor that in to your plans. If your trip has one main goal in mind, such as an amusement park or a large museum, you might be able to save money by buying discounted end-of-day tickets or by getting a multi-day or annual pass. These may permit you to visit the destination for a couple of hours each day for the same cost as a few long and exhausting days.\nConsider the demands of your destination. If you don't fare well in the heat, then either pick a cooler time to visit or plan for ways to stay cool. Make sure that hotels, restaurants, and vehicles have air conditioning. If you need to be out in the heat, look into cooling vests and other specialized equipment. Layers of clothing, such as two thin T-shirts instead of one heavy one, can let you adjust to changing temperatures.\nPack everything you need, and nothing else. Make a list and check it twice, especially if your fatigue makes it difficult to remember a thousand little details. Depending on your destination and your needs, you might find it more convenient to ship some things to your destination in advance, or to rent it locally so that you have less luggage to bring with you. Keep medication, water, safe snacks, and any necessary equipment, such as a walking stick or a pillow, with you.\nTake advantage of services that are intended to help you. For example, call the airline or cruise line and arrange a wheelchair ride. If you can afford it, hire people to help you, such as a local tour guide or a driver. Can someone else wash the laundry or help with getting ready to leave or returning home?\nIf you're traveling with other people or if you are visiting friends and family at your destination, have a conversation well in advance, so that everyone has the same expectations about your energy budget. Tell them what's important to you and what you'd like them to do when you need to rest.\nRespect [ edit ]\nParking space for mobility impaired in Malaysia\nKeep the following in mind when travelling with or meeting a fellow traveller who happens to be disabled.\nIf you need to interact with a person with disabilities, then speak directly to that person, in the same manner that you would speak to any other stranger whom you would like to make a favorable impression on. For example, do not ask a blind man's children what he would like to do; ask him directly.\nDo not touch people with disabilities, or any of their equipment or other belongings, without getting their permission first. \"May I help you with that?\" is more polite than grabbing their things. Be prepared to have your offer of help declined.\nPeople all have varied interests, and once practicalities have been taken care of, a person's disability is seldom the most important thing in their life. Someone in a wheelchair may prefer to spend the day at a bird sanctuary rather than attend a wheelchair race, and a blind person might prefer discussing the local culture and history of a town rather than the absence of braille on the museum exhibits. Don't ask how or when they became disabled. This can be perceived in a rude way and they\u2019re probably bored with telling that story already. Do ask the same things that you would ask any non-disabled person, which includes small talk about your adventures with fellow travellers and requests for advice about local sights and restaurants from people who are familiar with your destination. Don't make jokes or say clever things. They have already heard all of them, from \"Don't run over me in that wheelchair\" to \"I sure wish I could board the plane first\", hundreds of times. These types of jokes are also considered very poor etiquette.\nThere is no need to talk loudly or slowly to blind people. They can hear you well enough.\nDo not pet, feed or otherwise distract a guide dog without first asking the owner's permission.\nThough ignorance, laziness and arrogance probably could be classified as disabilities, they are self-inflicted and do not qualify one to occupy a disabled parking space. These parking spaces are reserved to make it easier for someone in a wheelchair, or who uses crutches or a cane, to enter and exit a vehicle. At the same time, if you see someone walking from a disabled space alone with no apparent difficulty, don't jump to the conclusion that the person is not qualified to occupy the space. Disabled parking permits are often available to many people who don't use wheelchairs, but have other conditions that seriously limit their mobility (such as a leg amputation, certain cardiac or respiratory conditions, or chronic severe pain). The driver may also be going inside to pick up the person who is entitled to use the space, and assist that person in entering the vehicle.\nMost people rarely give a second thought to toilets because they are always there and easy to use, but for a person with mobility limitations, using a standard toilet can be very difficult or even impossible. Check on toilet facilities before planning an outing.\nCountries information [ edit ]\nWheelmap has information about wheelchair-accessible places in many countries. The information is rather basic with 3 levels: All rooms accessible, some rooms accessible, not accessible.\nLonely Planet created a free resource for finding accessibility information by country called Accessible Travel Online Resources (free PDF download through store).\nCanada [ edit ]\nIn Canada, legislation that regulates federal accessibility standards was passed in 2019, with varying grace periods. The regulation includes interprovincial bus routes, train service and airlines. For Ontario, the building codes, and rules for transportation and service providers to improve accessibility, will be fully enforced by 2025.\nThe European Union tries to set common accessibility standards, especially in new construction and public transit. Most bus operators and many train operators should be able to accommodate people in wheelchairs, though more rural stations may lack elevators and legacy platforms may not have the right height for current rolling stock.\nThe Euro banknotes and coins are intentionally designed to be easily recognizable by touch. While the ten cent coin is slightly smaller than the five cent coin, it is easily distinguished by its ridge. Similarly the fifty cent coin, while bigger than the one Euro coin, has a different ridge as well. Also, banknotes increase in size as the denomination increases.\nFinland [ edit ]\nGeneral awareness of accessibility issues is quite high, although in practice there are still many problems. Most public facilities and many private ones have arrangements for people with wheelchair or hearing aids. Anyhow it is a good idea to call in advance to check any special arrangements (such as entry by a locked back door) and have company that can help with unexpected problems.\nToilets designed for use with a wheelchair are common where there is more than one toilet. Public buildings and modern shopping centres should be fairly safe bets. Bus and railway stations also used to be, but since the 2000s they have all too often been closed or repurposed, even in big towns.\nService dogs are accepted also in shops where dogs in general are not allowed. Many traffic lights have audible signals. On buses there is usually a reserved seat behind the driver, but in practice that seat may not have space for the dog but in the aisle. Ask the driver (any fellow passenger can help with translation, if needed). Service dogs generally travel for free, also on the railways, where you should include them on your ticket (you might want to buy the ticket by phone or at a desk rather on the net, to have the personnel handle the booking interface).\nWhere finding a parking lot may be hard, there are often parking space reserved for people with disabilities. There is a special permit to use these parking lots. Foreign permits are recognized, given they have the international symbol.\nThe railways have wheelchair-accessible cars on most routes; sleeper cars each have one cabin for a person with disabilities and his or her assistant. Assistance can be ordered in advance, from the platform to your seat; conductors will help you on the train itself. If you have a personal assistant (any adult) travelling with you, he or she gets a free ticket, provided you are in wheelchair or have an accepted certificate. Call \u260f (domestic calls free) for details.\nLocal buses are usually equipped for wheelchair access (and using the buses is free at least in some cities, also for a person assisting). Coaches, on the other hand, usually cannot handle wheelchairs, other than by putting collapsible ones in the luggage compartment; you will need your own assistant to get to a seat.\nTaxis usually charge extra if you have a wheelchair or need significant assistance. On the other hand, the elderly and people with disabilities belong to their most important customer groups, so most drivers will be very helpful and professional.\nMets\u00e4hallitus (\"Forest Administration\"), which manages the national parks, gives information on accessibility for each destination, many of which have trails accessible by assisted or motorized wheelchair. Often, the trails are too steep to cope on your own in a normal wheelchair. The other trails are often too rough for people with even minor mobility impairment. The exhibitions and services at visitor centres are usually accessible.\nThere are specific regional SMS emergency numbers for those that cannot communicate by voice. These are not posted on the Internet. Enquiries to \u260f .\nJapan [ edit ]\nACCESSIBLE JAPAN offers information for tourists with disabilities and other mobility issues with sections including general information, a database of accessible hotels, tourist attraction reviews, equipment rentals and more. They have also published a tour guide book for Tokyo, Accessible Japan's Tokyo: All you need to know about traveling to Tokyo with a disability.\nHEART BARRIER gathers a database of wheelchair-accessible restaurants and shops all around Japan. They include details like slope width and slope, which are not included in Wheelmap.\nPeru [ edit ]\nWheelchair tours of Machu Picchu are available, as are accessible tours of the Inca Highlands. Apumayo Expediciones is the most established accessible tour operator in the area.\nSouth Africa [ edit ]\nSee also Disabled travel in South Africa\nUnited Kingdom [ edit ]\nThe gap between some platforms and the train doors is uncomfortably large even for people with no disabilities.\nAccessibility in the UK is generally good, although there are challenges. For example, train station platforms frequently do not align with the train doorway, sometimes by more than a foot (0.3 m). Assistance is available at most train stations, but you'll want to arrive in plenty of time to make arrangements.\nDeliberate discrimination against individuals with disabilities is prohibited in law, with many popular destinations and venues having gone considerably beyond the 'reasonable' adjustments required. For example, Bournemouth offers not only beach access through concrete ramps down to the beach, but also beach wheelchairs to rent, charging stations for electric scooters, and beachside elevators during the day. In the Yorkshire Dales, barriers have been removed on certain, mostly short, routes in the Miles without Stiles program, to create routes that have appropriate gradients and surfaces for people with mobility impairments.\nUnited States [ edit ]\nWhile the U.S. for the most part is very good at accommodating disabled travelers, one glaring exception is money for blind travelers. While coins can be distinguished relatively easily by touch, the physical sizes of the coins do not consistently relate to the value of the coin. Most notably, the dime (10 cents) is physically the smallest coin. The situation for paper currency (notes) is even worse for the blind. All denominations are the same physical size (unlike the euro, in which the notes increase in physical size as the denomination increases), and there are no tactile features that enable blind people to readily distinguish different denominations by feel. A redesign of each U.S. note that would include a tactile feature to better accommodate people who identify currency by touch has been delayed until 2028 at the earliest and probably several years later for the $20 bill, which is one of the most commonly used. In the meantime, the American Foundation for the Blind has published a guide detailing alternative ways to identify currency."}, {"title": "Accessible travel", "article": "GETTING AROUND\nAccessible taxi and coach services:\nDiamond Cab: Accommodates a maximum of two wheelchair users on a single trip with two carers, or one wheelchair user with up to four passengers.\nSynCab:\n- e-Multi-Purpose Taxi (e-MPT): Accommodates a maximum of one wheelchair user on a single trip with three carers, or five passengers without wheelchairs.\n- Multi-Purpose Taxi (MPT): Accommodates a maximum of one wheelchair user on a single trip with two carers, or four passengers without wheelchairs.\n- e-Multi-Purpose Taxi (e-MPT): Accommodates a maximum of one wheelchair user on a single trip with three carers, or five passengers without wheelchairs. - Multi-Purpose Taxi (MPT): Accommodates a maximum of one wheelchair user on a single trip with two carers, or four passengers without wheelchairs.

The following are some useful tips that can help you plan a safe and enjoyable journey in China.\nResearch in Advance\nChoose a suitable destination, taking into account its natural environment, disabled access, and level of health care available. Generally, the disabled access environment in China is developing very fast, especially in big eastern cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Hong Kong.\u00c2\nMost 5-star hotels in metropolises can provide wheelchairs if pre-booked. Deposits are usually required. Get more information through the internet or guide books, or from us, about your destinations.\nOne of our customers has written an assessment on China's disabled facilities from 16 years' experience as a carer.\nConsult your doctor. Discuss your planned trip and activities involved. Consult about the medication you will need to take, and any immunizations that might be needed. Do a thorough medical check-up to make sure that you are fit to travel.\nConsult the Chinese embassy or consulate in your country, and check rules and regulations about things you might need to take to China, such as a wheelchair, medication, and therapy equipment. China Art International Travel Services Ltd. provides wheelchair rentals in Beijing for 150 yuan/day/wheelchair.\nWhen inquiring about a tour, inform your travel advisor of your disability, health conditions, and any special arrangements required, so that they can make suitable suggestions and arrangements for you.\nConsult the airline that you are going to take, and check their luggage rules, including how to carry your medication, wheel chair, therapy equipment, etc.\nConsider the climate. If possible, choose a month or destinations when the weather will be most conducive to wheelchair access and comfort.

According to the UNWTO, the gains were led in part by a 9 percent increase in international arrivals in Africa.\nAt a time when so many booming industries are technologies, tourism has become a powerful people-driven economic force, and with that power comes a massive responsibility. In many parts of the world, inequality is widening and wealth increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few. Tourism\u2019s potential for inclusivity presents an opportunity to distribute the economics of a booming global industry more broadly, to communities and people who not only have not benefited from tourism before but may face limited options for building better livelihoods for themselves and their families.\nOur upcoming Africa Travel Summit reminds us of how critically important it is that we get the tourism opportunity right. If done well, the benefits will stay within the communities in which the travel occurs\u2014distinguishing travel from many other industries that have found riches in Africa and exported them elsewhere. For us at Airbnb, the two-day summit will be a chance to hear and learn from some of the continent\u2019s most visionary entrepreneurs in travel and technology. The Summit is part of our $1 million commitment, announced in 2017, to expand tourism in Africa in ways that are local, authentic, sustainable, geographically diverse and yes, demographically inclusive\u2014what we call \u201chealthy tourism.\u201d\nTo help our broader community beyond Africa engage with the Travel Summit, Airbnb will showcase the work of African content creators, highlight African destinations and celebrate African hosts on our global social media channels for the week.\nAlso this month, you can join us in following Jessica Nabongo, who is now nearly 70 percent of the way toward becoming the first black woman to visit all 195 countries and states in the world. A dual citizen of both Uganda and the US, Jessica is using her Ugandan passport as well as her American one in order to raise awareness of outbound African tourism and the mobility gap between US and African passports. We\u2019ll be engaging with Jessica as she travels to Lebanon, Cyprus, Jordan and Beijing.\nBut opportunities to make sure underserved communities can benefit from inclusive travel aren\u2019t exclusive to developing countries\u2014they can be found in the world\u2019s most advanced economies.\nAirbnb\u2019s Srin Madipalli, Suzanne Edwards, and the rest of the team formerly of travel startup Accomable are working with our staff and local governments in the UK and Japan to find ways to expand both hosting and travel opportunities for people with disabilities.\nFor the start of Hispanic Heritage Month on September 15, Airbnb\u2019s own Juntos employee resource group will host a fiesta to celebrate our local employee, vendor, host and guest community and raise awareness of Latinx issues. We\u2019re also sponsoring 25 students as they attend the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute\u2019s Leadership Conference in Washington, DC, a gathering designed to empower young Latinx to take on issues affecting the US Latinx community.\nThis month also brings the second anniversary of Airbnb\u2019s anti-discrimination report, issued on September 8, 2016 as our first step\u2014of what we know will be many\u2014toward eliminating bias wherever possible from our platform. At Airbnb, we are committed to fighting bias through inclusion. Our ability to provide guests with an inclusive travel experience can only start with Airbnb being an inclusive travel company, looking internally and externally for opportunities to champion diversity and rid the platform of potential discrimination. We also believe that inclusiveness is self-perpetuating. As our CEO and Head of Community Brian Chesky often observes, when we travel and experience new surroundings and cultures, we realize people are 99-percent the same.\nAmong the many other initiatives we launched in releasing the report was Instant Book, an opt-in feature for hosts that reduces the potential for bias by allowing any guest to book a listing without securing prior host approval. While we have much more work to do here, I am pleased to report that two years after we launched the feature, Airbnb now offers 3 million listings, 60 percent of our inventory, that are instantly bookable.\nWe also recently took a step toward fulfilling our commitment to diversifying our senior leadership by appointing our first woman board member, Ann Mather, an incredible leader from Pixar and Disney and current board member of both Pixar and Alphabet. Ann joins former American Express Chairman Ken Chenault as our second independent board member. Their expertise and life experience will be vital as Airbnb works toward fulfilling our vision of becoming the world\u2019s first end-to-end\u2014or first truly all-inclusive\u2014travel company."}, {"title": "How global tourism can become more sustainable, inclusive and resilient", "article": "Create a free account and access your personalized content collection with our latest publications and analyses.\nLicense and Republishing\nWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.\nThe views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum."}, {"title": "Inclusive travel is impacting the choices travellers make: Expedia", "article": "New data released by Expedia Group Media Solutions shows that consumers are paying attention to how inclusive current travel offerings are when searching and booking.

As more and more people with disabilities are keen to travel \u201caccessible tourism\u201d has emerged as a potential market segment for the tourism industry in a few developed countries including America, UK and Australia and those governments are giving special attention to create barrier-free tourism destinations. The Chinese government is also working hard to elevate the situation of people with disabilities. As a result of the implementation of several laws regarding people with disabilities, their social and economic status has improved. In spite of the Chinese government\u2019s effort to develop China as a barrier-free destination, the market of traveller with disabilities has been given little attention by China\u2019s tourism industry. Therefore this study attempts to investigate the current situation of tourist facilities and service for visitors with disabilities in Guangzhou as a starting point to improve barrier-free tourism in China. Several problems concerning accessibility to serve disabled visitors and a few recommendations to minimize the accessibility barriers were discussed.

New designs take into account the needs of everyone, including the elderly and the disabled. But we also live in a compact and vertical city. The pavements can be narrow and the hills steep. So, there is much work still to be done to enhance accessibility.\nWhen planning new development areas and major public works, we are committed to make them sustainable and accessible to all. For example, accessibility and sustainability are two of the planning principles of the 40-hectare West Kowloon Cultural District, one of the world's largest arts and culture undertakings so far.\nWe also adopt a people-oriented approach when facelifting our world-famous harbourfront, planning new towns, and rejuvenating older districts. More green and open space and barrier-free facilities will be provided. Come back in a few years, I am sure you will see many new and vibrant areas in Hong Kong .\nSustainable development must be inclusive. Everyone should have the opportunity to contribute to sustainable development and benefit from it.\nA truly caring and inclusive society is a measure of sustainable development. One of the yardsticks measuring the level of social inclusion is the connectivity of people and their capacity to get around.\nNo man is an island. Access and transport are priority issues for all, regardless of age and physical ability. It is how people achieve and maintain independence and participate in activities and no one should be left out.\nCross-sectoral collaboration\nThe Government's policy objectives in this respect are enshrined in our 2007 Hong Kong Rehabilitation Programme Plan. The two strategic directions for the development of the rehabilitation service, including accessibility, are, firstly, to promote cross-sectoral collaboration in providing a barrier-free environment.\nThis includes diversified services for people with disabilities so they can fully integrate into the community; and second, to empower people with disabilities to become valuable members of society.\nIn terms of access and transport, our goal is to create an enabling physical environment for persons with disabilities. This involves providing easy access to all buildings and use of public transport.\nThe United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities came into effect in Hong Kong in August 2008. The purpose of the convention is to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all people with disabilities, and to promote respect for their inherent dignity.\nHong Kong is now preparing a report setting out in detail the measures to implement the convention and the resulting progress achieved, including accessible transport and tourism. Our report will form part of our nation's overall report.\nAccessible transport\nOne of our objectives is to provide accessible public transport services and infrastructure through the vision of \"Transport for All\". Under this umbrella, a \"5-Betters Strategy\" was formulated. The strategy forms the backbone of our holistic programmes and covers five main elements.\nFirst, better accessible transport services for all. This covers the further expansion of an accessible public transport network and optimising the efficiency of Reha-bus services.\nSecond, better public transport infrastructure and facilities for all. Areas covered include the provision of accessible public transport interchanges, bus terminals, taxi stands, ferry piers and railway stations.\nThird, better streets and pedestrian areas for all. We are providing better pedestrian facilities such as electronic audible devices at pedestrian crossings and tactile guide paths to connect major public transport interchanges and community facilities. We are installing more lifts at footbridges and extending pedestrian areas.\nFourth, better planning standards, guidelines and procedures. This involves updating our Transport Planning & Design Manual and guidelines to meet changing needs and new circumstances.\nBetter partnership\nAnd finally, better partnership for action and results. Here we are developing advisory channels on new initiatives to promote the vision of \"Transport for All\". We are also partnering with local and overseas stakeholders to promote accessibility to transport for people with disabilities.\nEffective partnership is vital in realising our \"Transport for All\" vision. This collaboration involves the Government working hand-in-hand with transport operators, the rehabilitation sector and organisations for people with disabilities.\nThrough the \"5-Betters Strategy\", public transport services and transport facilities have become more user-friendly and accessible to people with disabilities. Railway and franchised bus operators are encouraged to make their vehicles and services accessible as far as practicable.\nApart from special transport services funded by the Government to serve those who are unable to use public transport, we also provide incentives in the form of a profitable operating environment and in setting guidelines and design standards to encourage provision of such facilities.\nPositive approach\nThis positive approach has helped to motivate, energise and enhance our drive towards a more accessible transport system.\nMany of you have travelled long distances to be here. I hope your experience of our airport, transport and hotels as well as here at the Convention and Exhibition Centre has enriched your stay so far. Last year, we received almost 30 million visitors from around the world.\nTourism is a key sector of our economy. We want you to enjoy your stay with us and, when you return home, spread the word that Hong Kong is a diverse, vibrant and accessible holiday destination.\nOver many years, our tourism industry has become highly developed. We are increasingly focused on segmentation as a way to provide better service to specific tourist groups such as families, business people and cultural tours.\nOne rapidly emerging market is \"grey tourism\" for seniors. To encourage more seniors to visit our city, we are embracing the principle of barrier-free tourism.\nBarrier-free tourism\nBarrier-free tourism has been adopted in our major tourist attractions including the Peak, Ocean Park , Hong Kong Disneyland and Hong Kong Wetland Park . We also aim to provide barrier-free tourism to new tourist attractions in future, such as the new cruise terminal.\nWe have put in place measures to facilitate visits by disabled people and the elderly, such as providing wheelchair access, inductive loop systems and tactile guide paths. Staff are trained to provide assistance to visitors with specific needs so that everyone can enjoy the facilities and attractions.\nBarrier-free access is an important feature at all major tourism areas such as shopping malls, restaurants and hotels.\nAs well as modern infrastructure, specific schemes are rolled out by tourism operators to welcome disabled and senior guests. For instance, local seniors can enjoy free entry to Ocean Park . Hong Kong Disneyland has also introduced a new scheme to offer free tickets for disabled persons and their carers.\nOur mass transit railway is now charging nominal price for the elderly two days of the week to facilitate the elderly to travel, meet friends and families and enjoy all sorts of activities all over the territory.\nIn addition, the Hong Kong Tourism Board and the Hong Kong Rehabilitation Society have worked together in creating online platforms. These contain useful tourism information for disabled persons. We believe that barrier-free travel offers a new opportunity for our tourism industry.\nChief Secretary Henry Tang gave these remarks at the opening ceremony of the 12th International Conference on Mobility & Transport for Elderly & Disabled Persons at the Hong Kong Convention & Exhibition Centre."}, {"title": "A Guide on Barrier-free Travel", "article": "In January 2020, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) and Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU) jointly organized the Barrier-Free Discover Tour in Taipei.

Although it can be challenging to find many viable options depending on the destination, many places are becoming increasingly more accessible.\nExploring Your Options\nThere are several options available in most places that can help make transportation more convenient and accessible. Depending on the flexibility you want while traveling, or the destination you\u2019re planning a trip to, you may be considering:\nWheelchair accessible rental vans\nWheelchair accessible public transportation (buses, trains, subways)\nWheelchair accessible rideshares (Uber, Lyft, Taxis)\nIn this post you\u2019ll find some tips on how to navigate ground transportation while traveling, and we\u2019ll take a look at some of the different options a wheelchair user may have during their trip.\n\u2708\ufe0f This is for ground transportation specifically, but for an in-depth guide on flying as a wheelchair user, we covered that in this article.\nWheelchair accessible van with a ramp.\nFirst, Do Your Research\nIt is important to do thorough research well in advance to determine which route is the best for you. While some destinations may not provide many accessible rental vehicles or ride-shares, others offer exceptional wheelchair accessible public transportation, which may be the best option for traveling within the city. Places like San Fransisco, New York, and Europe as a whole have excellent public transportation. In either case, it is important to research as much as you can so you\u2019re well prepared and know what to expect.\nConnecting with other travelers can be a great resource for preparing for your trip. Ask questions, share your experiences, and connect with like-minded travelers in our Facebook group Wheel the World - Accessible Travel Community.\nWheelchair Accessible Vehicles (WAVs) \u267f\nWhat is a Wheelchair Accessible Vehicle(WAVs) and what does it mean? WAVs are specially designed (or adapted) vehicles of any kind that allows wheelchair users to enter and exit the vehicle with ease. These vehicles have lowered floors and a ramp or lift that allows the wheelchair to be rolled into the vehicle. The interior is designed to accommodate the wheelchair user, with features such as wheelchair tie-downs and accessible controls that allow the user to travel in their wheelchair safely. Some WAVs are also equipped with features such as hand controls for driving, power lifts, and transfer seats to make the transportation experience even more comfortable and convenient for the user.\nAccessible ramps into van.\nWheelchair Accessible Rental Van Services\nFor those who require more specialized transportation, accessible vans can be a great option. These vehicles are designed specifically to accommodate wheelchair users, with features such as wheelchair lifts and tie-downs. Accessible vans can be scheduled through phone or email.\nAt Wheel the World we work with several wheelchair accessible van providers in various destinations around the world, such as Morocco, Chile, Mexico, Costa Rica, France, Spain, Israel, and Qatar, to name a few.\n\u267f Need help with transportation, van rental, and/or insurance for your trip? Request a quote , hear back in less than one business day.\nWAV Options at Ride-Sharing Services\nRide-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft provide accessibility through their WAV option. Typically, the vehicles are minivans or something similar, and the rates are usually the same as a standard UberX. Keep in mind that these aren\u2019t available in every city, so if you\u2019re considering using ride-sharing on your trip, make sure you research to see if it\u2019s a viable option at your destination. At this time, some of the current cities where WAV is offered and has solid availability:\nNew York\nSan Francisco\nPortland\nBoston\nSeattle\nToronto\nWheelchair accessible transportation in Costa Rica\nAccessible Public Transportation\nMany public transportation systems offer wheelchair accessible options, such as buses and trains, while others offer paratransit services for those who are unable to use traditional public transportation. It is important to plan ahead and research the accessibility options in your area because not all public transportation systems are fully accessible.\nIn the U.S, public transportation is not accessible in every destination:\nBus transportation is accessible in almost every city, but can be very ineffective due to the lack of coverage in many cases. Research the bus routes at your destination and see if it would be a good option for you.\nThe San Francisco BART is almost 100% accessible. Every station has elevators, and although they are not very clean, it covers a majority of the city.\nOutside of the U.S there are many cities that we have identified with good public transportation. A few examples are:\nBarcelona, Spain - Great train and bus systems that are fully accessible.\nLondon, England - The buses have great accessibility and the Underground has a number of accessible stations, especially the ones around downtown.\nBerlin, Germany - Most subway stations are accessible.\nSantiago, Chile - The majority of subway stations and buses are accessible. Staying in the Vitacura/Providencia area of the city will allow you to use the subway and buses and go around accessible areas of the city.\nWheelchair lift into public transportation (bus)\nWheelchair Accessible Dispatch Taxis\nWheelchair-accessible dispatch taxi services are another great option for those who require specialized transportation. These services allow users to schedule a ride in an accessible taxi that has been designed to accommodate wheelchair users. These services can be scheduled in advance, allowing you to plan you transportation needs more conveniently. However, it's important to keep in mind that not every destination may offer these services, so it's important to research your options in advance.\nConclusion\nAlthough finding accessible transportation can be a challenge, there are several options available to wheelchair users. By exploring these alternatives, you can find the transportation option that works best for your needs and helps you maintain your independence and mobility. Remember to plan ahead, check availability, and always prioritize safety when traveling.

From minor annoyances to violent crimes, getting from point A to B can be fraught with risk.\nGoal 11 of the United Nations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sustainable development goals exhorts member states to provide safe, affordable, and accessible transportation for everyone, especially those who find themselves in vulnerable situations. And yet, while disparate initiatives have been launched around the world to make public commutes safer and accessible for everyone, a survey of the United Nations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and other international agencies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 research, plus our own analysis, suggests there is still more to be done across the three main stages of the commuter journey: planning and booking, the predeparture experience at boarding areas, and the travel itself.\nIn this article, we consider just how inclusive global public-transit systems are and explore ways that municipalities, urban planners, and other key stakeholders can assess and accommodate the end-to-end needs of all travelers.\nHow inclusive are our public-transit systems?\nOver the past decade, international organizations such as the United Nations have made the concerted effort to study inclusivity in urban-transport systems as a means to guarantee fair opportunities for all commuters. The insights that have come out of this endeavor fall under two broad themes.\nFirst, a collection of studies\u00e2\u0080\u0094including the UN Commission on the Status of Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Safe cities and safe public spaces for women and girls study\u00e2\u0080\u0094provide analyses of the key safety and communications issues that public-transport operators need to address. These include reducing violence and harassment on public transit, ensuring safer nighttime commutes, and providing clear, effective, around-the-clock communication between operators and travelers.\nSecond, a separate stream of research studies the main barriers that limit inclusion on public transit for women, people with disabilities, and low-income travelers, among others. Critical obstacles include, among others, poorly designed transportation, high ticket prices, inadequate safety regulations, and schedules that fail to account for the travel patterns of commuters with specific needs.\nAs they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve become aware of these issues and limitations, many public-transit system providers and urban planners have launched initiatives to address them\u00e2\u0080\u0094to limited effect, however. Such campaigns and programs have typically been introduced in an ad hoc manner rather than integrated into the overall public-transport system.\nSome cities, such as Los Angeles and Santiago, focused on surveying travel patterns of public-transit users, while others, including a major European capital and a large city in Southeast Asia, mostly worked on communication campaigns to raise awareness of nighttime safety. Other cities\u00e2\u0080\u0099 efforts were limited in scope. In Madrid, for example, on-demand bus stops were introduced on suburban routes during specific times to reduce the walking distance home for female passengers.\nFrom booking to travel: An end-to-end approach to inclusion\nShare From the inside out: Inclusion in the urban-transport workforce According to the latest Kantar Inclusion Index, less than half of transportation employees believe that their organizations are actively pursuing inclusion. In addition, the sector reports above-average workplace bullying/harassment and situations in which employees were made to feel uncomfortable. Fostering greater inclusion for public-transport employees requires providers to start with an accurate assessment of where they stand. Then, they can begin embarking on diversity, equity, and inclusion\u00c2 (DEI) transformation journeys to reshape their way of working. Diversity refers to workforce composition across various identity-related characteristics, such as gender, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, and disabilities. Equity focuses on ensuring that identity is not predictive of opportunities or workplace outcomes. Inclusion refers to the degree to which an individual feels that they can bring their authentic selves to work, enabling them to contribute in a meaningful and deliberate manner. From our experience working in this space, public-transport providers can gain DEI awareness in different ways. Sometimes targeted, eye-opening workshops aimed at uncovering deeply rooted unconscious bias represent a wake-up call for organizations: having diverse subsets of colleagues collaborate to identify unexpected biases in their ways of thinking is sometimes sufficient to trigger top-management engagement toward a new way of working. In other cases, transport agencies go even further and fully train their staff on civil-rights issues, among others, and on potential biases toward underrepresented categories. In other cases, achieving a profound understanding of the internal level of inclusivity can require more time and various sessions at all levels of the organization. Once companies agree that room for improvement exists, the journey to a fully inclusive work environment unfolds. After the first step of assessing and building the fact base through company-specific business cases, other challenging steps of the process remain: Architect (development of key performance indicators and road map): beginning with a solid awareness and understanding of the internal level of inclusion, companies develop a plan by designing a portfolio of initiatives linked to specific and tangible objectives, prioritizing them on feasibility and expected impact. The initiatives plan is complemented by the identification of pilots to be launched and tested, either on selected perimeters or on a company-wide basis.\nAct (test and learn with quick programs): companies start launching pilots and initiatives on target business units, functions, and geographies, in line with the agreed-upon implementation plan. As the plan unfolds, insights from pilots can be used to learn and refine ongoing and future initiatives.\nAdvance (build on success and track progress): in the core phase of the implementation, companies get the program to full scale. This requires a strong monitoring and accountability structure, alongside a proven knowledge codification and sharing system to constantly improve idea generation and the implementation of initiatives. Among public-transportation providers, one of the most notable programs in the past few years was launched by the roads and transport authority in a major city in the Middle East, which focused on including and elevating women\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, it created a dedicated fund for high-performing women employees and another initiative for \u00e2\u0080\u009cpeople of determination,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which included ad hoc employment and training programs.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time for urban-transport providers to draw from our collective understanding of inclusion and design and implement an urban-transport system that works for everyone. While this article focuses on the customer journey, travel providers should not miss the opportunity to transform their own organizations as well (see sidebar, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom the inside out: Inclusion in the urban-transport workforce\u00e2\u0080\u009d).\nTo further contribute to our existing understanding of travel and inclusion, we conducted our own research. We surveyed more than 20 different public-transport operators around the world and identified key requirements and initiatives for an inclusive public-transport system. We found that while there are many initiatives to enhance inclusion, they are typically not part of an integrated, 360-degree framework. We believe that a comprehensive and integrated approach to inclusive transportation comprises initiatives that fall into six categories (Exhibit 1).\n1\nWe mapped these requirements and initiatives along the commuter journey, which we broke down into three parts: the booking stage, the predeparture stage, and the actual travel experience (Exhibit 2). In each phase, there are actions travel providers can take to address specific pain points. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll explore those actions using the example of a rail-based journey\u00e2\u0080\u0094although the conceptual principles here can be applied to other forms of urban transport, such as buses and ferries.\n2\nThe booking stage\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s common nowadays for people to use navigation apps to find the most convenient route to their destination. The would-be passenger decides on the starting and arrival points, preferred mode of transport, and time of travel. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll factor in potential route disruptions (and explore alternatives, if necessary), how crowded the commute might be, and whether there are any loyalty-program benefits to be accrued.\nThis stage presents a number of potential pain points for some commuters. For instance, a wheelchair user may not know if a train station is equipped with elevators and if there are design barriers that may make it difficult to board and alight from a train.\nSome cities have tried to create a more accessible and safe experience for senior travelers. For instance, Salzburg has launched initiatives to promote the use of public transport among older people. The city has hosted \u00e2\u0080\u009cmobility days,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and pamphlets on commuter safety can be found in all train stations. Salzburg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bus drivers are also trained to be extra vigilant around older passengers, and vehicles are designed with senior citizens in mind. These initiatives have reduced accidents among older people and increased awareness among the remaining population.\nOur research points to a number of actions urban-transport providers can take at the booking and planning stage to create more inclusion. For instance, they could create pooling options in their travel apps so that passengers could choose to commute in groups. They may offer special rates at this stage as well, to disabuse people of the idea that accessible travel options are more expensive than standard ones. Passengers could also be given the option to easily share their itinerary with their friends and loved ones for an additional layer of oversight.\nTravel providers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 mobile apps may also provide a direct line of communication between the traveler and the provider and are a tool providers may want to use more strategically. Safety issues could be flagged immediately. Information about security measures, optimal travel times, and easy-access facilities could be relayed through this channel when passengers check and confirm their itinerary. The Transport for London, for instance, allows for just this with its dedicated journey planner; the app lets would-be passengers optimize their journey from the booking stage.\nPredeparture phase\nArriving at a station or terminal can be an overwhelming experience, with hordes of people crisscrossing in every possible direction\u00e2\u0080\u0094businesspeople rushing to catch their trains with barely minutes to spare, families trying to herd rowdy children toward the right platform, and buskers plying their craft.\nFor many, the predeparture phase looks like this: you receive a push notification from your travel provider with information about your train\u00e2\u0080\u0099s departure time. To get to the platform you go through a thermal-imaging scanner that checks your temperature, you make it past the turnstile with an electronic ticket, and you find the correct platform, where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll wait to board.\nFor groups or travelers with specific logistical needs, this phase can be full of hazards. If they are early for their train, for instance, such passengers may find few accessible waiting spaces to accommodate them.\nThere are a number of ways urban-travel providers can improve the predeparture experience for all travelers. They may want to integrate important safety and pooling information into the departure reminder, noting the location of accessible facilities and safe train cars\u00e2\u0080\u0094carriages with an attendant, conductor, or security officer. Visual \u00e2\u0080\u009cnudges\u00e2\u0080\u009d and cues could promote positive behaviors, such as offering assistance to people with mobility constraints or to pregnant women. In stations where longer wait times are common, more rooms for nursing mothers and a greater number of dedicated waiting areas could be created. Treating the station as a civic space by promoting community-focused activities\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as increasing retail outlets and installing open pianos\u00e2\u0080\u0094could also enhance commuters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sense of safety.\nIn 2006, the city of Graz, Austria, upgraded its key stops to make them both more accessible and livable; and, targeting both safety and comfort in its train platforms and stations, the Canadian cities of Ottawa and Toronto created designated Transecure waiting areas.\nTraveling and arriving at the destination\nThere are a number of actions travel providers can take to make passengers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 journeys inclusive once they are on board. For instance, it is possible for travelers on most trains to track their progress while en route\u00e2\u0080\u0094but it may not always be clear how to request help in cases of violence of harassment. Particularly when it comes to late-night routes, passengers may be in near-empty train cars. To provide peace of mind for all passengers, urban-travel planners should install highly visible GPS panic buttons throughout the system, as they have in New Delhi and Bangalore.\nCommuters with specific needs could be directed to the train\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safe wagons with security personnel and closer supervision. Pregnant women or passengers with specific physical needs could wear \u00e2\u0080\u009cMay I sit\u00e2\u0080\u009d pins to alert other commuters to give way to them. Travel providers could also make it easier for these commuters to find information about connections and the safest ways to get to the next boarding point.\nWhile our case study focuses on rail travel, alternative transport modes may offer other opportunities for greater inclusion. The flexibility afforded by bus travel presents more options for making the travel experience safer. Passengers could be allowed to alight, on request, at specific time slots, for example, from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m., to reduce the distance between the drop-off point to the final destination. This is exactly what the city of Madrid put in place, arranging on-demand night bus stops on interurban bus lines.\nCreating an inclusive urban-transport system doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop the moment a passenger gets off the train. Transport providers could review the arrival experiences and partner with security companies to provide additional support or with taxi and rideshare companies to provide special rates for arriving passengers.\nSetting the goal of an entirely accessible public-transport system is becoming increasingly common in major cities worldwide. Barcelona has committed to a 100 percent accessible underground metro system by 2024, and Seattle is already fully wheelchair accessible.\nOther municipalities and travel providers can do the same by undertaking a thorough assessment of customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 needs along the whole journey, mapping the potential pain points, and implementing targeted initiatives to address them. Of course, this process is an iterative one; any initiatives launched should be evaluated and refined over time. The systemic, end-to-end approach outlined in this article should help make traveling in our cities truly safer for all."}, {"title": "Improving Transport Accessibility for All: Guide to Good Practice", "article": "Making transport vehicles and infrastructure more accessible to everyone continues to be both an important objective and a major challenge for transport authorities, operators and service providers worldwide.\nAccessibility has long been considered as a transport concern only for individuals with particular mobility diffi culties.

They can help you get destination-specific vaccines, medicines, and information. Discussing your health concerns, itinerary, and planned activities with your provider allows them to give more specific advice and recommendations.\nGet travel insurance. Find out if your health insurance covers medical care abroad. Travelers are usually responsible for paying hospital and other medical expenses out of pocket at most destinations. Make sure you have a plan to get care overseas, in case you need it. Consider buying additional insurance that covers health care and emergency evacuation, especially if you will be traveling to remote areas.\nEnroll with the Department of State\u2019s Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP).

Consider renting a wheelchair and any medical equipment at your destination. Websites such as Mobility International USA and the European Network for Accessible Tourism provide information on overseas medical equipment providers.\nConsiderations for Air Travel\nU.S. airlines and flights to or from the United States on a foreign carrier must provide all travelers with the same travel opportunities, regardless of disability, unless doing so would endanger the health or safety of other passengers and crew.\nSome airlines may require up to 48 hours advance notice and 1-hour advance check-in for certain accommodations. Check with your airline for more information. Airlines are required to provide people with disabilities access to the aircraft, an aisle seat, and a seat with a removable armrest.\nIf you plan to fly within a foreign country or between countries while abroad, the regulations above might not apply. Check with the airline to find out what accommodations it makes for people with disabilities.\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation has a toll-free hotline, 800-778-4838 (voice) or 800-455-9880 (TTY), for more information about the rights of air travelers with disabilities. Also, check federal relay 711 or the Transportation Security Administration\u2019s website for answers to questions about screening policies, procedures, and checkpoints. Find out if there are specific policies for devices such as wheelchairs, portable machines, batteries, respirators, and oxygen.\nConsiderations for Cruise Ship Travel\nMost cruise ships can accommodate travelers with disabilities. Check with the cruise line before booking to make sure any accommodations you\u2019ll need are available, such as medical oxygen or a wheelchair. Some cruises cater to travelers with special needs, such as patients on dialysis.\nTraveling with Service Animals\nMost airlines allow a trained service animal to accompany a qualified individual with a disability. Be sure to check with your airline to ensure that your service animal meets the airline\u2019s requirements, including necessary documentation. Service animals may not be allowed to enter all countries and are subject to animal importation regulations, such as quarantine regulations. Your service animal will also be subject to US animal import regulations when flying to the United States. Prior to traveling with your service animal, find out what documents and testing may be required to enter another country and return to the United States.\nContact the US embassy or consulate of the destination country for information on possible restrictions for service animals and any quarantine, vaccination, and documentation requirements.\nConsult a veterinarian prior to your trip and ask about tips for traveling with service animals.\nContact destination hotels to make sure they will allow service animals.\nAfter Travel\nIf you traveled and feel sick, particularly if you have a fever, talk to a healthcare provider and tell them about your travel. If you need medical care abroad, see Getting Health Care During Travel.\nMore Information"}, {"title": "Travelers with Disabilities", "article": "Air Travel Regulations & Standards\nAir Carrier Access Act\nIn 1986, Congress passed the Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA) to ensure that people with disabilities are treated without discrimination in a way consistent with the safe carriage of all air passengers. These regulations were established by the US Department of Transportation (DOT) and apply to all flights provided by US airlines and flights to or from the United States by foreign carriers.\nACAA ensures carriers cannot refuse transportation based on a disability. The ACAA has a few exceptions, however; for example, the carrier can refuse transportation if the person with a disability would endanger the health or safety of other passengers or if transporting the person would be a violation of Federal Aviation Administration safety rules. Travelers and their clinicians can learn more about exceptions and other aspects of the ACAA by reviewing What Airline Employees, Airline Contractors, and Air Travelers with Disabilities Need to Know about Access to Air Travel for Persons with Disabilities (see Table 3-05 for link). Air carriers are also obliged to accept a declaration by travelers with disabilities that they are self-reliant. A medical certificate (a written statement from the traveler\u2019s health care provider saying that the traveler can complete the flight safely without requiring extraordinary medical care or endangering other travelers) might be required in specific situations. Examples of specific situations include a person intending to travel with a possible communicable disease, a person requiring a stretcher or oxygen, or a person whose medical condition can be reasonably expected to affect the operation of the flight. Under the guidelines of the ACAA, when a traveler with disability requests assistance, the airline is obliged to meet certain accessibility requirements. For example, carriers must provide access to the aircraft door (preferably by a level entry bridge), an aisle seat, and a seat with removable armrests. However, aircraft with <30 seats generally are exempt from these requirements. Any aircraft with >60 seats must have an onboard wheelchair, and personnel must help move the onboard wheelchair from a seat to the lavatory area upon request. Only wide-body aircraft with \u22652 aisles are required to have fully accessible lavatories.\nAirline personnel are not required to assist with feeding, visiting the lavatory, or dispensing medication to travelers. Travelers with disabilities who require this type of assistance should travel with a companion or attendant. DOT maintains a toll-free hotline (800-778-4838 [voice] or 800-455-9880 [TTY]), available 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday\u2013Friday, except federal holidays, to provide general information to consumers about the rights of air travelers with disabilities and to assist air travelers with time-sensitive disability-related issues.\nMany non\u2013US airlines voluntarily adhere to codes of practice that are similar to US legislation based on guidelines from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO; see Table 3-05). These guidelines are not identical to those outlined in US legislation, however, and the degree of implementation can vary by airline and location. Travelers planning to fly between foreign countries or within a foreign country while abroad should check with the overseas airlines to ensure that the carriers adhere to accessibility standards adequate for their needs. ICAO (see Table 3-05) also provides accessibility scores for airports across the world that can aid in travel planning.\nAssistive Devices\nAssistive devices can make traveling more accessible for people with disabilities. Travelers and their health care providers can consult the DOT and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) websites (see Table 3-05) for information on traveling with an assistive device. Travelers should check for specific policies for assistive devices, including wheelchairs, portable machines, batteries, respirators, and portable oxygen concentrators.\nIn-Flight Services\nAirlines are not permitted to require travelers to provide advance notice of a disability. Airlines might require up to 48 hours advance notice and 1-hour advance check-in, however, for certain accommodations that require preparation time for services (if they are available on the flight), such as medical oxygen for use on board the aircraft, carriage of an incubator, hook-up for a respirator to the aircraft electrical power supply, accommodation for a passenger who must travel in a stretcher, transport of a battery-powered wheelchair on an aircraft with <60 seats, provision by the airline of hazardous material packaging for batteries used in wheelchairs or other assistive devices, accommodation for \u226510 people with disabilities who travel as a group, or provision of an onboard wheelchair for use on an aircraft that does not have an accessible lavatory.\nAll audiovisual displays played on aircraft for safety and informational purposes must use captioning or a sign language interpreter as part of the video presentation. The captioning must be in the predominant languages in which the carrier communicates with passengers on the flight. The current ACAA rule does not require the captioning of in-flight entertainment.\nAirport Accommodations\nSecurity Screening\nThe TSA has established a program for screening travelers with disabilities and their equipment, mobility aids, and devices. TSA permits prescription liquid medications and other liquids needed by people with disabilities and medical conditions. Travelers with disabilities or medical conditions that affect TSA screening might use a TSA Notification Card to communicate with screening officers; they can also learn more about TSA guidelines for disabilities and medical conditions online (see Table 3-05).\nAs with other people with disabilities or medical conditions, travelers with hearing loss (i.e., individuals who are deaf or who are hard of hearing) can provide the TSA officer with a notification card or other medical documentation that describes their condition and informs the officer about the need for assistance with the screening process. Travelers are not required to remove any hearing aids or external cochlear implant devices. Additional screening, including a pat-down or device inspection, might be required if assistive devices alarm security technology.\nTravelers with disabilities or medical conditions can call the TSA helpline toll free at 855-787-2227, federal relay 711, or check TSA's website for answers to questions about screening policies, procedures, and the security checkpoints.\nClosed Captioning\nAs part of the ACAA, DOT rules require any airport terminal facility that receives federal financial assistance to enable or ensure high-contrast captioning at all times on televisions and other audiovisual displays. Captioning is required on televisions and other audiovisual displays located in any common area of the terminal to which passengers have access, including the gate area, ticketing area, passenger lounges, and leased commercial shop and restaurant spaces.\nTelecommunication Devices\nCurrent ACAA rules require people with hearing loss to self-identify to airline carrier personnel to ensure their receipt of accessible information. Passenger information, including information about flight schedule changes, connections, gate assignments, and baggage claim must be transmitted in a timely manner through an accessible method of communication to those who have identified themselves as having hearing loss.\nPassengers with hearing loss must identify themselves to carrier personnel at the gate area or the customer service desk even if they have already done so at the ticketing area. The ACAA rules do not require a sign language interpreter to ensure that a passenger with hearing loss receives all pertinent information. If an airline carrier provides telephone reservation and information service to the public, these services must be available to people with hearing loss through a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD), telecommunications relay services, or other technology.\nWheelchairs\nTravelers can decide to rent wheelchairs and medical equipment at their destination. Research on renting wheelchairs might include checking the availability of wheelchair and medical equipment providers. In addition, organizations such as Mobility International USA have information about overseas medical equipment providers. The country voltage, type of electrical plug, and reliability of the electrical infrastructure at the destination country might make one type of wheelchair preferable over another. In some cases, a manual instead of a power wheelchair is the preferred assistive device.\nBoarding & Deplaning with a Wheelchair\nSmaller airplanes might not have a jetway, and travelers who use wheelchairs might need to be manually lifted or carried down the stairs. Some airports have adapted hoists or lifts. An aisle chair is usually required to board and deplane an airplane. Travelers should be sure to mention they need an aisle chair, both when reserving tickets and when checking in at the airport. Additional wheelchair traveling tips are available through Wheelchair Travel\u2019s Wheelchair Users\u2019 Guide to Air Travel.\nService Animals\nSome travelers require a service animal for travel support. Travelers who require service animals, including emotional support animals, should check with the airline and the destination country to ensure that both will permit the animal and that the traveler obtains all required documentation (see Sec. 7, Ch. 6, Traveling with Pets & Service Animals). Clinicians can use the following recommendations to assist travelers with service animals. Travelers can contact the foreign embassy or consulate of the destination country for information on possible restrictions and cultural norms about service animals. Travelers should find out about any required quarantine, vaccination, and documentation for the service animal; consult their veterinarian for tips about traveling with service animals; and contact destination hotels to make certain they will accommodate service animals.\nCruise Ships\nCompanies or entities conducting programs or tours on cruise ships that dock at US ports have obligations regarding access for travelers with disabilities, even if the ship itself is of foreign registry, as outlined in Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act. All travelers with disabilities should check with cruise lines regarding availability of requested or needed items before booking. Cruise ship operators and travel agents that cater to travelers with special needs also exist.\nMedical Considerations\nSome travelers can have both a disability and an underlying health condition. Box 3-02 provides a list of suggestions the travel health provider can use to help the traveler plan to manage their condition while abroad. For more details, refer to Sec. 3, Ch. 3, Travelers with Chronic Illnesses."}, {"title": "Accommodations", "article": "Under Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), a reasonable accommodation is a modification or adjustment to a job, the work environment, or the way things are usually done during the hiring process. These modifications enable an individual with a disability to have an equal opportunity not only to get a job, but successfully perform their job tasks to the same extent as people without disabilities. The ADA requires reasonable accommodations as they relate to three aspects of employment: 1) ensuring equal opportunity in the application process; 2) enabling a qualified individual with a disability to perform the essential functions of a job; and 3) making it possible for an employee with a disability to enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment.\nAccommodations are sometimes referred to as \u201cproductivity enhancers\u201d. Reasonable accommodations should not be viewed as \u201cspecial treatment\u201d and they often benefit all employees. For example, facility enhancements such as ramps, accessible restrooms, and ergonomic workstations benefit more than just employees with disabilities. Examples of reasonable accommodations include making existing facilities accessible; job restructuring; part-time or modified work schedules; acquiring or modifying equipment; changing tests, training materials, or policies; and providing qualified readers or interpreters. Here are some more examples. Many job accommodations cost very little and often involve minor changes to a work environment, schedule or work-related technologies:\nPhysical changes Installing a ramp or modifying a rest room Modifying the layout of a workspace\nAccessible and assistive technologies Ensuring computer software is accessible Providing screen reader software Using videophones to facilitate communications with colleagues who are deaf\nAccessible communications Providing sign language interpreters or closed captioning at meetings and events Making materials available in Braille or large print\nPolicy enhancements Modifying a policy to allow a service animal in a business setting Adjusting work schedules so employees with chronic medical conditions can go to medical appointments and complete their work at alternate times or locations\nThese are just a few example.

In disability employment antidiscrimination law and policy, perhaps the most important driver of the inclusion command is the \u201caccommodation principle,\u201d which requires that employers make reasonable adjustments to tasks and places of work to enable full and equal participation by qualified individuals with disabilities [2].\nIn the seminal 2004 U.S. Supreme Court case Tennessee v. Lane [3], the late Justice Ruth Ginsburg wrote of the centrality of the ADA\u2019s accommodation principle:\nIncluding individuals with disabilities among people who count in composing \u201cWe the People,\u201d Congress understood in shaping the ADA, would sometimes require not blindfolded equality, but responsiveness to difference; not indifference, but accommodation. Central to the Act\u2019s primary objective, Congress extended the statute\u2019s range to reach all government activities, [], and required \u2026 \u201creasonable accommodations.\u201d\nUnder the ADA, the word \u201cdiscriminate\u201d consequently includes failure to make reasonable accommodations to the physical and mental limitations of a qualified individual with a disability, in the absence of an \u201cundue hardship\u201d on the business [1]. Discrimination includes denying opportunities to a job applicant or employee if such denial is based on the need for the entity to make reasonable accommodations to that person\u2019s physical or mental conditions [1]. By directing employers to accept responsibility, within reason, for accommodations (up to the undue hardship ceiling), the ADA\u2019s Title I sets the ADA apart from other U.S. civil rights legislation.\nThe importance of the accommodation principle to disability inclusive employment law and policy is manifest [4]. The goal of offering equal employment opportunity to everyone, regardless of disability, is meaningless if the new hire uses a wheelchair and the sole entrance to the workplace is up a flight of stairs. The right to work rings hollow if people who are deaf or hard of hearing, who are blind or have low vision, or who have reading or cognitive disabilities cannot use or access a company\u2019s web-based technologies [5]. Opportunity is foreclosed when an employer will not alter work schedules within reason, or bars telework or remote work, without consideration for qualified individuals with episodic or mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety, that require flexibility [6].\nTitle I of the ADA defines the accommodation principle to include, within reason, making facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, as well as job restructuring, part-time and modified work schedules, remote work and telecommuting, modification of equipment and devices, and other effective means of enabling qualified individuals with disabilities to perform essential functions of their jobs, whether traditional or non-traditional [1]. The ADA gives substantial weight to an employer\u2019s definition of \u201cessential\u201d job functions and the extent to which such tasks may be done effectively with accommodation.\nResearch shows the low costs and the numerous benefits of the accommodation principle. Most workplace accommodations incur de minimis or near-zero costs [7,8,9,10]. Employers in most cases can accommodate people with disabilities with relative ease, formally or informally. Further, there are far-reaching, positive ripple effects from a \u201cculture of accommodation\u201d for all [11, 12]. At the organizational level, accommodations improve employee productivity, morale, and tenure. If an organization promotes a \u201cculture of inclusion,\u201d a climate of flexible and supportive approaches, it furthers effective and innovative accommodations and productive outcomes for all employees and for itself [9, 10, 13,14,15], and it enjoys the benefits of attracting and retaining qualified workers [13]. The ripple effect extends even further: promoting economic opportunity for people with disabilities produces a corresponding decrease in their need for federal disability insurance and other governmental support funding, along with a resultant increase in tax revenues.\nThe research thus suggests the value, to all of society, of documenting, devising, and promoting strategies to increase awareness and implementation of the accommodation principle across organizations of different sizes and types, and across market and labor sectors.\nAt the thirtieth anniversary of the ADA, the articles in this special topic section consider, variously, the future of disability-inclusive employment in light of how the accommodation principle works in contemporary society, and in light of its historical precedents. The accommodation principle as part of a disability inclusive employment paradigm is a concept of the late twentieth century. It contrasts with earlier vocational rehabilitation programs for people with disabilities, which historically were based on medicalized conceptions of disability [1, 16]. This \u201cMedical Model\u201d of disability focused on individual deficits, with impairments conceived of as infirmities that precluded participation in the mainstream economy [17, 18]. It cast people with disabilities in a subordinate role to doctors, rehabilitation professionals, and governmental bureaucrats, each of whom aimed to \u201chelp them,\u201d when \u201cdeserving,\u201d adjust to a society structured around the convenience, design, and interests of people without disabilities [17].\nIn contrast, the modern model is the Social Model of disability, which is sometimes called the Ecological Model, and, in the context of the ADA, the Disability Civil Rights Model. This model, however named, includes the accommodation principle. It has changed society\u2019s perspective. It has altered the historical paradigm from a focus on a health status to be cured or rehabilitated, and even pitied, towards acceptance of individual differences as human traits that are accommodated in employment, and generally in society, as a natural part of the human experience.\nThe Social Model of disability has taken on exceptional importance due to the health and economic emergency arising from the global pandemic [19, 20]. The pandemic is challenging public and private entities in unprecedented ways to spur both traditional and new forms of employment and economic opportunity for all. But people with disabilities are presently experiencing among the highest rates of job loss, as compared to those without disabilities, from the health and economic emergency [21, 22].\nLest we forget, too, people with disabilities often own or identify with multiple minority identities that are themselves marginalized in our society. People with disabilities, for example, may also be women, people of color, and/or individuals identifying with different sexual orientations and gender identities [23,24,25]. Disability diversity and inclusion (\u201cD&I\u201d) programs that incorporate the accommodation principle for all identities\u2014what my colleagues call \u201cD&I+\u201d\u2014are crucial to people with disabilities who seek to enter or re-enter the mainstream economy."}, {"title": null, "article": null}, {"title": "Accommodations: What they are and how they work", "article": "You may hear the term modification.

Moreover, the analysis underlines that tourism locations should be designed to be useable by all people, drawing on the principles of the universal design.\nThis paper is developed as a conceptual contribution, drawing also on an illustrative example that considers a tourist with mobility disability as the focal actor.\nDespite a growing interest in accessible tourism, delivering high-quality tourism experiences to people with disabilities (PwD) remains a major challenge. Beyond a number of acknowledged barriers (e.g. cultural, architectural, relational), the main issue is the lack of coordination amongst the many actors participating in the co-creation of tourism experiences. This paper intends to advance available knowledge on this issue by conceptually suggesting a solution that draws on the concepts of the tourism experience and digital ecosystems.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020, Fabio Cassia, Paola Castellani, Chiara Rossato and Claudio Baccarani\nPublished by Emerald Publishing Limited.

Tourism experience and tourism ecosystem from perspective of tourists with mobility disability 4.1 Mapping the tourism experience through the tourism customer journey The tourism customer journey (TCJ) involves mapping the entire journey of a tourist, outlining all the stages a person goes through when experiencing the need to move for tourism purposes (\u00c5str\u00f8m, 2020). The TCJ draws on the more general concept of the customer journey, which is the \u201cprocess a customer goes through, across all stages and touch points, that makes up the customer experience\u201d (Lemon and Verhoef, 2016, p. 71). Mapping customer journeys is a popular and effective way to grasp the entire tourism customer experience (Rosenbaum et al., 2017). If the tourism product as a whole was offered by one single company, the general customer journey concept could be easily applied to tourism in the same way as it is applied to other kinds of services (e.g. banking, retail and insurance services). However, as will be discussed shortly, tourism is a more complex service because of the number and variety of co-creating actors and the relationships amongst them. Here, we apply the TCJ to the context of people with mobility disability. A similar analysis could be applied to people with other disabilities (Al\u00e9n et al., 2012), resulting in different and specific types of TCJs. Given the complexity of applying a contextual study to all types of disabilities, this study focusses only on people with mobility disability, but the same method of analysis could be easily extended and replicated. From the very beginning of the TCJ, even when individuals are planning their holiday, they will encounter a series of actors, whose number will dramatically increase in the subsequent stages of the journey (Buhalis, 2000; Saraniemi and Kyl\u00e4nen, 2011). This is because tourism involves a complex ecosystem that has many actors who influence to a greater or lesser extent the experience perceived by individuals during their journey (Gretzel et al., 2016). The quality delivered by each actor clearly influences the overall quality of the tourist's overall experience (Ciasullo, 2017). Sometimes this phenomenon is emphasised because the quality performance of one provider has a spillover effect on the customer's evaluation of the quality performance of other components of (or actors in) the tourism ecosystem (Bourdeau et al., 2007). That is, a negative performance in one part of the journey may have a negative halo effect on the entire journey, considering that the tourist (beyond being the focal actor of the ecosystem) (Storbacka et al., 2016) is the only actor to see all the components of the ecosystem. Similarly, a positive performance in one of the moments of truth (Normann, 2001) has the potential to compensate for a series of negative performances in other parts of the journey. Overall, there is a remarkable risk of tourist dissatisfaction, which is heightened when the person undertaking the journey has some form of disabilities, such as when they have reduced mobility. These arguments can be illustrated through the construction of the TCJ for a holiday that is independently conceived and designed by a person with mobility disability who has time to spend in a destination to be selected and does not want to rely on standardised offerings delivered by tour operators. For this purpose, we draw on the general framework suggested by Baccarani and Cassia (2017), according to which a holiday is articulated and occurs in the following four main stages (Figure 1): destination choice and trip design; outbound trip; staying at the destination; transfer to another destination or return home. Each of the four stages of the TCJ develops through the processes that are outlined below. The points marked with the sign (*) in the following list represent critical aspects for people with mobility disability because they can entail various problems related to accessibility because of the presence of architectural, communication, cultural, technological and relational barriers. The first stage of the TCJ \u2013 destination choice and trip design \u2013 encompasses the formation of a tourist's experiential expectations drawing on the following elements: time available for the journey, motivations triggering the need for the journey, any previous personal holiday experiences, any previous indirect holiday experiences (e.g. information collected online, online reviews and e-word-of-mouth), dialogue and interactions with disability organisations and associations, information available online or printed specialised magazines and publications, information available in promotional materials delivered by tourism destinations, means of transportation available and reservation of such transportation (*), type of accommodations available and reservation of such lodgings (*), definition of a hierarchy of suitable destinations (*). The second stage of the TCJ \u2013 outbound trip \u2013 covers the most complex part of the holiday. In fact, the anticipated benefits of the planned holiday take shape during this stage. In the case that the tourist uses a personally owned means of transport suitable for their disability to reach the boarding point and that the travel is done by aeroplane, this stage includes the following elements: printing the boarding pass, estimating the time that they must leave home to reach the airport (this estimation is informed by customers' sensitivity to risk and the information available), preparing their luggage, planning which road or highways to take to reach the airport, stopping at rest areas to meet their needs or the needs of others or to comply with the requirements of the transport providers (*), parking in an area near the airport (*), checking in their luggage (*), reaching the boarding point (*), complying with any safety control procedures (*), waiting at a boarding gate (*), boarding the aeroplane (*), flying to the destination (*), disembarking and claiming their luggage (*), searching for a local means of transport to reach the accommodation facility (*), arriving and being welcomed at the accommodation facility (*). The third stage of the TCJ \u2013 staying at the destination \u2013 represents the core of the holiday with all that a person desired for their time away on holiday. This is a stage of personal enhancement in relation to seeking knowledge, values and relationships. During this stage, the core value of the holiday emerges and is influenced, at least in the beginning, by the travel experience, which may increase or diminish the initial enthusiasm. This stage encompasses the following points and involves a variety of actors at the destination: planning itineraries, visits and activities that the tourists wish to engage in at the destination based on their previous knowledge and the information available to them, visiting cultural, artistic and natural sites in an area (*), forming relationships with the host community (*), selecting from a variety of foods and eateries on offer (*), participating in local guided tours (e.g. wine tours) (*), using local means of transport (*), purchasing souvenirs. The fourth stage of the TCJ \u2013 transfer to another place or return back home \u2013 is similar to stages two and three described above, and includes the overall evaluation of the perceived quality in relation to the expected quality developed in stage one. In addition to the steps described above, which imply a variety of relationships between the tourist and several different actors, the context of a holiday is even more complex because tourist safety and care must be specifically assured, particularly for PwD. These conditions must be guaranteed by higher-level welfare systems, with which the tourism service network should be able to cooperate effectively. In summary, in this TCJ the tourist benefits from a variety of services that globally support the creation of the tourism experience, which is phenomenologically determined and perceived by the beneficiary (i.e. the tourist) (Vargo and Lusch, 2016). 4.2 Identifying the tourism ecosystem in relation to tourists with mobility disability This subsection identifies the actors that form the complex tourism ecosystem in its co-creation of the tourism experience. During each of the four stages of the TCJ, many different actors contribute to the formation of the overall tourist experience by delivering or not delivering the expected quality. In the tourist's experience, all these actors form a tourism service ecosystem, even if they represent only a set of services that the customer has assembled (Baccarani and Cassia, 2017). In fact, a service ecosystem implies a self-contained, self-adjusting system of resource-integrating actors connected by shared institutional arrangements and mutual value creation (Vargo and Lusch, 2016). However, this level of coordination amongst all the actors involved in the co-creation of tourism experience does not yet exist. Below, we outline the actors involved in each of the four stages of the TCJ. In the first stage, the tourist imagines, designs, plans and anticipates the pleasure of their holiday. To complete this stage, the tourist relies on the information provided by actors such as airlines and accommodation providers and interact with them directly or through intermediaries. For people with mobility disability, the dialogue and interactions with disability organisations and associations play an important role. As highlighted by the UNWTO, disabled peoples' organisations (DPOs) play a key role in accessible tourism because \u201cthey are mediators in understanding specific needs, existent barriers and the ways to bridge them\u201d (UNWTO, 2020). At this first stage of the TCJ (destination choice and trip design), quality is evaluated on the basis of the completeness and clarity of the information provided by multiple actors. All the actors involved in this first stage of the TCJ represent the holiday-design ecosystem (see Figure 3). In the second stage of the TCJ (outbound trip), at least the following 12 actors are involved, and this number could be even higher if a tourist decides to use public means of transport (instead of a personally owned means on transport): producers of publications or websites and intermediaries distributing information that guides the tourist in selecting the destination during the season in which the journey takes place; booking organisations through their websites; transport providers, including those preparing the service timetable; highways operators who have information about roadworks and any related delays; firms executing the roadworks who have information about any interruptions that may affect the roadworks and travel times; firms managing the rest areas and a variety of other services that may be required; firms managing the parking areas who may assist customers to reach their boarding point after having parked their vehicle; airport company that manages the departure airport that offers a welcome service and controls safety processes; airline that is responsible for checking in passengers, assigning boarding gates, flying times and delivering baggage; airport company that manages the arrival airport that offers welcome services and provides information to customers and about local means of transport; local transport service operators; accommodation services providers. Therefore, a tourist interacts with at least 12 different co-creating actors during the second stage of the TCJ. These actors are connected in the tourist's mind but they are practically linked only through market relations and they do not coordinate their decisions and behaviours. Thus, it is unlikely that the tourist will be able to complete the second stage without experiencing some level of difficulty. For example, the tourist may miss the flight because of planned roadwork not being properly notified in advance or because of other unforeseen events. To evaluate the quality of the overall experience, the tourist considers all the components of this stage of the TCJ, comparing expected and actual quality. In particular, the tourist will appreciate the problem-solving capability of the actors. This second group of actors represents the travel ecosystem (see Figure 3). In the third stage of the TCJ (staying at the destination), the tourist stays at the chosen destination where they interact with at least the following actors: firms who manage welcome and accommodation services; restaurateurs; local inhabitants (local community); local transport service operators; local merchants with their value propositions; agencies who organise local tours so that customers can explore local traditions, culture and products; municipalities; organisations protecting tourists' safety and care. This third stage of the TCJ has fewer actors than the second stage. However, the variety of actors is greater because during the tourist's stay at the destination, the tourist will engage in activities such as trying different types of food offerings to appreciate the local food culture, which means they will have contact and engage with more actors. Similarly, to explore local artistic, natural and cultural heritage, the tourist will select from a variety of opportunities that are available at the destination. In the third stage of the TCJ, the local community also plays a fundamental role in welcoming tourists and in co-creating their tourism experiences. In fact, in addition to the technical and functional\u2013relational components of the quality delivered by local services (Gr\u00f6nroos, 1990; Kang and James, 2004), the welcoming atmosphere experienced at the destination plays a central role in the formation of the overall perceived quality (Nunkoo and Ramkissoon, 2011). All the actors involved in the third stage of the TCJ represent the staying at destination ecosystem (see Figure 3). The fourth stage (transfer to another place or return back home) is a replication of the stages two and three outlined above and encompasses the tourist's comparison between the overall perceived quality and the expected quality developed in stage one. The actors that populate the tourism service ecosystem are largely the same for tourists with and without disabilities. However, tourists with disabilities can select amongst a smaller number of offerings than tourists without disabilities. Moreover, actors are required to have adequate technical and relational skills to deliver tourism services to tourists with disabilities. Thus, tourists with disabilities must face greater difficulties in their travel-related choices because of the presence of several types of barriers (see Figure 2). The tourism ecosystem described in this sub-section is depicted in Figure 3. The quality of the tourism experience emerges from the relationships established within this tourism ecosystem through which resources are combined and value is co-created. Such relationships have different degrees of smoothness depending on the presence of several barriers.\n5. Barriers to accessible tourism: can digital ecosystems represent a solution? Drawing on the arguments developed so far, this section identifies in detail the barriers to fulfilling tourism experience co-creation for PwD. The intention of the discussion is to understand whether and how digital ecosystems could represent a viable solution to such barriers. The identified relationships amongst the co-creating actors have not been harmonised to deliver the overall quality desired by the tourist because they are regulated by pure competitive mechanisms, emphasising the value of a specific part of the ecosystem instead of the value of the entire ecosystem. However, in tourism, competition amongst companies of the same sector can exist only once a territory as a whole is attractive. As highlighted in several studies (Baccarani et al., 2019; Barnes, 2004), the territory is not a physical space, but a highly complex viable subject emerging from all co-creations over time through the interactions between nature and human beings. Thus, the territory emerges from the relational synergies between the people who inhabit it and the environment. Therefore, the stronger the synergies established in a certain location, the higher the location's attractiveness and value, which then make the location a platform in which individual actors can compete against each other with their propositions. That is, the long-term attractiveness of a territory and of a tourism destination derives from the actions of the entire ecosystem, within which the actors must aim to do their best through a continuous dialogue with the territorial ecosystem. For this purpose, tourism must be conceived in a holistic manner by deploying planning efforts that involve all the actors of the ecosystem and engage all the potential beneficiaries of the tourism offering \u2013 be they are tourists with or without disabilities (Darcy et al., 2020). This perspective cannot ignore a series of barriers that determine biases in the co-creation of a location that provides tourism services for all tourists and particularly for those with mobility disability. In detail, the following barriers to accessible tourism can be identified (Gillovic et al., 2018; Michopoulou et al., 2020; Nyanjom et al., 2018): informational barriers; architectural barriers; political barriers; cultural barriers; relational barriers; technological barriers; entrepreneurial myopia. These barriers are outlined below from the perspective of PwD. Informational barriers refer to the difficulties that a person with disabilities faces when desiring to autonomously evaluate and choose a means of transport, accommodation, a holiday itinerary or simple holiday activities such as shopping. While there is usually a great deal of information is available for such services, informational needs of PwD leads to higher levels of complexity. For example, even when information about tourism services is available it can difficult to verify. Architectural barriers refer to the obstacles PwD encounter on holiday when engaging in activities such as accessing means of transport, moving in different locations, and using sidewalks and roads. Inconveniences related to architectural barriers can often also be experienced by people without disabilities (e.g. finding it difficult to understand the subway system) but the barriers are emphasised for PwD. Architectural barriers are directly connected to political barriers, which refer to the needs of PwD in the context of a political agenda. While political discourses highlight the ideal of acting to eliminate architectural barriers, political actions are often guided by urgency, short-termism and narrow-sighted electoral benefits. Cultural barriers refer to the indifference that can characterise the behaviour of all people of all abilities (Gillovic et al., 2018) towards PwD. This barrier is manifest in factors such as the lack of respect for PwD parking slots. Relational barriers refer to the general population viewing PwD from a self-righteous perspective, believing that the PwD cannot live a full life, even within the constraints of the experienced impairments. Technological barriers refer to the speed of the technological change related to means of transport and communication, which can create difficult situations for those who do not keep up with the ongoing changes. Entrepreneurial myopia refers to the inability to appreciate the size and value of the tourism market for PwD and of changes occurring in public opinion. This myopia is in tension with the ideals of sustainability provided by Agenda 2030 (United Nations, 2015), which explicitly highlights the need to promote sustainability and inclusivity and to empower PwD (e.g. points 11 and 23 of Agenda 2030) and by the Global Code of Ethics for Tourism (UNWTO, 2001), which states the \u201cright to tourism\u201d (article 7). When accessible tourism experiences are designed, it is important to avoid ad-hoc solutions aimed exclusively at PwD (Scheyvens and Biddulph, 2018). Following the principles of universal design (Michopoulou et al., 2020), tourism providers should in fact enable experiences that are useable by all people, with or without disabilities. This approach is consistent with the idea that tourism carries a value that makes it a public service, interpreted as a service that should be assured for every member of communities that desire such services. The question now arises of the assessment of the potential of digital ecosystems to remove the identified barriers and enable effective accessible tourism experience co-creation. While it is clear that technology cannot solve all the problems, we contend that it represents a valuable engine for such effective co-creation. As noted by Akaka and Vargo (2014), technology should be conceived as an operant resource able to bring about changes in ecosystems and influence value co-creation processes. The provision of a platform to support the engagement of actors involved in accessible tourism can thus represent a first step to first removing informational and relational barriers, and over time, smoothening other barriers (e.g. cultural barriers). Thus, technology can enable the emergence of a digital ecosystem with tourists and their needs as the focal actors (Gretzel et al., 2015, 2016). Such an ecosystem could initially organise and coordinate suitable solutions to emerging PwD needs and issues by collecting and sharing the information concerning all the actors of the ecosystem. Given that tourism is a service provided by a specific territory, the digital ecosystem should be led by the authorities in charge at the territorial level, whether a municipality, province, region or country. Given that the emerging ecosystems require rapid efficiency and effectiveness checks, it seems more appropriate that the process begins at the local territorial level and then extended (through imitation and adaptations) to higher levels. Beyond authorities in charge at the territorial level, universities and other research institutes should play a central role in the design of a tourism ecosystem. These institutions should establish a dialogue with tourists, with PwD and with disability organisations and associations, without overlooking local inhabitants who are important for creating a warm and smooth welcoming. The emergence of the tourism ecosystem also draws on the constructive contributions of all the organisations representing the service providers who play a role in co-creating tourism experiences. The digital ecosystem should also be based on a series of incentives for firms that decide to be a part of the ecosystem, beyond a process of certification and evaluation of their delivered quality. As a good starting point, municipalities could establish tourism departments that have the additional responsibility for the removal of mobility barriers. The viability of this choice is demonstrated by the experience of Verona, the first (and currently the only) municipality in Italy that has introduced such a department. For smaller municipalities, the digital ecosystem could be created at a higher level, such as in a consortium of municipalities, a province or a region. Figure 2 presents the main features of the tourism digital ecosystem. Overall, the establishment of a digital ecosystem aims to make the territory an inclusive, warm and welcoming location where people want to live or stay. Hence, by providing an engagement platform, technology can act as an operant resource, disrupting the myopia guiding each actor's individual behaviours. An example of a digital ecosystem to support accessible tourism is the one being implemented by Explora, the destination management organisation of the Lombardy region (Italy). Explora has begun to establish a digital ecosystem (Ecosistema Digitale Turistico della Lombardia) through a platform that aims to support information sharing amongst the actors of Lombardy's tourism ecosystem. This ecosystem has not been created specifically to support accessible tourism. However, through this platform, operators could coordinate and harmonise the design of accessible tourism experiences, which would then be communicated and sold through the related web portal \u201cin-lombardia.it\u201d. This web portal currently hosts dozens of accessible tourism experiences; however, these are not conceived following the concept of the holistic ecosystem described in this paper. Nonetheless, the technological infrastructure that has been created has the ability to foster the future emergence of such a holistic accessible tourism ecosystem."}, {"title": "Accessible tourism futures: the world we dream to live in and the opportunities we hope to have", "article": "The paper\u2019s examination of the concepts and global policy considerations provides a strong academic and practitioner foundation for considering accessible tourism futures.

The special issue explores theoretical approaches, foundations and issues in the study of accessible tourism from a futures perspective. Accessible tourism, as with any area of academic study is an evolving field of academic research and industry practice, set within a dynamic social context. The field is interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary, and is influenced by geography, ageing and disability studies, economics, public policy, psychology, law, architecture, construction sciences, technology and marketing. Past research has attempted to view, explain and unpack the inherent complexities (Darcy, 2010) within accessible tourism through a variety of lenses, including human rights, critical tourism, embodiment, customer segmentation and universal design (UD), to name a few (see Buhalis and Darcy, 2011; Buhalis et al., 2012). The special issue is timely given the operationalisation of the United Nations (2006) Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities by 160 countries. Central to the convention is the right for tourists with disability to access transport and built environment in Article 9 and tourism experiences, goods and services within Article 30. It is therefore pertinent to look at the future of accessible tourism and contemplate a number of issues including (but not limited to) the role of technology in reshaping disability; if and how policy makers and planners are addressing the impact of accessible tourism in a sustainable manner; the political influence of people with disabilities, who make up the largest minority group in the USA, on the future of tourism; the science fiction of exoskeletons and gene therapy as a new form of adventure tourist; and the future state of embodied identity and accessible tourism. The special issue provides the opportunity for contributors to take part in the current discourses on accessible tourism from a futures perspective, in order that we can understand, manage and contribute to the development of accessible tourism in the context of economically, socially and environmentally sustainable communities. Specific topics included conceptual and research papers, viewpoints and trend papers, both qualitative and quantitative, discussing topics relating to the future of accessible tourism. Papers include a range of issues including: inclusive destinations; accessible tourism in Development Planning (toward the UN Sustainable Development Goals 2030); policy-making for accessible tourism; embodiment; representation; law and legislation; architecture and universal design; inclusion/exclusion from experiences; markets and needs analysis; accessible transport; accessible events; accessibility and culture/heritage; accessible accommodation; education/training; and technology and applications. In contrast to the past 30 years, where disability and tourism research has been largely concerned with overcoming barriers that exclude certain people (see Smith, 1987), we can discern the contours of new movements in accessible tourism, whereby overarching principles and standards of sustainability, social responsibility and customer service. The delivery of equitable tourism experiences demand the attention of sector actors and stakeholders. Accessible tourism, in this context, should be seen in the future as much more than a range of supports to excluded target groups, becoming a set of ground rules and codes of practice which contribute to the development of all tourism offers and destinations in an inclusive way. If we should gaze into the crystal ball for a moment, we could envisage that tourism will not be defined primarily in terms of different target groups, since principles of responsibility, sustainability and accessibility will in the future inform the quality criteria to which all destinations should comply and be judged as part of destination competitiveness in increasingly global context. Customers will become more aware of their individual rights and also the need to protect and sustain communities and the natural environment, influencing tourism service providers to follow generally accepted rules of service quality, genuine interactivity and engagement with the local culture, people and resources. The capability of tourism providers to recognise those rights for all (e.g. of tourists with disabilities, Design for All, responsible behaviour, inclusion of the local communities in a transparent system of remuneration and participation, working opportunities for socially excluded group etc.) is going to be the threshold, which determines whether their offers will succeed or fail in the future. The tourism sector will increasingly be seen as having transformational power as \u201ca shaper of society\u201d, acting as a promoter of jobs and economic growth, a participant in regional and community planning and a partner in global development programmes. In addition, tourism should be developed as industry that promotes understanding, inclusion and well-being for all in an equitable way. Businesses, destinations and networks, that are already active in the field of accessible tourism and/or representing markets with different specific requirements will participate more widely in the mainstream, bringing their expertise and knowledge to bear on all those issues that are still seen as \u201cdifferent types of tourism\u201d. In the development of accessible destinations and experiences, the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (2015) will be playing an increasingly supportive role, especially through its Global Code for Ethics in Tourism and the recently published Manuals on Accessible Tourism (2015), produced by ONCE Foundation and the European Network for Accessible Tourism (2015b). Before discussing the papers that have been selected for publication we would like to set the scene by examining some major conceptual and policy development areas that we believe will have a significant influence on accessible tourism futures in the future. These include: dreams and aspirations of people with disability; demography; UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; destination competitiveness frameworks; UD; and the newly adopted UN Sustainable Development Goals for 2030. Each of these areas of influence will now be outlined prior to the papers for the special edition being summarised for their contribution to the future of accessible tourism.\nDefining and conceptualising accessible tourism Conceptualising accessible tourism to reflect all its dimensions and multidisciplinarity is critical for the future. The study of tourism and disability has been a reasonably recent phenomenon with the first detailed examination emerging from the leisure constraints literature (Smith, 1987). From this beginning, a great deal of individual studies are emerged that documented significant issues with demand, supply and coordination of travel for people with disability. More recently the field has started to mature with a conceptualisation that has sought to make sense out of the individual studies and provide an overall framework for understanding the phenomena. To assist with this conceptualisation, Buhalis and Darcy (2011) offer the following definition: Accessible tourism is a form of tourism that involves collaborative processes between stakeholders that enables people with access requirements, including mobility, vision, hearing and cognitive dimensions of access, to function independently and with equity and dignity through the delivery of universally designed tourism products, services and environments. This definition adopts a whole of life approach where people through their lifespan benefit from accessible tourism provision. These include people with permanent and temporary disabilities, seniors, obese, families with young children and those working in safer and more socially sustainably designed environments (adapted from Darcy and Dickson, 2009, p. 34 in Buhalis and Darcy, 2011, pp. 10-11). Importantly the definition recognises collaboration between stakeholders across demand, supply and coordination to recognise that disability is a complex construct involving mobility, vision, hearing, cognitive and other embodiments. The definition recognises that developing inclusive destinations and accessible tourism experiences also benefit other groups in the community. Hence, it contributes toward a greater social sustainability of the industry by including and, hence, providing for a much broader cross-section of consumers that has previously been considered by the industry. In understanding the importance of individuals with disability, the stakeholders they engage with and the influence of UD on the products, services and environments they wish to seek enabling experiences. Buhalis and Darcy (2011) suggests that to develop accessible tourism futures destination managers must strategically plan through the lens of UD. Figure 1 outlines the cyclical strategic approach to engaging UD approaches across disability and lifespan considerations as a foundation for developing future accessible destination experiences.\nDreams and aspirations of people with disability The dreams and aspirations of individuals play a fundamental role in shaping the choices, which lead them to travel. Among people who live with a disability, the idea of leaving behind one\u2019s everyday surroundings and going on a journey can create significant anxiety (Darcy, 1998). People with disability often can design or influence their everyday environment whilst they have routines to negotiate any difficulties and thresholds that exist. This does not apply to new environments whilst travelling, where they do not have prior knowledge, networks or influence on the design nor the potential barriers that are to face and the way to overcome them. Indeed, a recent European survey (GfK, 2015) suggests that up to half of people with disability do not travel on holiday, due to a combination of lack of reliable information, lack of funds and previous bad experiences. Yet, the desire to travel remains with studies showing that it is not a person\u2019s impairment that impedes their travel but a series of interpersonal, attitudinal structural constraints (Daniels et al., 2005; Darcy, 2003). In recognising that a person's impairment does not constrain their travel motivations, the boundaries to what is regarded as accessible tourism destinations and experiences are continually pushed by the accessible explorers who forge new pathways for others to follow.\nMillennium development goals (MDGs) and the UN global compact At the Millennium Summit in September 2000 the largest gathering of world leaders in history adopted the UN Millennium Declaration, committing their nations to a global partnership to reduce extreme poverty and setting a series of targets, with a deadline of 2015. These targets, known as the MDGs are a set of eight specific goals set by the 191 United Nations member countries that have the goal of halving world poverty by the year 2015: Eradicating extreme poverty continues to be one of the main challenges of our time, and is a major concern of the international community. Ending this scourge will require the combined efforts of all, governments, civil society organizations and the private sector, in the context of a stronger and more effective global partnership for development. The Millennium Development Goals set timebound targets, by which progress in reducing income poverty, hunger, disease, lack of adequate shelter and exclusion \u2013 while promoting gender equality, health, education and environmental sustainability \u2013 can be measured. They also embody basic human rights \u2013 the rights of each person on the planet to health, education, shelter and security. The Goals are ambitious but feasible and, together with the comprehensive United Nations development agenda, set the course for the world\u2019s efforts to alleviate extreme poverty by 2015 (United Nations Secretary-General BAN Ki-moon). The aim of the MDGs is to encourage development by improving social and economic conditions in the world\u2019s poorest countries. Since the MDG\u2019s were agreed to significant progress has been made. To date average overall incomes have increased by approximately 21 per cent. The number of people living in extreme poverty declined by an estimated 130 million. Chile mortality rates fell from 103 deaths per 1,000 live births a year to 88. Life expectancy rose from 63 years to 65 years. An additional 8 per cent of the developing world\u2019s people received access to clean water and an additional 15 per cent acquired access to improved sanitation services. In 2015 the UN countries will adopt a new sustainable development agenda and a new global agreement on climate change. The actions taken in 2015 are expected to result in new sustainable development goals that build on the eight MDG\u2019s (United Nations, 2015). Tourism has long been seen as having significant potential to help achieve the MDG\u2019s in developing countries. For example in 1990 developing countries had 18 per cent of international tourism receipts. By 2005 this had risen to 30 per cent and to date it continues to rise. There has been significant promotion of the direct economic links between tourists and the poor. Tourism may provide employment opportunities for marginalised groups, may bring direct income to individual communities and may promote equality in developing countries (Saarinen and Rogerson, 2013).\nUD supports destination competitiveness The tourism industry needs to design and deliver offerings and services that are suitable to all potential users and remove any physical or organisational barriers that can prevent visitation. UD incorporates the accessibility requirements of people with the widest possible range of abilities, so that the greatest number of people can use mainstream products and services without the need for adaptations or special interfaces. Additionally, mainstream products and services should use interface standards which match those of technical aids, so allowing disabled people to access and use mainstream equipment. UD has been defined as: Universal design is the design of products and environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design. The intent of the universal design concept is to simplify life for everyone by making products, communications, and the built environment more usable by more people at little or no extra cost. The universal design concept targets all people of all ages, sizes and abilities\u2019. The Universal Design approach goes beyond traditional design, which tends to focus on the \u2018average\u2019 user. Universal Design is a design approach, reflecting a way of understanding people\u2019s needs. It is not a list of particular solutions, measurements, or products \u2013 Universal Design is the way to reach the solution, contributing to social inclusion (cited in Center for Universal Design, 2009; and first articulated by Mace, 1985). Applying the principles of UD can be seen as a way of developing tourism environments, transportation, services and offers, underpinning sustainable communities and businesses. Today, according to a recent study by European Network for Accessible Tourism (2015a) and partners, less than 10 per cent of tourism suppliers in Europe offer \u201caccessible\u201d tourism services, while demand for such services is set to increase due to the ageing population and continuing upward trend in market demand. Adopting UD enlarges the target markets of destinations as well as ensures that more pleasant experiences can be delivered. Therefore it can increase the market base, reduce seasonality and support the competitiveness of destinations (Buhalis, 2000). Yet, few studies have examined accessible tourism in relation to destination management and only recently has accessible tourism been examined from destination competitiveness perspective (Dom\u00ednguez Vila et al., 2015).\nPapers in this issue To address these concepts and developments this special issue is bringing a range of papers together that discuss research on many accessibility tourism aspects. Naniopoulos and Tsalis (2015) discuss a methodology for addressing the accessibility of monuments. They focus on heritage attraction sites, highlighting the challenges with archaeological sites where interventions become problematic or even impossible. In doing so, they approached accessibility as a dual notion; accessibility of an area and its potential for independent physical access and movement around the monuments as well as perceived accessibility in terms of interpreting, understanding and learning from the environment. The methodology was applied to a number of byzantine monuments as part of a cultural route in the city of Thessaloniki in Greece, as case studies. Results provide both tools for assessing monument accessibility (process orientations and checklists) and insights into the needs of travellers with disabilities for more \u201cusable\u201d heritage attractions. Concluding remarks place a focus on the prerequisites of training and cooperation to allow for the future of accessible monuments to be realised. Tsalis et al. (2015) provide an interesting study on the challenges of implementing accessibility solutions, also within the context of protection, conservation, and management of historical centres and monuments. Viewed from a tourism perspective, archaeological sites and monuments are location bound and exist only in their original place. Hence, access to such sites enables unique and authentic tourism experiences. Discourses on objective, constructive and existential authenticity are of paramount importance when accessibility is concerned. This study provides relevant examples of accessibility interventions on six monuments as well as considerations on the design of the tools that assisted site interpretation and interconnection in a cultural route. Results demonstrate how accessibility improvements can occur while respecting the history, architecture and character of the monuments. The study concludes by emphasizing that it is primarily through providing greater access, that the \u201csocialisation\u201d of these monuments will propagate authentic tourism experiences in the future. Bowtell (2015) offers an examination of the market value and attractiveness of accessible tourism in Europe. Historic data were used to provide a forecast for 2025, while primary data obtained from travel and leisure companies provided insights into managerial perceptions. Findings show a very promising potential for accessible tourism market with significant projected revenues. However, a number of challenges including lack of awareness, cost of investments, complexity of customers\u2019 needs and legal inconsistencies within the EU, create barriers toward developing comprehensive solutions for accessible tourism. Authors provide recommendations on bridging demand and supply. Gillovic and McIntosh (2015) present an interesting study on stakeholder perspectives of the future of accessible tourism in New Zealand. The study provides insights into the current situation and the future propensity for an accessible tourism industry in New Zealand. A number of interviews with key stakeholders revealed that there is a need to develop a culture of accessibility that is perceived as the norm. Findings also include the business and demand arguments, but additionally highlighted the \u201cineptness\u201d of upper industry levels to recognize the opportunity of accessible tourism, exhibiting apathy and complacency instead. Authors conclude with recommendations for the future of accessible tourism in New Zealand which can easily be generalised for other regions. Zajadacz (2015) discusses the evolution of models of disability as a basis for the future development of accessible tourism. A review of medical, social, biopsychosocial, geographical and economic models of disability reveals the theoretical underpinnings and assumptions entailed in those. These are then linked to tourism, demonstrating that different models influence the tourism provision in terms of both products and services. Authors highlight the understanding of disability under different models toward diverse tourism experiences. Several suggestions are offered on the complementary of the models and the implications on the transformation of the accessible tourism industry in the future. Cruces Portales (2015) uses a scenario planning approach to envisage alternative futures for accessible tourism. With a timeframe leading to 2050, four alternative futures are unravelled through storytelling. The scenarios are built on a matrix that includes the opposing forces of empathy \u2013 apathy, and fear of loss and certainty of benefits. The resulting, aptly named scenarios (Eden Gardens, Golden Bridge, Wasted Future and State of Hope) showcase different behaviours, schedules of changes and insights. Authors conclude with strategic ideas and proposals for the future of accessible tourism.\nConclusion When exploring the future of tourism in this area two opposing trends can be observed: future societies are predicted to become more similar, more homogenous as a consequence of consumerism, globalisation and converging urban lifestyles. However, the accessible tourism market is characteristically diverse, with complex needs and the range of dreams and ambitions is boundless. Will future global travellers be able to access more varied and personal services or will increasing numbers of travellers give rise to greater standardization of services? Accessible tourism as an emerging field of study will influence tourism destination competitiveness in the future, whether that be from a human rights, emerging market segment or service delivery perspective. In this conceptual examination, we have presented implications of number of theoretical constructs and lenses through which accessible tourism will be influenced in the future. In this special issue, a number of future dimensions are explored that demonstrate how the field has moved from an examination of the intersection of disability and tourism, to one that is clearly defined through conceptual and definitional approaches as accessible tourism. There is a common thread amongst all the papers presented in this special issue. They focus around stakeholder collaboration, as a foundation for the future development of accessible tourism. It has been explicitly suggested that raising awareness amongst stakeholders is essential to overcome barriers inhibiting the application of solutions that enhance access. The importance of stakeholder collaboration across the accessible tourism value chain has been emphasized in a number of ways in this special issue. Improving accessibility of facilities, transportation, attractions and destinations more generally, demands the collaboration of a wide range of stakeholders including architects, designers, economists, local councils, policy makers, travellers with disabilities, historians and archaeologists to name a few. Therefore \u201csocialising\u201d tourism means that access can be granted only when a number of relevant stakeholders are in accord, work together and specifically developed strategies to target the accessible tourism market. Stakeholder collaboration is a key factor for developing accessible tourism solutions, recognising the value of the market and capitalising on it. Hence, a collaborative approach is required to recognise the complementary nature of the different paradigms; to re-shape and transform the future of the accessible tourism through influencing the tourism industry, contributing government organisations and the not-for-profit sectors. The strength and depth of stakeholder collaborations will determine alternative future realities; from a future where all cooperate and share benefits for all parties, to a fatalistic picture where each stakeholder is sailing alone because they consider their interests incompatible, and everything in between. UD should provide a better accessible tourism future that should enhance the competitiveness of tourism destinations and organisations."}, {"title": "Tourism Accessibility for Impaired", "article": "\u201cI have a wife and three children. If I can\u2019t use a product or service, then the business loses not only one person\u2019s business, but five.\u201d\nAs seen in the above quote, Martin Heng emphasizes that people with disabilities and people with different access needs do travel, and are likely to travel with others. And these travelers represent, according to the Amadeus Accessibility Study, a \"$70 billion market\" just in Europe and the USA.\nThis fact alone would make a strong business case for investing time, effort, and resources needed to become more accessible and inclusive as a business and as an industry. But beyond the economic imperative, there are important reasons for the tourism industry to take this segment seriously.\nBelow are some ideas and insights on how and why we should promote not just accessibility, but also inclusive tourism that benefits everyone as well as relevant industry resources for tourism businesses and destinations seeking to better understand accessible and inclusive tourism, and to improve their practices. Parts of the content featured here have been inspired by and based on Martin's presentation (originally recorded on July 18th, 2019 as part of the GSTC Sustainable Tourism Training Online Course).\nTourism for All: Including As Many Different Groups As Possible\nContrary to what many might think, accessible tourism is not just about providing facilities that are wheel-chair accessible.\nSenior travelers. Parents traveling with small kids. Travelers with allergies and other medical conditions. These are all different types of travelers who have different degrees of accessibility restrictions and mobility requirements.\nAnd a large proportion of travelers with disabilities have \"invisible\" impairments (such as cognitive or mental health conditions and long-term illnesses) that may not be, unlike wheelchair users, immediately obvious just by looking at them.\nWhen planning for and communicating about the accessibility features and services you provide, therefore, rather than simply using the \"handicap symbol\" (the ubiquitously used sign of a wheelchair user - the top-left pictogram on the above image), these various areas of accessibility needs must be considered and appropriately indicated.\nShare on your website and brochures, for example, if you provide assistive listening devices on your tour, or if sign language interpretation is available within any of the attractions you visit.\n\"Tourism for All\" is a concept that is addressing a growing segment of travelers with a diverse range of needs and requirements. What is \"accessible\" to one traveler who is a wheelchair user, for example, may be very difficult to access or completely inaccessible to another traveler with a different type of disability, mobility impairment or other conditions.\nThat's why becoming more inclusive is a more appropriate goal for the tourism industry than focusing just on \"accessible tourism\" (which can be vague and hard to define - accessible for whom?).\nAn inclusive tourism business or destination works to offer positive travel experiences to people with different needs by addressing them from various perspectives, and by providing design and service solutions that aim to cover as many different groups as possible.\nUniversal Design: Designing for Everyone, Being a Good Host\nWhen it comes to being inclusive and promoting Tourism for All, a key concept that underlies the solutions to be implement by tourism businesses and destinations is Universal Design.\nThe definition of Universal Design is as follows:\nUniversal Design is the design and composition of an environment so that it can be accessed, understood and used to the greatest extent possible by all people regardless of their age, size, ability or disability. An environment (or any building, product, or service in that environment) should be designed to meet the needs of all people who wish to use it. This is not a special requirement, for the benefit of only a minority of the population. It is a fundamental condition of good design. If an environment is accessible, usable, convenient and a pleasure to use, everyone benefits.\n- Centre for Excellence in Universal Design, \" What is Universal Design\nTo understand where you need to improve in order to offer universally accessible experience for everyone's benefit, take some time to reflect on the whole customer journey from the perspectives of guests with different access needs and mobility requirements.\nThink about how they experience travel - from the customer finding your business, to booking their trip, to arriving in your destination, to getting around during their stay.\nAre there steps to enter the restaurant that will make it difficult for customers with limited mobility? Does your hotel offer an accessible and easy-to-follow process for guests with disabilities to check in/out and get around within the property? And is your website designed for users with different needs (e.g. individuals with hearing or vision impairment)?\nBusinesses often have barriers that make it difficult for customers with particular access or mobility impairments to enjoy a certain product or service, because of the lack of awareness that those barriers exist.\nAnd in some cases, businesses may be \"rejecting\" prospective customers without ever knowing. The 2016 Click-Away Pound study found that \"71% of customers with access needs will click away from a website that they find difficult to use\".\nWith all the different types of accessibility requirements, it may seem difficult or impossible to anticipate and accommodate the various needs of your customers. But it's important to remember that in tourism we are in the business of providing services to welcome guests; and that it is in fact your responsibility as a host to cater to the needs of your guests and to make them feel welcome.\nIt's part of being a good host.\nBy considering the diverse needs and abilities of all throughout the design process, universal design creates products, services and environments that meet peoples' needs. Simply put, universal design is good design. - Centre for Excellence in Universal Design, \"What is Universal Design\"\nInclusive Growth and Sustainable Development\nWith the growing importance of the accessible tourism market, and especially the spending power of this market segment including the \"multiplier effect\" (each traveler with impairment is likely to influence the purchase decisions of multiple members of their party), there is a strong economic imperative to be considered. To remain competitive, your tourism business and destination should be investing in universal design and inclusive solutions.\nBeyond the economic imperative, however, there are also key reasons why inclustive tourism should be part of the global sustainable tourism agenda.\nWith an estimated 15% of the world population living with some forms of disabilities (World Health Organization, World Report on Disability 2011), and the changing demographic of the \"rapidly ageing\" populations around the world (WHO, Aging and Life Course), sustainable development can only be achieved through an inclusive approach to creating solutions and opportunities.\nThe United Nations' \"Disability and Development Report: Realizing the Sustainable Development Goals by, for and with persons with disabilities\" (2018) recognizes that \"striving to achieve disability-inclusive development is not only the right thing to do, it is also the practical thing to do,\" as \"the success of the 2030 Agenda requires a participatory and inclusive approach in which all stakeholders, including persons with disabilities, are engaged.\"\nAnd that's why Tourism for All is highlighted in the Global Sustainable Tourism Criteria, the baseline standard for sustainability in travel and tourism.\nSource: Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC)\nAnd in the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO)'s Global Code of Ethics for Tourism.\nSource: UNWTO, Global Code of Ethics for Tourism\nInclusion in the Work Place\nHaving understood the importance of striving for universal design and working towards becoming more inclusive, what can tourism businesses do to get started? What are some of the first steps?\nOne of the key challenges when considering steps to becoming more inclusive is to understand the diverse needs of your customers and your prospective customers. The barriers that prevent some people from having a positive travel experience - whether they may be steps that cannot be climbed, signs that cannot be read, or buttons that cannot be reached - are hard to notice unless you put yourself in the position of those with particular disabilities and impairments.\nOne of the most effective ways for businesses to understand the various accessibility needs of their customers is to have team members who know and represent the perspectives of those customers. In short, hire people with disabilities. Empower them to help make your business more inclusive, both within your operations and through your products and services.\nThe UNWTO report \"Recommendations on Accessible Tourism\" (2013) states that \"the staff of tourism establishments and related services should be prepared to know, understand and address the needs of customers with disabilities\", and \"the staff should include employees who know how to communicate with persons with sensory disabilities.\"\n\"The hospitality industry serves travellers from all over the world. The diversity of cultures implies a diversity of customer expectations as well. The hotels with a diverse workforce to cater to such a wide customer base hold a strong competitive advantage over others. ... [To] have employees that understand the needs and requirements of the customers and provide key insights into making properties progressively accessible is also a crucial element of the overall business strategy.\" - Hospitality Workers Training Centre, \"Disability Inclusion in the Hospitality Industry Makes Business Sense\"\nBusiness Examples: Staff Diversity and Inclusion\nLemon Tree Hotels Limited, India\nWinner of the 2019 Tourism for Tomorrow Awards, in the category \"Investing in People\", Lemon Tree Hotels have focused on creating a socially inclusive work environment, bringing together people of different backgrounds, abilities and ethnicities to work as a unified team with a common goal.

Experiencing a voyage on Tenacious (or her sister ship Lord Nelson) is an object lesson in the benefits of inclusion and accessibility. People living with a disability can challenge themselves, experience adventure and explore what they are capable of given the opportunity, while able-bodied crew members are shown that disability doesn\u2019t necessarily mean incapacity.\" - Martin Heng, \"Setting sail for accessible adventure on the SV Tenacious\" (Lonely Planet)\nThis amazing example of SV Tenacious is a good reason for all of us in the tourism industry to be asking, as Martin challenges us, \"If they can do this, what excuse do we have not to make mainstream tourism operations more accessible?\"\nSo a better question here, instead of \u201cHow can tourism become more inclusive?\u201d, may be, \u201cwhat are we not (yet) doing to make tourism more inclusive, and how are we going to push for change?\""}, {"title": "Universal Design Guide for Inclusive Tourism by Scott and Sarah Pruett", "article": "\u201cInclusive tourism is a global movement to ensure the full social participation of all persons with disabilities in travel, citizenships, and cultural contribution \u2013 and in the process, to ensure the same for everyone else.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Scott Rains , srains@oco.net www.RollingRains.com For more on the Pruetts see: Universal Design Partners https://universaldesign.org/"}, {"title": "UNWTO, ONCE Foundation and ENAT - Delivering Accessible Tourism for All", "article": "UNWTO, ONCE Foundation and ENAT - Delivering Accessible Tourism for All\nThe World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) will continue to build on its successful partnership with the Spanish ONCE Foundation and the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT). The three parties have agreed to extend their partnership agreement for a further four years to ensure that their work to improve accessibility, in every part of the tourism value chain, continues during and beyond the pandemic.\nThe joint work will continue to focus on the promotion of good practices during the current crisis, the application of standards, the measurement of accessible tourism, as well as labour inclusion and institutional disability inclusive policies. The three partners are currently collecting success stories of destinations and companies which have adopted new sanitary protocols to facilitate access to travel and tourism for all, including both residents and visitors. In line with the key UNWTO Recommendations released early on during the pandemic, the Accessibility Champions initiative is still open for submissions illustrating how the guidelines to restart tourism without imposing new obstacles are being successfully implemented. The most outstanding cases will be promoted by the partners through an e-publication and webinars.\nThe three partners are also committed to raising awareness of the forthcoming ISO Standard on Tourism for All. All three have worked with the International Standardization Organization (ISO) on the new requirements and recommendations. The ISO standard will represent a milestone, being the first global standard aimed at implementing and improving accessibility throughout the tourism value chain.\nThe awareness-raising work will sensitize institutions, governments and service providers o the importance of accessibility for all and inclusion. It will make clear that this is not only a question of human rights and equal opportunities, but also a major competitive advantage for destinations and the private sector.\nUNWTO, the ONCE Foundation and ENAT jointly state: \u201cAccessibility for all is about service quality, innovation and comfort for all tourists, new sources of revenue and new clients with disabilities, seniors and families with young children, among many other individuals, with specific access requirements. By adopting Universal Design principles in the development of environments and services, the tourism sector can fulfil its moral responsibility and, in many countries, legal obligations to cater to those with specific requirements, making tourism for all a reality.\u201d\nRelated Links"}, {"title": "The World's Best Accessible Hotels", "article": "1\nIt starts with a booking\nIt starts with a booking\nThe only way to leave a review is to first make a booking.

It is about enabling everyone to enjoy the freedom that air travel offers. Approximately one in five people in the United States, or 64 million, have a disability and more than 10% of the population in the EU suffer from reduced mobility \u2013 mainly the disabled and the elderly.\nThe world\u2019s population is aging as virtually every country in the world is experiencing growth in the number and proportion of older persons in their population. As a result, IATA and its member airlines are committed to ensuring that all passengers can enjoy the freedom offered by air travel, no matter their abilities or limitations. This is not only the right thing to do for our passengers, it is also good for business. Passengers with disabilities will represent a growing segment. For instance, the total number of wheelchair requests in 2017 was approximately 15 million, a 30% increase on 2016.\nWhy is providing better access to individuals with disabilities important for the air transport industry?\nSafe and dignified travel for all passengers, including those with disabilities, is an airline commitment in addition, for the air transport industry it's not just because it is \"the right thing to do\" it also makes business sense.\nIATA member airlines have an inherent motivation to ensure that all people with accessibility needs have a positive experience when traveling by air. These people are customers-and are a growing segment of the population. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that more than one billion people live with some form of disability, which constitutes approximately 15% of the world's population.\nAirlines commit to improve travel for passengers with disabilities\nTherefore in 2019, the IATA Annual General Meeting (AGM) unanimously adopted a landmark industry resolution which re-affirmed the commitment of IATA member airlines to provide safe, reliable and dignified travel for people with disabilities. At the center of IATA's developement of its guiding principles and all its work on accessibility since, is the disability community's own guiding principle of \"Nothing For Us, Without Us.\" At every stage of the development of airline accessibility policy and operating standards, the disability community is involved and listened to. This is of course the only way to keep the focus on disability, accessibility and inclusion-particularly when facing a new reality and new measures due to a pandemic.\nChanging the focus from disability to accessibility and inclusion is allowing the travel sector to bring together passengers with disabilities and governments. Harmonizing regulations and processes and providing the clarity and global consistency that passengers expect.\nInterview with Linda Ristagno, IATA's AD External Affairs on Air Transport Accessibility\nAirlines launch global action group to improve handling of disability mobility aids\nIn July 2021, IATA announced the launch of a global Mobility Aids Action Group to examine and improve the transport journey of mobility aids, including wheelchairs, with the objective of improving the handling of this vital equipment for travelers with disabilities.\nThe Action Group is the first of its kind aimed at tackling issues around the safe and secure transport of mobility aids\u2014an issue of huge importance to a growing number of travelers. It also provides advice and recommendations to airlines and other stakeholders concerning the establishment of policy, process and standards related to the handling and transport of mobility aids.\nUniquely, the Mobility Aids Action Group involves the full range of stakeholders impacted by this issue, including accessibility organizations (representing travelers with disabilities), airlines, ground service providers, airports and mobility aids manufacturers. It is the first time a mobility aids manufacturer will be invited to participate in an IATA task force. \u201cAs airlines are just one link in the chain in the handling of mobility aids, it is essential we bring all players together to develop solutions. What\u2019s more, we are excited to invite a mobility aids manufacturer to the table. We think this is critical so all stakeholders can work together to take steps to improve the transport journey of mobility aids,\u201d said Willie Walsh, Director General of IATA.\nWheelchair damage or loss during air transportation\nWhile the industry has had standards for persons traveling with disabilities for some time there are still gaps. Damage to mobility aids has been an area that has been identified as a key topic to address from the disability community.\nAirlines have made efforts to improve, but damage or loss is still occurring. And when it does, it is highly distressing to the passenger as these devices are more than equipment\u2014they are extensions of their body and essential to their independence.\nTravelers with mobility aids face risks to their health and safety if their wheelchair or mobility equipment is lost, damaged or destroyed, as replacements are not always provided, and if provided, are not always suitable for the person\u2019s needs.\nThe loss or damage of wheelchairs or other mobility equipment takes away the independence of the traveler and affects every aspect of their daily lives until the matter is resolved appropriately.\nA recent survey from Able Move identified that among those who actively continue to fly, 55% say the biggest single cause of concern when flying was the fear of their wheelchair being damaged or lost.\n\u201cEvery year, thousands of wheelchairs are transported safely by air. However, damage or loss is still occurring. And when it does, it is devastating to the passenger as these devices are more than equipment\u2014they are extensions of their body and essential to their independence. We acknowledge that we are not where we want to be on this as an industry. This is why we want to do something about it on a global level, not through setting up a talking shop, but by bringing the key groups together to take practical action,\u201d said Willie Walsh, Director General of IATA.\nImproved access for passengers with disabilities in the industry restart\nAs airlines rebuild, the industry is eager to build a more inclusive restart. Despite the COVID-19 crisis, the IATA and its member airlines have worked with the accessibility community to move the priority of accessible air travel forward through a number of efforts. These are includeded in the latest Airport Handling Manual (AHM).\nWhat to consider for passengers' with disabilities air travel journey\nTo the extent possible, airline and other stakeholders should strive to ensure that passengers with disabilities maintain their independence and dignity. This is accomplished through adequate airport infrastructure, appropriate training, timely and customer-oriented services, as well as making use of technological solutions that can be leveraged to provided passengers with disabilities with choice and freedom to travel on their own terms. You can find detailed guidelines which can help your operations in section 176 of the AHM.\nPre-Travel: Passenger information, booking and ticketing\nCommunicating assistance needs in advance of travel is recommended and, in some cases, required to fulfill specialized requests. This allows airlines, airports and third-party service providers to be better prepared to assist passengers with disabilities throughout their travel itinerary, making the journey easier and the travel experience more seamless and enjoyable.\nAt the airport\nThe sole responsibility to provide assistance to passengers with disabilities throughout the airport is not limited to the airlines; depending on national regulations, airports may be responsible for providing assistance to passengers with disabilities directly, or via third-party service providers.\nAs not all passenger processes at an airport fall under the airlines\u2019 responsibility (i.e. security screening, exit immigration, customs, etc.) airlines need to work collaboratively with airports, regulators and other stakeholders in order to provide a safe and satisfying travel experience to all passengers.\nCheck-in\nAll available check-in methods such as via airline websites, mobile apps, self-service kiosks should be accessible to passengers with disabilities. In addition, airline agents involved in the check-in process should be trained to ensure that adequate assistance is provided. Passengers with disabilities should also always be offered assistance with carry-on and checked baggage.\nMobility device handling\nThe safe transport of a passenger\u2019s with disability personal mobility device is a critical operation for any airline as the wheelchair or scooter is an extension of the passenger and should be treated as such. Other mobility aids such as walkers and canes provide passengers struggling with mobility much-needed stability and support to safely walk and should also be handled with great care. As general guidance, the transportation of passenger battery-powered devices must be compliant with DGR subsection 2.3.\nBoarding and disembarking\nBoarding the aircraft can be a stressful experience for passengers with disabilities. Airlines should ensure that any requests made in advance are properly noted and any last-minute requests are handled efficiently and with care. Assistance must be provided as necessary, in addition airlines and airports should coordinate to make available at all stations wheelchairs and other mobility devices for boarding/disembarking within airport facilities, before departure, during intermediate stops and on arrival. Upon arrival, airlines should make best efforts to accommodate the passengers with disabilities, procedures will vary by terminal and gate configuration in terms of boarding bridge, etc. Therefore, all staff should be properly trained to provide: adequate mobility transfer techniques and prompt delivery of mobility devices. More details can be found in the Airport Handling Manual (AHM).\nWhat are the benefits of following the IATA guidance found in the AHM?\nPutting into practice the IATA guidance, airlines, airports and other industry stakeholders will:\nEfficiently serve passengers with disabilities by using IATA standards and best practices\nEfficiently communicate with passengers with disabilities before and during their travel experience\nEnsure available measures are applied consistently\nIdentify good practices in passenger assistance during disruptions and irregular operations\nHow can I get the Airport Handling Manual (AHM)?\nYou can order the latest edition of the AHM here."}, {"title": "TSA Cares: What to expect when traveling with a mobility aid", "article": "Are you or someone you know traveling using a wheelchair or mobility aid?

Providing these services, in some cases, depends on the passenger fulfilling certain conditions; for example, requesting services in advance (see Advance Notice/Supporting Documentation Requesting Services for Persons with Disabilities: A Guide) or providing information/documents, such as written instructions for the disassembly and reassembly of a mobility aid (see Section 6).\nAllow passengers to keep their mobility aids as long as possible ASL version of Allow passengers to keep their mobility aids as long as possible Continue to the next video: Assist passengers who are not independently mobile Carriers are required to permit passengers to retain their mobility aids until it becomes necessary to store them. In some cases - such as when a mobility aid doesn't need to be disassembled for storage, because it is foldable, light or easy to store for example \u2014 this could mean that a passenger can remain in their mobility aid until they board at the gate. In other cases, they may have to transfer out of their mobility aid sooner (for example, at check-in) to allow enough time for the carrier to move their mobility aid through the terminal to the baggage loading area, and to then disassemble, package and load the mobility aid safely prior to departure.\nAssist passengers who are not independently mobile ASL version of Assist passengers who are not independently mobile Continue to the next video: Transport mobility aids as priority baggage If a passenger who is in a wheelchair (or any other device) in which they are not independently mobile is waiting at a terminal for departure after checking in or in order to transfer to another segment of their trip, carrier personnel must: Provide the passenger with a place to wait that is close to personnel who are available to provide assistance if needed; and\nPeriodically ask the passenger whether they need any assistance and provide that assistance.\nTransport mobility aids as priority baggage ASL version of Transport mobility aids as priority baggage Continue to the next video: Store mobility aids on board transportation equipment Carriers must transport mobility aids needed during travel as priority baggage. This may require removing other cargo or baggage from storage if necessary to make room for the storage of a mobility aid. Carriers are also required to: Disassemble and package a mobility aid if necessary to store it and to unpackage and reassemble it on arrival at the passenger's destination; and\nPromptly return the mobility aid to the passenger on arrival at their destination. Note:Mobility aid batteries may need to be removed and packaged separately to ensure they can be transported safely. Carrier personnel must ensure, as part of reassembling a mobility aid, that batteries that were removed for transport are reattached and operational before returning the aid to the passenger. Some types of batteries, particularly those labelled as lithium metal or lithium ion batteries, may be prohibited from transport due to Transportation of Dangerous Goods Regulations. Carriers can refuse to transport a mobility aid if: The weight or size of the mobility aid exceeds the capacity of boarding equipment such as lifts and ramps (applicable to aircraft, trains, ferries and buses);\nThe combined weight of a passenger who must remain in their mobility aid in order to board and the weight of the mobility aid exceeds the capacity of the boarding equipment (applicable to trains, ferries and buses);\nThe doors to baggage compartments (applicable to aircraft, trains, and buses) are too small for the mobility aid;\nThe turning radii of all cars are too small for the mobility aid (applicable to trains);\nThe size of the baggage compartments is too small for the mobility aid (applicable to aircraft and buses); or\nTransportation of the mobility aid would jeopardize aircraft airworthiness. (Note: this includes considerations which affect the safe operation of an aircraft, such as the weight of cargo and balancing this weight to maintain proper control and stability or the need to comply with Transportation of Dangerous Goods Regulations.) However, carriers that refuse to carry a mobility aid must: At the time of the refusal, tell the passenger why their mobility aid was not accepted and provide this in writing within the next 10 days; and\nLet the passenger know about alternative trips operated by the carrier to the same destination on which their mobility aid can be transported, and offer to book this for the passenger at the lesser of the fare for the original trip and the fare for the alternative trip. Example: An airline advises Ms. Smith that it cannot transport her mobility aid because the aircraft's cargo door is too small for her mobility aid. The airline, however, informs Ms. Smith that it will be operating a flight to the same destination the next day using an aircraft that can accommodate her mobility aid. The airline also informs Ms. Smith that, although the fare for the new flight is higher, she'll be charged the fare for the original flight. With Ms. Smith's agreement, the airline makes a reservation for Ms. Smith on the alternative flight. Recommended practice: Reservation agents should obtain information from a passenger on the weight and dimensions of their mobility aid and ask whether there are any parts that can be removed or collapsed for storage. Information should also be obtained on the type and number of batteries that need to be transported and passengers should be advised of any restrictions or special packaging requirements. When there's been a change in transportation equipment \u2014 especially when the replacement equipment is smaller \u2014 carriers should immediately contact passengers who are travelling with mobility aids, to reconfirm that their aids can be transported on the alternative equipment. This avoids passengers going to the terminal on the day of departure only to be told that there's been a change in equipment and their mobility aids can no longer be transported.\nStore mobility aids on board transportation equipment ASL version of Store mobility aids on board transportation equipment Continue to the next video: Take measures when a mobility aid is damaged, destroyed or lost during transport Rail and marine carriers must permit a passenger who uses a mobility aid to store it on the train or ferry. Each train must have at least one storage space and each deck of a ferry must also have one. Rail and marine carriers must store mobility aids in a manner that protects them from damage, including by using an anchoring system or by placing them in an area that is not intended for use by passengers. Airlines must make a reasonable effort to permit passengers who use walkers or manual folding wheelchairs to store them in the aircraft cabin. Similarly, bus carriers must make a reasonable effort to permit passengers who use walkers or manual folding wheelchairs to store them in the passenger section of the bus. Where this is not possible, those aids must be stored in baggage compartments. Note: A carrier's ability to store mobility aids in the cabin may depend on availability of space in the cabin. Airlines are not required to block seats or deny boarding to customers in order to accommodate a manual folding wheelchair.\nTake measures when a mobility aid is damaged, destroyed or lost during transport ASL version of Take measures when a mobility aid is damaged, destroyed or lost during transport Continue to the next video: Offer the option of a special declaration of interest for international air travel Carriers must, without delay and at their own expense, take the following measures when a mobility aid that is not retained by a passenger during transport is damaged, destroyed, lost or not returned to the passenger within the usual time frame after they arrive at their destination: Provide the passenger with a temporary replacement mobility aid that meets their needs and allow them to use it until their mobility aid is returned to them or is repaired or replaced, or until the passenger is reimbursed for the loss of the mobility aid;\nReimburse the passenger for any expenses they incurred because the mobility aid was damaged, destroyed or lost, or because it was not returned to them when they arrived at their destination;\nArrange for the repair of a mobility aid that has been damaged and promptly return it to the passenger or, if it cannot be adequately repaired: Replace the damaged aid with the same model or, if that is not available, with a model that meets the passenger's needs and has features and qualities equivalent to those of the damaged aid, or Reimburse the passenger for the full replacement cost of the aid; and\nIn the case of a destroyed mobility aid, or once a mobility aid has been declared lost (96 hours after arrival in air travel or 72 hours after arrival in rail, ferry or bus travel: Replace the destroyed or lost mobility aid with the same model or, if that is not available, with a model that meets the passenger's needs and has equivalent features and qualities as the destroyed or lost aid, or Reimburse the passenger for the full replacement cost of the aid\nNote:Carriers must ensure that any temporary or permanent replacement mobility aid meets the passenger's needs. This should be determined in discussion with the passenger and assumptions should not be made about the passenger's mobility needs. Although a carrier is obligated to replace a lost mobility aid within the specified time frame following the passenger's arrival at their destination (72 hours for bus, ferry and rail travel and 96 hours for air travel), in cases where the mobility aid is only misplaced but not permanently lost, the passenger may voluntarily accept a carrier's offer to continue using a temporary replacement mobility aid beyond this time frame until their own mobility aid can be returned to them. Passengers whose mobility aids are highly customized may prefer this alternative to being provided with a new mobility aid.\nOffer the option of a special declaration of interest for international air travel ASL version of Offer the option of a special declaration of interest for international air travel Continue to the next video: Carriers \u2014 Services for passengers travelling with other assistive devices When a person who wants to travel with their mobility aid makes a reservation with an airline for an international flight, the airline must advise them of the option to make a special declaration of interest. A special declaration of interest sets out the monetary value of the mobility aid and a description of its features in case of destruction, loss, damage or delay. The airline must permit a passenger to make a special declaration of interest at any time before the mobility aid is taken from the passenger for storage in the aircraft\u2019s baggage compartment. An airline that operates an international flight must publish a notice on its website that passengers who use mobility aids have the option to make a special declaration of interest. For domestic travel, airlines should be aware that the CTA 's Air Passenger Protection Regulations (APPR) apply the provisions of the Montreal Convention on lost, damaged and delayed baggage to domestic flights. For more information on the APPR baggage requirements, please see Baggage Requirements for Domestic Services: A Guide.\nCarriers \u2014 Services for passengers travelling with other assistive devices ASL version of Carriers \u2014 Services for passengers travelling with other assistive devices Continue to the next video: Publishing information on transporting mobility aids and other assistive devices Common assistive devices used by persons with disabilities are canes, crutches, communication devices (for example, a speech generating device which translates typed messages into digitized speech), orthotic positioning devices (used to support and position a person who has postural problems), and portable oxygen concentrators. Carriers must allow a passenger to keep a small assistive device with them on board if they need it during travel, provided the assistive device remaining with the customer does not create an onboard safety issue and is subjected to onboard safety requirements. Providing these services, in some cases, depends on the passenger fulfilling certain conditions (see Section 6). Note: Travellers with disabilities may require disability-related equipment or supplies at destination -- such as an additional mobility aid, a prosthetic limb, or food for a service dog. Refusing to accept such items, or charging travellers for their carriage, may constitute an undue obstacle to travel in the national transportation system. It is strongly recommended that carriers accept reasonable quantities of such items at no additional charge to the traveller, unless they can demonstrate that doing so would cause undue hardship (for example, the configuration of a small aircraft may not permit carriage of an additional large mobility aid). Travellers with disabilities are encouraged to provide advance notice of their request to carry disability-related items at no additional charge, and to be prepared, in some cases, to provide medical documentation to allow the carrier to assess the request. Recommendation: Carriers are subject to numerous safety rules and regulations, some of which can impact on the transportation of assistive devices. Reservation agents should obtain information from a passenger on their assistive device, including whether it uses batteries or needs an onboard power supply, and advise the passenger of any restrictions.\nPublishing information on transporting mobility aids and other assistive devices ASL version of Carriers \u2014 Publishing information on transporting mobility aids and other assistive devices Continue to the next video: Retain information and documents for future trips A notice listing their obligations concerning the transportation of mobility aids and other assistive devices (specifically, which ATPDR provisions apply); and\nprovisions apply); and The services they offer to passengers travelling with mobility aids and other assistive devices and any conditions on those services. Carriers must publish on their website the maximum weight and dimensions of mobility aids that each make and model of its transportation equipment is capable of transporting. Carriers without a website must publish information in another way that passengers can easily find, such as in a brochure. This requirement applies to all publishing obligations noted in this guide.\nRetain information and documents for future trips ASL version of Retain information and documents for future trips Continue to the next video: Terminal operators \u2014 Services for travellers who use mobility aids If a carrier requests information or documents from a person who wants to travel with a mobility aid or other assistive device, the carrier must offer to retain an electronic copy for at least three years. This avoids a person having to provide the same information or documents each time they travel with the carrier. Note: A carrier may ask a person to confirm, at the time of a new reservation, if information or documents already on file about the person's mobility aid or other assistive device have changed since they were provided to the carrier.\nTerminal operators \u2014 Services for travellers who use mobility aids ASL version of Terminal operators \u2014 Services for travellers who use mobility aids Continue to the next video: Curbside assistance Terminal operators must ensure that certain services are accessible to travellers using mobility aids or other assistive devices. Information on the applicability of these requirements to terminal operators can be found in Transportation service providers covered by the Accessible Transportation for Persons with Disabilities Regulations: A guide.\nCurbside assistance ASL version of Curbside assistance Continue to the next video: Ensure accessible ground transportation from terminals Terminal operators must provide curbside assistance to travellers using wheelchairs by assisting them with their wheelchair (or by providing one if needed): To get from the curbside zone outside to the check-in area inside or to get to a carrier representative if there is no check-in area; and\nTo get from the general public area inside to the curbside zone outside after the traveller has landed/disembarked at the terminal. Note: At some terminals, carriers choose to provide curbside assistance themselves, rather than having the terminal operator provide the service. If this is the case, terminal operators must still make sure the requirements outlined above are met. More information can be found in Curbside assistance: A guide . Publish information on curbside assistance Terminal operators must publish on their website information about the location of the curbside zone and how to request curbside assistance.\nEnsure accessible ground transportation from terminals ASL version of Ensure accessible ground transportation from terminals Continue to the next video: Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA) The ATPDR recognize that, like many travellers, those with disabilities often rely on ground transportation to be able to complete their trip. Terminal Operators that have an agreement with a service provider for the provision of ground transportation from the terminal \u2014 including by taxi, limousine, bus or rental vehicle \u2014 must ensure that the transportation is accessible to a person travelling with a mobility aid (or any other assistive device), including by using vehicles that can carry non-folding or non-collapsible mobility aids. The terminal operator must ensure that there are rental vehicles that are equipped with hand-control systems. Publish information on accessible ground transportation Terminal operators must publish on their website information about accessible ground transportation. Publish information on curbside assistance and accessible ground transportation Terminal operators must publish on their website information about the location of the curbside zone and how to request curbside assistance, and information on accessible ground transportation.\nCanadian Air Transport Security Authority ( CATSA ) ASL version of Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA) Continue to the next video: Chapter 4. Personnel training obligations CATSA must, when screening a traveller who has an assistive device (including a mobility aid): Make a reasonable effort to simultaneously screen the traveller\u2019s assistive device;\nImmediately return an assistive device that has been removed for separate screening to the traveller after it has been screened; and\nOffer a chair to a traveller whose mobility aid has been removed for separate screening, while the mobility aid is being screened. Note: The screening of travellers with mobility aids or other assistive devices may involve special procedures such as swabbing for explosive trace detection. CATSA provides useful information for travellers with disabilities about the screening process on its website, including information on planning a trip and what to expect at screening checkpoints. Travellers who use mobility aids or other assistive devices may wish to consult the CATSA website prior to travel to familiarize themselves with the screening process.\n4. Personnel training obligations ASL version of Chapter 4. Personnel training obligations Continue to the next video: Chapter 5. Obligations relating to the accessibility of transportation equipment and terminals to travellers who use a mobility aid Canadian carriers, terminal operators, the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority and the Canada Border Services Agency must ensure that their personnel who interact with the public, or participate in making decisions or developing policies and procedures that specifically affect travellers who use mobility aids or other assistive devices, receive training on: the assistive devices that are commonly used;\nthe different types of mobility aids;\nthe requirements and appropriate methods for transporting and storing mobility aids, including the disassembling, packaging, unpackaging and reassembling of mobility aids; and\nusing, or assisting a traveller with a disability in using carrier-operated equipment, including a lift, a ramp and any other level-change device. While foreign carriers operating services to and from Canada are not subject to the training requirements set out in Part 1 of the ATPDR, all carriers are encouraged to ensure that their personnel receive the same or equivalent training regarding mobility aids and assistive devices.\n5. Obligations relating to the accessibility of transportation equipment and terminals to travellers who use a mobility aid ASL version of Chapter 5. Obligations relating to the accessibility of transportation equipment and terminals to travellers who use a mobility aid Continue to the next video: Transportation equipment - Aircraft A traveller who uses a mobility aid generally wants to be able to remain in it as much as possible given its importance to their independence, dignity, safety and comfort. The Canadian Standards Association's (CSA) CAN/CSA-B651-18 Accessible design for the built environment (CSA B651-18) contains requirements for making buildings and other facilities accessible to persons with various disabilities, including those relating to a person's mobility. Many of the requirements in CSA B651-18 are based on the concept of a \"manual wheelchair\" and reflect criteria designed to permit persons using their wheelchairs, as well other assistive devices such as walkers and crutches, to access and manoeuver within a space and use the features that it contains. The ATPDR provisions applicable to transportation equipment and terminals incorporate relevant requirements in CSA B651-18. Note: Power wheelchairs and scooters generally have longer footprints than manual wheelchairs. The ATPDR provisions represent minimum requirements which carriers and terminal operators can (and sometimes, should) choose to exceed. All Canadian carriers are required to meet the technical requirements in the ATPDR found in Part 3, and terminal operators are required to meet the technical requirements found in Part 4 for terminals located in Canada. Information on the applicability of these requirements for all modes can be found in Transportation service providers covered by the Accessible Transportation for Persons with Disabilities Regulations: A guide .\nTransportation equipment\nTransportation equipment - Aircraft ASL version of Transportation equipment - Aircraft Continue to the next video: Transportation equipment - Trains Aircraft have obvious physical constraints and inherent structural limitations which mean that space is limited, such that the ATPDR requirements relate to the use of on-board wheelchairs as opposed to passenger-owned wheelchairs that may be larger or more difficult to accommodate.\nTransportation equipment - Trains ASL version of Transportation equipment - Trains Continue to the next video: Transportation equipment - Ferries Trains are required to have mobility aid spaces to enable passengers to remain in their mobility aids during travel in addition to providing on-board wheelchairs for passengers whose mobility aids are stored. Trains are required to meet requirements in CSA B651-18 to permit a passenger using a wheelchair to access, and travel between, adjacent areas which are required to be wheelchair-accessible, such as a wheelchair-accessible cabin, food service area, wheelchair-accessible washroom, and a mobility aid space. Trains must also meet CSA B651-18 requirements applicable for persons using mobility aids relating to such things as doors and operating controls.\nTransportation equipment - Ferries ASL version of Transportation equipment - Ferries Continue to the next video: Transportation equipment - Buses The ATPDR require that most areas and amenities on a ferry be accessible to passengers using mobility aids and meet applicable CSA B651-18 requirements. Ferries, relative to other transportation equipment, provide ample space for passengers who use mobility aids and, consequently, most passengers choose to remain in their mobility aid during travel. However, in recognition that some passengers prefer to store their mobility aid, the ATPDR require ferries to have on-board wheelchairs and storage for mobility aids.\nTransportation equipment - Buses ASL version of Transportation equipment - Buses Continue to the next video: Transportation equipment - Terminals Buses are required to have mobility aid spaces to enable passengers to remain in their mobility aids during travel. Alternatively, passengers can store these in baggage compartments. The ATPDR also require buses to have wheelchair-accessible washrooms where space permits and contain specifications regarding the placement of operating controls and grab bars, and handholds and stanchions to meet the needs of passengers who remain in their wheelchairs.\nTransportation equipment - Terminals ASL version of Transportation equipment - Terminals Continue to the next video: Chapter 6. Responsibilities of travellers who use a mobility aid or other assistive device Terminal operators are required to meet all of the requirements in CSA B651-18, with some exceptions, including requirements regarding bathtubs, viewing spaces in assembly areas, and residential accommodation. Terminal operators are also required to meet requirements applicable to lifts, ramps, stairs, and light-rail trains and shuttle buses operating at terminals.\n6.

Responsibilities of travellers who use a mobility aid or other assistive device Continue to the next video: Provide advance notice The ATPDR recognize that carriers are responsible for the safety of their passengers and personnel and that this can require them to establish travel conditions, including for passengers who use a mobility aid or other assistive device. There are things a person who wants to travel with their mobility aid or device can do to help avoid problems during their trip\nProvide advance notice ASL version of Provide advance notice Continue to the next video: Provide Information for the disassembly and reassembly of a mobility aid and arrive early A carrier may require a person who intends to travel with their mobility aid or other assistive device to provide it with advance notice. Generally speaking, a person with a disability will have to make a request for services at least 48 hours before their departure. They can do this by contacting the carrier directly; for example, by phone, email or through their website. Some carriers may also refer passengers to a specialized department such as a medical desk. However, if the carrier requires documents or information from a person to provide them the service, a carrier may need up to 96-hour notice before departure to assess the request. In this situation, the person will have 48 hours to provide the documents and/or information the carrier has requested. Once the person has provided this, the carrier may take up to 48 additional hours to assess the request. If the person with a disability gives advance notice but the information or documents provided are insufficient or the notice period includes a day that is a weekend day or holiday, the carrier may not be able to complete its assessment of the request. In these cases, the carrier may not be required to provide the service. For this reason, it is important that travellers provide the requested documents or information and make every effort to give advance notice that includes two full business days. Note: A carrier is required to make a reasonable effort to transport a mobility aid or other assistive device even if the person does not provide advance notice or submit the information or documents required by the carrier. Why it is important to provide advance notice: Providing a carrier with adequate advance notice about the need to travel with a mobility aid or other assistive device will enable it to ensure that the aid can be carried on the transportation equipment that's scheduled for use on the trip and, if this isn't possible, advise the passenger what alternative trips are available for travelling with the mobility aid or assistive device. The carrier can also explain any restrictions; for example, on the number or types of batteries due to safety reasons, and whether there is a power supply on board the transportation equipment that can be used for an assistive device.\nProvide Information for the disassembly and reassembly of a mobility aid and arrive early ASL version of Provide Information for the disassembly and reassembly of a mobility aid and arrive early Continue to the next video: Chapter 7.

It\u2019s a daunting prospect, from train companies not turning up with ramps to scare stories about wheelchair parts going missing on flights. After years of travelling with mobility aids, I\u2019ve come up with the 16 best tips for travelling across the UK and abroad as a disabled person that will make your journey as easy as possible.\nMain photo: Passengers at an airport (Getty Images)\nThis article contains affiliate links.

Check your travel insurance\nFrustratingly, travel insurance costs more simply because you have a disability \u2014 but it\u2019s very important to get the right cover; listing long-term medical conditions and chronic illnesses will save you a fortune if you need medical attention on holiday. Remember that additional insurance to protect mobility aids may also be needed. Shop around for your insurance, a comparison website can show you the best deal depending on how much assistance you need.\n2. Pack enough medication\nAnd check that you can take it into the country you\u2019re visiting. Remembering your medication could be the difference between a good break away and a bad one. Cut down your chances of losing medication when you travel by packing it in separate bags \u2014 one lot in your suitcase, one lot in your hand luggage \u2014 it will mean you\u2019ve always got some to hand no matter what.\nSome countries limit how much of certain types of medication you can carry on one person at one time; strong painkillers are often restricted so get a dispensation letter from your doctor if you need one.\n3. Check with your GP for any extra immunisations\nWe all need jabs when we go to certain destinations but, with particular health conditions, you may need more. It\u2019s definitely worth booking an appointment with your GP or registered nurse to make sure you\u2019re covered.\nHollie-Anne Brooks in Paris\n4. Check you\u2019re fit to fly\nYour GP should also help check that you\u2019re fit to fly. Don\u2019t forget any extras you may need to take with you such as compression socks, spare feeding tubes or masks.\n5. Get a free (or discounted) space for your carer or PA\nTravelling often means having to take a personal assistant with you and if you need multiple carers this can soon add up. Thankfully, you can get discounts \u2014 and often get free spaces. Eurostar, for example, only has wheelchair spaces in standard premier or business class but you will get these at the price of standard tickets; this includes one seat at standard price for your carer too.\n6. Remember all your mobility aids\nMany of us use different mobility aids for different days. If you\u2019re an ambulatory wheelchair user, are you also going to need to take a walking stick with you? Do you need different mobility aids to cover all terrains you might experience on your trip?\nAn airport lift for passengers who use wheelchairs (Getty Images)\n7. Familiarise yourself with the procedure for checking-in mobility aids\nDon\u2019t panic about being without your wheels when flying. Your wheelchair will be stored with the luggage and you\u2019ll be given another to transport you around airports at either end and to and from your seat. If your personal wheelchair or mobility aid comes with specialist storage instructions or needs to be handled in a certain way, make sure the airline knows and you know where, when and how your mobility aid will be returned to you.\n8. Use websites like AccessAble to plan your trip\nAccessAble provides full reviews and information about everything from where the accessible public toilets are in a city to which hotels offer accessible spa access. Plan ahead, including where you are going to eat, and make sure any companies you book through are aware of your access needs and have ramps, working lifts, braille menus and anything else you may require.\nEuan\u2019s Guide provides similar reviews and allows disabled people to leave reviews of different aspects of their visit to certain attractions, so you can get a first-hand account of what you\u2019re about to experience.\n9. Use a specialist travel agents\nSome travel agents, such as Travel Counsellors, specialise in creating incredible accessible travel experiences. If you\u2019re unsure where to even begin, use a specialist agency who can cover everything for you from booking your transfers to and from the hotel to whether the swimming pool has a hoist to which spas have wheelchair accessible treatment rooms.\n10. Consider renting a mobility device\nMany hotels, museums, cruise ships and holiday resorts have mobility scooters and wheelchairs that you can often rent free of charge or for a small fee. Airport assistance will be able to transport you around the airport in a wheelchair or on a buggy and, once you arrive at your destination, check out the range of mobility aids on offer to help get you round the resort.\nMake sure your hotel room has space for your service animal to work, rest and play (Alamy)\n11. Make sure your accommodation has enough room for your service animal\nIf you\u2019re travelling with a service animal, such as a guide dog, make sure the hotel room you\u2019re provided with has enough room for your animal to work, rest and play. Look for hotels with large grounds so you can walk your animal and know your rights \u2014 it is illegal for anyone in the UK to turn away someone with a guide dog, whether that be when entering a taxi or going to a restaurant.\n12. Take an extension lead\nA multi-plug extension lead will become your best friend on holiday; if you\u2019ve got an electric wheelchair to charge and other pieces of equipment that require electricity then the one plug socket that\u2019s not by the bed isn\u2019t going to help. Take an extension lead so you can plug your equipment into multiple holes and have the power connected right next to where you need it.\nSee our pick of the best hotels with accessible rooms\nWhile you\u2019re there\n13. Pace yourself\nIt can be tempting to take part in a tonne of activities, visit all the museums and galleries and spend the night working your way through the cocktail menu but it\u2019s important to remember to pace yourself to keep your health in its best shape for as long as possible.\n14. Embrace train and airport lounges\nOn Eurostar, for example, all disabled people can use the business lounge whether you\u2019re travelling business class or not. I like to use this time to familiarise myself with my itinerary, as well as enjoy the perks such as free snacks, wine and beer.\n15. Use your blue badge\nWe may not be in the EU anymore but your blue badge for parking that you use in the UK is still valid across the EU. Outside of the EU, different rules apply so make sure to check the country\u2019s driving and parking rules ahead of time to avoid a potential fine.\n16. Check foreign public transport\nNot all transport abroad will be as equipped for disabled people as what we\u2019re used to in the UK. Check to see if you need to book assistance or make any other amendments.\nWhere can I travel without a vaccine?"}]
