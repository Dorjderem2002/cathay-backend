Please read these before first using your card.\nTaxi operators in Auckland\nOnly some taxi operators accept Total Mobility cards. Find out which taxi operators in Auckland accept Total Mobility and which areas they operate in.\nWe recommend you book ahead\nWe recommend that where possible you book ahead when you wish to use Total Mobility. This is for three main reasons:\nYou can tell the taxi operator\u2019s Call Centre you are a Total Mobility client. Not all the drivers for our taxi operators can take Total Mobility clients. We require a higher standard of training for our drivers to support your safety and dignity. Not all operators have 100% of their drivers trained to this higher standard.\nDuring the evening and weekend there are fewer taxis on the road. This is particularly the case for wheelchair accessible taxi vans.\nYou can tell the taxi operator if you need extra help e.g. have the taxi come up your drive to pick you up.\nBooking ahead gives you more certainty that your travel will be easy.\nCarry your Total Mobility card when you travel\nYou must have your Total Mobility card with you when you travel. Your card will need to be \u2018swiped\u2019 by the driver in the taxi so your travel subsidy can be paid by Auckland Transport.\nFares\nAuckland Transport subsidises 75% of the taxi fare, up to a maximum fare cap of $80 per trip. For trips over $80, Auckland Transport will only pay a maximum subsidy of $60.\nCarer support\nYou can take a carer to travel with you if you need support to make your trip easier. Your carer can be a paid carer, a family member or friend.\nTravel restrictions\nYou can use your Total Mobility card for most trips you want to take. There are, however, a few restrictions. These are set out in section 5 of the Total Mobility conditions of use.\nThe main restrictions are:\nYou must use your Total Mobility AT HOP card in a responsible manner including taking the most efficient route and minimising use where possible.\nThat the trip must be for your travel, not for someone else\u2019s travel.\nPlease read section 5 of the Total Mobility conditions of use for the full list of restrictions.\nComplaints\nSometimes things don't go as well as they should. If you are unhappy with the service you receive, firstly raise the issue with the taxi operator, if you are still unhappy contact Auckland Transport call centre at 09 366 6400.\nIf you need to complain, ask the driver for a receipt. When you complain provide as much information as possible about what\u2019s gone wrong, for example time, date, cab number. This makes it much easier for both the taxi operator and Auckland Transport to investigate the issue.\nBus, train, ferry and the accessibility concession\nIf you have the Total Mobility card then:\nIt will have the AT accessibility concession set up on it. The accessibility concession gives you discounted travel when you use bus, train and ferries. You will need to load \u2018money\u2019 onto the card (just like a normal HOP card) to travel.\nIf you have one of the older style TM cards you can still get a blue HOP card with the accessible concession or apply to get your current AT TM HOP card replaced with one of the new ones.\nYour Total Mobility card also gives you the PlusOne Bus Companion concession on the bus. Find out how Plus One Bus Companion making bus travel more accessible. This allows you to take a carer with you on the bus for free. Just make sure you tell the driver that you are using PlusOne.\nThe accessibility concession together with the PlusOne concession will make your travel cheaper for those times when you can use scheduled public transport.\nTotal Mobility Newsletter\nWe send out an email newsletter each month providing further information about Total Mobility and other public transport news. If you would like to be added to the newsletter distribution list, please contact totalmobility@at.govt.nz.\nTravelling outside of Auckland\nThe Total Mobility scheme operates throughout New Zealand and allows arrangements with other local authorities to receive discounted travel in their region.\nTotal Mobility doesn\u2019t operate in all centres in New Zealand. The maximum subsidy may also be much less than in Auckland. Please check the website for the region you are going to visit before travelling.\nVisitors to Auckland\nIf you are visiting Auckland and you have a Total Mobility card issued by your local regional council, you can use the card in Auckland.\nIf you have an electronic card, it can be swiped by Auckland taxi card readers.\nIf your local scheme doesn't issue electronic cards, ask your regional council for a voucher.\nIf you use a voucher, you will need to ask the Auckland taxi operator to process a manual transaction.

To find accessible hotels, first search for hotels in your destination, and then check the \u201cIncreased accessibility\u201d box in the \u201cAmenities\u201d filters on the left-hand side of the page. This filter reveals properties that offer these features: wheelchair accessible, facilities for disabled guests, in-room accessibility, accessible rooms, facilities for disabled guests, and disabled access.\nPlaya del Carmen, Mexico\nOne hour from Canc\u00fan International Airport, Playa Del Carmen is a far cry from its more revelrous neighbor, yet still has accessible hotels and an accessible beach furnished with beach wheelchairs. There\u2019s even adaptive equipment to allow you to go snorkeling to enjoy the coral reef and green turtles. But the main reason for coming here is to visit the nearby and largely wheelchair-accessible Mayan archaeological sites, Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 and Tulum, a rare chance for the mobility-impaired to get up close to ancient ruins.\nSan Diego skyline from the harbor \u00a9 David Toussaint / Getty Images\nSan Diego, California, USA\nWith the Americans with Disabilities Act having just celebrated its 30th anniversary, much of the USA\u2019s infrastructure is accessible, but our pick is San Diego. Laid out along the classic grid system, generally flat and with a fully accessible trolley system, it also boasts a balmy year-round 64-80\u00b0F climate.\nThe historic Gaslamp Quarter is very wheelchair friendly, as is the massive Balboa Park (incorporating the slightly hilly San Diego Zoo), but it\u2019s the miles of beachfront promenade with beach wheelchairs available \u2013 including a motorized one with caterpillar tracks at Mission Beach! \u2013 that are the main attraction.\nBarcelona, Spain\nWith the national tourism authority and Catalonia in particular pushing accessible travel, it\u2019s no surprise that wheelchair users have been flocking to Barcelona. With 80% of the metro stations and 100% of buses wheelchair-accessible, as well as a relatively flat and cobblestone-free old city, getting around is a breeze.\nWhat\u2019s more, wheelchair users not only jump to the front of the queue for attractions such as the breathtaking Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, they often get in for free! You can explore the length of La Rambla and get around the famous Mercat de la Boqueria; even the beach has wheelchair access and people on hand to help.\nWelcome to Las Vegas \u00a9 Michael Phillips / Getty Images\nLas Vegas, Nevada, USA\nLas Vegas is undoubtedly one of the most accessible cities for people with disabilities in the US. Of course, the casinos and the venues hosting world-renowned musicians and shows are all wheelchair accessible, as are the vast majority of sites and attractions, many of which \u2013 like the Fountains of Bellagio and the Fremont Street Experience \u2013 are completely free.\nMore surprising, perhaps, the High Roller \u2013 the tallest observation wheel in the world, which takes 30 minutes to do a full revolution \u2013 is also wheelchair-accessible. And if you\u2019re after an adrenaline rush, wheelchair users can even enjoy the SlotZilla Zip Line and the Zoomline, which reach speeds of up to 35 miles an hour, or a hot-air balloon ride over the city.\nAdd to this a very wide choice in accessible accommodation, easy exploration along the wide sidewalks of the Strip, a fully accessible bus service that serves all parts of the city, and plenty of wheelchair-accessible taxis and you can begin to understand why Las Vegas has become something of a destination for wheelchair users.\nManchester, UK\nAlthough it was the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, much of central Manchester was rebuilt in the late 1990s, making smooth, wide, step-free pavements, as well as stepless entry into shops, restaurants and bars the norm \u2013 ideal for anyone with mobility requirements.\nNorthern England\u2019s cultural hub is well served by accessible public transport, leaving you free to pay homage at Old Trafford, learn about our industrial roots at the Museum of Science and Industry or shop with the goths at Affleck\u2019s. And if you\u2019ve had enough of the city, the Peak District National Park, with well-developed facilities for visitors with disabilities, is less than an hour away.\nA piazza in Taormina, Sicily \u00a9 Matt Munro / Lonely Planet\nSicily, Italy\nItaly might not spring to mind as a very accessible destination due to its narrow, often cobblestone streets. But there are a number of tour operators that cater to travelers with disabilities. Motor-impaired travelers can enjoy scuba diving, 4WD off-road driving, traditional Sicilian fishing and olive oil making \u2013 not to mention the gastronomic delights normally associated with Italy. Indeed, two Guinness world records have been set here: first paraplegic to dive to 59m and first blind woman to dive to 41m!\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania, USA\nAs one of the oldest cities in the US, you might not expect Philadelphia to be very accessible \u2013 but it is! While the Old Town may offer some challenges for wheelchair users, sidewalks are generally well maintained in the more touristed areas, with plenty of curb cuts and tactile markings.\nThis is particularly useful for wheelchair users considering most of the city\u2019s attractions are within a two-mile radius of the City Hall. The subway, opened in 1907, is only partially wheelchair-accessible, as is the overland rail network, but unfortunately the aging trolley system is not. However, the city\u2019s fleet of more than 1000 buses are all low-floor and wheelchair-accessible, as is the PHLASH tourist bus which runs a continuous loop downtown, stopping at many popular attractions, and costs only $5 for an all-day pass.\nNeedless to say, all of the city\u2019s most popular attractions \u2013 including Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell, Love Park and the Philadelphia Museum of Art \u2013 are fully wheelchair-accessible despite their antiquity. And when it comes to finding accommodations, there are plenty of wheelchair-friendly options right in the center of the action.\nSandridge Bridge in Melbourne, Australia \u00a9 Catherine Sutherland / Lonely Planet\nMelbourne, Australia\nWith its highly accessible public transport system and compact city center, Melbourne is one of the most accessible cities in the world.

Discover Melbourne\u2019s best wheelchair-friendly restaurants, enjoy spectacular scenery along the Great Ocean Road, and visit one of the world\u2019s best zoos as well as many of the parks that progressive Parks Victoria is opening up to visitors with access needs.\nLjubljana, Slovenia\nSlovenia\u2019s flat and largely pedestrianized capital, served by accessible electric vehicles, is well worth a visit. Most of its buses are accessible, but the city is so small, with plenty of ramps and curb cuts, you might rarely need them.\nThe city\u2019s main drawcard, the 16th-century Ljubljana Castle is reached via a funicular (free for people with disabilities and a companion) or train, both wheelchair-accessible. Many of Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik\u2019s famous bridges have recently been made accessible, and were joined in 2010 by the award-winning Butchers\u2019 Bridge, which allows wheelchair users access to boats.\nSingapore has established accessibility requirements into its city code \u00a9 Ninnat Fongsupa / 500px\nSingapore\nSingapore has to be the most accessible city in Asia and one of the most accessible cities in the world. Its universal code on barrier-free accessibility, in place for decades, plus increasing affluence have resulted in an infrastructure with stepless access to most buildings and no shortage of curb cuts.\nAlthough power wheelchair-friendly taxis aren\u2019t common, the accessibility of the mass rail transit (MRT) and buses makes them unnecessary. In Singapore, the question is not \u201cwhat is accessible?\u201d but rather \u201cwhat isn\u2019t?\u201d \u2013 from its street food hawker centers to its marvelous zoo.\nVienna, Austria\nLike many European cities, Vienna is steeped in history, being the center of the former Habsburg Empire and the musical heart of Europe. Unlike many of its counterparts, however, its cobblestones have been removed, as have many of the curbs.\nThe refurbished city is both flat and compact, with most central shops and cafes fully accessible. Getting around is relatively easy with elevators to the metro and plenty of low-floor trams. Most museums and places of interest are fully accessible, including the must-see Schloss Sch\u00f6nbrunn.\nYou might also like:\nTake a spin around the globe with an accessible travel expert\nWhat I have learned from travelling the world with a wheelchair"}, {"title": "All Inclusive Holidays", "article": "All Inclusive Holidays\nThere is nothing quite as soothing as a luxury holiday spent within the embracing environs of an all-inclusive resort, a holiday oasis where the cares of the world seem to just slip away.

These recommendations aim to guide the decision-makers of natural resources in tourism in undertaking accessibility improvements. The document has a particular focus on facilitating access to protected areas, beaches and parks. The WCPA Tourism and Protected Areas Specialist Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT), acted as the expert reviewers. Their involvement was key in identifying the best actions geared towards a greater extent of accessibility and inclusiveness within nature areas, vis a vis tourism. The guidance tool, whose drafting was led by UNWTO, the ONCE Foundation and UNE, is part of the promotion of ISO Standard 21902:2021. Download here the guidelines in English and Spanish.\nRecommendations for cultural tourism key players on accessibility UNWTO, Fundaci\u00f3n ONCE and UNE issued in September 2023, a set of guidelines targeting key players of the cultural tourism ecosystem, who wish to make their offerings more accessible.\nThe key partners in the drafting and expert review process were the ICOMOS International Cultural Tourism Committee and the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT). The ICOMOS experts\u2019 input was key in covering crucial action areas where accessibility needs to be put in the spotlight, in order to make cultural experiences more inclusive for all people.\nThis guidance tool is also framed within the promotion of the ISO Standard ISO 21902, in whose development UNWTO had one of the leading roles.

This is a key tool to understand specific actions that can be undertaken by a wide range of organizations entrusted with designing policies, strategies and destination marketing plans in the sphere of accessible tourism.

The first ATD was awarded in 2019 and has been temporarily put on hold, given the pandemic.\nVideo \"Change your destination\" The video \u201cChange your destination\u201d was issued by Fundaci\u00f3n ONCE and UNWTO by the occasion of the 2019 International Fair of Tourism (FITUR). Facilitating travel for people with disabilities is an exceptional business opportunity. Yet, a change in mind-set and in the model of tourism services provision is needed in order to meet this major market demand. Accessible environments and services contribute to improve the quality of the tourism product and can create more job opportunities for people with disabilities. Accessibility, therefore, must be an intrinsic part of any responsible and sustainable tourism policy and strategy.\nWorld Tourism Day 2016: \"Tourism for All - promoting universal accessibility\" To mark the celebration of the World Tourism Day 2016 under the theme \"Tourism for All - promoting universal accessibility\" UNWTO, the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT) and the Spanish ONCE Foundation for the Social Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities have produced a compilation of Good Practices in the Accessible Tourism Supply Chain.

In doing so, accessible tourism futures are shown to be affected by key concepts related to core tourism considerations and major policy initiatives on accessibility and sustainability. Yet, accessible tourism futures also have the potential to create their own momentum and contribute unique learnings on the diversity of tourism markets that will shape tourism concepts and global policy initiatives in their own right.\nA discussion of each of the above areas was placed in context to accessible tourism futures and to contextualise the papers that were selected for the special issue. The latter part of the paper outlines the contribution of each empirical paper to the issue discussing the approach, findings and implications. Stakeholder collaboration was identified as the key common theme of the papers and the factor for developing accessible tourism solutions, recognising the value of the market and capitalising on it. A collaborative approach is required to recognise the complementary nature of the different paradigms; to re-shape and transform the future of the accessible tourism industry. To assist in the development of accessible tourism futures, UD principles should provide a foundation to enhance the future competitiveness of tourism destinations and organisations.\nThree of the authors have extensive academic experience in the area and the fourth author is the Managing Director of the pre-eminent European Network for Accessible Tourism. In taking a limited Delphi approach to canvassing key areas likely to shape accessible tourism futures, the following concepts and policy initiatives were examined: motivations, dreams and aspirations of people with disability; demography; UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; destination competitiveness; universal design (UD); and the UN Sustainable Development Goals for 2030.\nAccessible tourism is evolving as a field of academic research and industry practice, set within a dynamic social context.

The special issue explores theoretical approaches, foundations and issues in the study of accessible tourism from a futures perspective. Accessible tourism, as with any area of academic study is an evolving field of academic research and industry practice, set within a dynamic social context. The field is interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary, and is influenced by geography, ageing and disability studies, economics, public policy, psychology, law, architecture, construction sciences, technology and marketing. Past research has attempted to view, explain and unpack the inherent complexities (Darcy, 2010) within accessible tourism through a variety of lenses, including human rights, critical tourism, embodiment, customer segmentation and universal design (UD), to name a few (see Buhalis and Darcy, 2011; Buhalis et al., 2012). The special issue is timely given the operationalisation of the United Nations (2006) Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities by 160 countries. Central to the convention is the right for tourists with disability to access transport and built environment in Article 9 and tourism experiences, goods and services within Article 30. It is therefore pertinent to look at the future of accessible tourism and contemplate a number of issues including (but not limited to) the role of technology in reshaping disability; if and how policy makers and planners are addressing the impact of accessible tourism in a sustainable manner; the political influence of people with disabilities, who make up the largest minority group in the USA, on the future of tourism; the science fiction of exoskeletons and gene therapy as a new form of adventure tourist; and the future state of embodied identity and accessible tourism. The special issue provides the opportunity for contributors to take part in the current discourses on accessible tourism from a futures perspective, in order that we can understand, manage and contribute to the development of accessible tourism in the context of economically, socially and environmentally sustainable communities. Specific topics included conceptual and research papers, viewpoints and trend papers, both qualitative and quantitative, discussing topics relating to the future of accessible tourism. Papers include a range of issues including: inclusive destinations; accessible tourism in Development Planning (toward the UN Sustainable Development Goals 2030); policy-making for accessible tourism; embodiment; representation; law and legislation; architecture and universal design; inclusion/exclusion from experiences; markets and needs analysis; accessible transport; accessible events; accessibility and culture/heritage; accessible accommodation; education/training; and technology and applications. In contrast to the past 30 years, where disability and tourism research has been largely concerned with overcoming barriers that exclude certain people (see Smith, 1987), we can discern the contours of new movements in accessible tourism, whereby overarching principles and standards of sustainability, social responsibility and customer service. The delivery of equitable tourism experiences demand the attention of sector actors and stakeholders. Accessible tourism, in this context, should be seen in the future as much more than a range of supports to excluded target groups, becoming a set of ground rules and codes of practice which contribute to the development of all tourism offers and destinations in an inclusive way. If we should gaze into the crystal ball for a moment, we could envisage that tourism will not be defined primarily in terms of different target groups, since principles of responsibility, sustainability and accessibility will in the future inform the quality criteria to which all destinations should comply and be judged as part of destination competitiveness in increasingly global context. Customers will become more aware of their individual rights and also the need to protect and sustain communities and the natural environment, influencing tourism service providers to follow generally accepted rules of service quality, genuine interactivity and engagement with the local culture, people and resources. The capability of tourism providers to recognise those rights for all (e.g. of tourists with disabilities, Design for All, responsible behaviour, inclusion of the local communities in a transparent system of remuneration and participation, working opportunities for socially excluded group etc.) is going to be the threshold, which determines whether their offers will succeed or fail in the future. The tourism sector will increasingly be seen as having transformational power as \u201ca shaper of society\u201d, acting as a promoter of jobs and economic growth, a participant in regional and community planning and a partner in global development programmes. In addition, tourism should be developed as industry that promotes understanding, inclusion and well-being for all in an equitable way. Businesses, destinations and networks, that are already active in the field of accessible tourism and/or representing markets with different specific requirements will participate more widely in the mainstream, bringing their expertise and knowledge to bear on all those issues that are still seen as \u201cdifferent types of tourism\u201d. In the development of accessible destinations and experiences, the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (2015) will be playing an increasingly supportive role, especially through its Global Code for Ethics in Tourism and the recently published Manuals on Accessible Tourism (2015), produced by ONCE Foundation and the European Network for Accessible Tourism (2015b). Before discussing the papers that have been selected for publication we would like to set the scene by examining some major conceptual and policy development areas that we believe will have a significant influence on accessible tourism futures in the future. These include: dreams and aspirations of people with disability; demography; UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; destination competitiveness frameworks; UD; and the newly adopted UN Sustainable Development Goals for 2030. Each of these areas of influence will now be outlined prior to the papers for the special edition being summarised for their contribution to the future of accessible tourism.\nDefining and conceptualising accessible tourism Conceptualising accessible tourism to reflect all its dimensions and multidisciplinarity is critical for the future. The study of tourism and disability has been a reasonably recent phenomenon with the first detailed examination emerging from the leisure constraints literature (Smith, 1987). From this beginning, a great deal of individual studies are emerged that documented significant issues with demand, supply and coordination of travel for people with disability. More recently the field has started to mature with a conceptualisation that has sought to make sense out of the individual studies and provide an overall framework for understanding the phenomena. To assist with this conceptualisation, Buhalis and Darcy (2011) offer the following definition: Accessible tourism is a form of tourism that involves collaborative processes between stakeholders that enables people with access requirements, including mobility, vision, hearing and cognitive dimensions of access, to function independently and with equity and dignity through the delivery of universally designed tourism products, services and environments. This definition adopts a whole of life approach where people through their lifespan benefit from accessible tourism provision. These include people with permanent and temporary disabilities, seniors, obese, families with young children and those working in safer and more socially sustainably designed environments (adapted from Darcy and Dickson, 2009, p. 34 in Buhalis and Darcy, 2011, pp. 10-11). Importantly the definition recognises collaboration between stakeholders across demand, supply and coordination to recognise that disability is a complex construct involving mobility, vision, hearing, cognitive and other embodiments. The definition recognises that developing inclusive destinations and accessible tourism experiences also benefit other groups in the community. Hence, it contributes toward a greater social sustainability of the industry by including and, hence, providing for a much broader cross-section of consumers that has previously been considered by the industry. In understanding the importance of individuals with disability, the stakeholders they engage with and the influence of UD on the products, services and environments they wish to seek enabling experiences. Buhalis and Darcy (2011) suggests that to develop accessible tourism futures destination managers must strategically plan through the lens of UD. Figure 1 outlines the cyclical strategic approach to engaging UD approaches across disability and lifespan considerations as a foundation for developing future accessible destination experiences.\nDreams and aspirations of people with disability The dreams and aspirations of individuals play a fundamental role in shaping the choices, which lead them to travel. Among people who live with a disability, the idea of leaving behind one\u2019s everyday surroundings and going on a journey can create significant anxiety (Darcy, 1998). People with disability often can design or influence their everyday environment whilst they have routines to negotiate any difficulties and thresholds that exist. This does not apply to new environments whilst travelling, where they do not have prior knowledge, networks or influence on the design nor the potential barriers that are to face and the way to overcome them. Indeed, a recent European survey (GfK, 2015) suggests that up to half of people with disability do not travel on holiday, due to a combination of lack of reliable information, lack of funds and previous bad experiences. Yet, the desire to travel remains with studies showing that it is not a person\u2019s impairment that impedes their travel but a series of interpersonal, attitudinal structural constraints (Daniels et al., 2005; Darcy, 2003). In recognising that a person's impairment does not constrain their travel motivations, the boundaries to what is regarded as accessible tourism destinations and experiences are continually pushed by the accessible explorers who forge new pathways for others to follow.\nMillennium development goals (MDGs) and the UN global compact At the Millennium Summit in September 2000 the largest gathering of world leaders in history adopted the UN Millennium Declaration, committing their nations to a global partnership to reduce extreme poverty and setting a series of targets, with a deadline of 2015. These targets, known as the MDGs are a set of eight specific goals set by the 191 United Nations member countries that have the goal of halving world poverty by the year 2015: Eradicating extreme poverty continues to be one of the main challenges of our time, and is a major concern of the international community. Ending this scourge will require the combined efforts of all, governments, civil society organizations and the private sector, in the context of a stronger and more effective global partnership for development. The Millennium Development Goals set timebound targets, by which progress in reducing income poverty, hunger, disease, lack of adequate shelter and exclusion \u2013 while promoting gender equality, health, education and environmental sustainability \u2013 can be measured. They also embody basic human rights \u2013 the rights of each person on the planet to health, education, shelter and security. The Goals are ambitious but feasible and, together with the comprehensive United Nations development agenda, set the course for the world\u2019s efforts to alleviate extreme poverty by 2015 (United Nations Secretary-General BAN Ki-moon). The aim of the MDGs is to encourage development by improving social and economic conditions in the world\u2019s poorest countries. Since the MDG\u2019s were agreed to significant progress has been made. To date average overall incomes have increased by approximately 21 per cent. The number of people living in extreme poverty declined by an estimated 130 million. Chile mortality rates fell from 103 deaths per 1,000 live births a year to 88. Life expectancy rose from 63 years to 65 years. An additional 8 per cent of the developing world\u2019s people received access to clean water and an additional 15 per cent acquired access to improved sanitation services. In 2015 the UN countries will adopt a new sustainable development agenda and a new global agreement on climate change. The actions taken in 2015 are expected to result in new sustainable development goals that build on the eight MDG\u2019s (United Nations, 2015). Tourism has long been seen as having significant potential to help achieve the MDG\u2019s in developing countries. For example in 1990 developing countries had 18 per cent of international tourism receipts. By 2005 this had risen to 30 per cent and to date it continues to rise. There has been significant promotion of the direct economic links between tourists and the poor. Tourism may provide employment opportunities for marginalised groups, may bring direct income to individual communities and may promote equality in developing countries (Saarinen and Rogerson, 2013).\nUD supports destination competitiveness The tourism industry needs to design and deliver offerings and services that are suitable to all potential users and remove any physical or organisational barriers that can prevent visitation. UD incorporates the accessibility requirements of people with the widest possible range of abilities, so that the greatest number of people can use mainstream products and services without the need for adaptations or special interfaces. Additionally, mainstream products and services should use interface standards which match those of technical aids, so allowing disabled people to access and use mainstream equipment. UD has been defined as: Universal design is the design of products and environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design. The intent of the universal design concept is to simplify life for everyone by making products, communications, and the built environment more usable by more people at little or no extra cost. The universal design concept targets all people of all ages, sizes and abilities\u2019. The Universal Design approach goes beyond traditional design, which tends to focus on the \u2018average\u2019 user. Universal Design is a design approach, reflecting a way of understanding people\u2019s needs. It is not a list of particular solutions, measurements, or products \u2013 Universal Design is the way to reach the solution, contributing to social inclusion (cited in Center for Universal Design, 2009; and first articulated by Mace, 1985). Applying the principles of UD can be seen as a way of developing tourism environments, transportation, services and offers, underpinning sustainable communities and businesses. Today, according to a recent study by European Network for Accessible Tourism (2015a) and partners, less than 10 per cent of tourism suppliers in Europe offer \u201caccessible\u201d tourism services, while demand for such services is set to increase due to the ageing population and continuing upward trend in market demand. Adopting UD enlarges the target markets of destinations as well as ensures that more pleasant experiences can be delivered. Therefore it can increase the market base, reduce seasonality and support the competitiveness of destinations (Buhalis, 2000). Yet, few studies have examined accessible tourism in relation to destination management and only recently has accessible tourism been examined from destination competitiveness perspective (Dom\u00ednguez Vila et al., 2015).\nPapers in this issue To address these concepts and developments this special issue is bringing a range of papers together that discuss research on many accessibility tourism aspects. Naniopoulos and Tsalis (2015) discuss a methodology for addressing the accessibility of monuments. They focus on heritage attraction sites, highlighting the challenges with archaeological sites where interventions become problematic or even impossible. In doing so, they approached accessibility as a dual notion; accessibility of an area and its potential for independent physical access and movement around the monuments as well as perceived accessibility in terms of interpreting, understanding and learning from the environment. The methodology was applied to a number of byzantine monuments as part of a cultural route in the city of Thessaloniki in Greece, as case studies. Results provide both tools for assessing monument accessibility (process orientations and checklists) and insights into the needs of travellers with disabilities for more \u201cusable\u201d heritage attractions. Concluding remarks place a focus on the prerequisites of training and cooperation to allow for the future of accessible monuments to be realised. Tsalis et al. (2015) provide an interesting study on the challenges of implementing accessibility solutions, also within the context of protection, conservation, and management of historical centres and monuments. Viewed from a tourism perspective, archaeological sites and monuments are location bound and exist only in their original place. Hence, access to such sites enables unique and authentic tourism experiences. Discourses on objective, constructive and existential authenticity are of paramount importance when accessibility is concerned. This study provides relevant examples of accessibility interventions on six monuments as well as considerations on the design of the tools that assisted site interpretation and interconnection in a cultural route. Results demonstrate how accessibility improvements can occur while respecting the history, architecture and character of the monuments. The study concludes by emphasizing that it is primarily through providing greater access, that the \u201csocialisation\u201d of these monuments will propagate authentic tourism experiences in the future. Bowtell (2015) offers an examination of the market value and attractiveness of accessible tourism in Europe. Historic data were used to provide a forecast for 2025, while primary data obtained from travel and leisure companies provided insights into managerial perceptions. Findings show a very promising potential for accessible tourism market with significant projected revenues. However, a number of challenges including lack of awareness, cost of investments, complexity of customers\u2019 needs and legal inconsistencies within the EU, create barriers toward developing comprehensive solutions for accessible tourism. Authors provide recommendations on bridging demand and supply. Gillovic and McIntosh (2015) present an interesting study on stakeholder perspectives of the future of accessible tourism in New Zealand. The study provides insights into the current situation and the future propensity for an accessible tourism industry in New Zealand. A number of interviews with key stakeholders revealed that there is a need to develop a culture of accessibility that is perceived as the norm. Findings also include the business and demand arguments, but additionally highlighted the \u201cineptness\u201d of upper industry levels to recognize the opportunity of accessible tourism, exhibiting apathy and complacency instead. Authors conclude with recommendations for the future of accessible tourism in New Zealand which can easily be generalised for other regions. Zajadacz (2015) discusses the evolution of models of disability as a basis for the future development of accessible tourism. A review of medical, social, biopsychosocial, geographical and economic models of disability reveals the theoretical underpinnings and assumptions entailed in those. These are then linked to tourism, demonstrating that different models influence the tourism provision in terms of both products and services. Authors highlight the understanding of disability under different models toward diverse tourism experiences. Several suggestions are offered on the complementary of the models and the implications on the transformation of the accessible tourism industry in the future. Cruces Portales (2015) uses a scenario planning approach to envisage alternative futures for accessible tourism. With a timeframe leading to 2050, four alternative futures are unravelled through storytelling. The scenarios are built on a matrix that includes the opposing forces of empathy \u2013 apathy, and fear of loss and certainty of benefits. The resulting, aptly named scenarios (Eden Gardens, Golden Bridge, Wasted Future and State of Hope) showcase different behaviours, schedules of changes and insights. Authors conclude with strategic ideas and proposals for the future of accessible tourism.\nConclusion When exploring the future of tourism in this area two opposing trends can be observed: future societies are predicted to become more similar, more homogenous as a consequence of consumerism, globalisation and converging urban lifestyles. However, the accessible tourism market is characteristically diverse, with complex needs and the range of dreams and ambitions is boundless. Will future global travellers be able to access more varied and personal services or will increasing numbers of travellers give rise to greater standardization of services? Accessible tourism as an emerging field of study will influence tourism destination competitiveness in the future, whether that be from a human rights, emerging market segment or service delivery perspective. In this conceptual examination, we have presented implications of number of theoretical constructs and lenses through which accessible tourism will be influenced in the future. In this special issue, a number of future dimensions are explored that demonstrate how the field has moved from an examination of the intersection of disability and tourism, to one that is clearly defined through conceptual and definitional approaches as accessible tourism. There is a common thread amongst all the papers presented in this special issue. They focus around stakeholder collaboration, as a foundation for the future development of accessible tourism. It has been explicitly suggested that raising awareness amongst stakeholders is essential to overcome barriers inhibiting the application of solutions that enhance access. The importance of stakeholder collaboration across the accessible tourism value chain has been emphasized in a number of ways in this special issue. Improving accessibility of facilities, transportation, attractions and destinations more generally, demands the collaboration of a wide range of stakeholders including architects, designers, economists, local councils, policy makers, travellers with disabilities, historians and archaeologists to name a few. Therefore \u201csocialising\u201d tourism means that access can be granted only when a number of relevant stakeholders are in accord, work together and specifically developed strategies to target the accessible tourism market. Stakeholder collaboration is a key factor for developing accessible tourism solutions, recognising the value of the market and capitalising on it. Hence, a collaborative approach is required to recognise the complementary nature of the different paradigms; to re-shape and transform the future of the accessible tourism through influencing the tourism industry, contributing government organisations and the not-for-profit sectors. The strength and depth of stakeholder collaborations will determine alternative future realities; from a future where all cooperate and share benefits for all parties, to a fatalistic picture where each stakeholder is sailing alone because they consider their interests incompatible, and everything in between. UD should provide a better accessible tourism future that should enhance the competitiveness of tourism destinations and organisations."}, {"title": "Ethical: Barrier Free Tourism", "article": "Tourism Accessible for All in Europe\nJoe McClain\nFor those who associate tourism only with holiday and leisure and luxury it should be mentioned that tourism is a sector of remarkable economic importance.

Around the world, despite having the time and money to travel, millions of people with disabilities or reduced mobility are unable to do so due to a lack of facilities. What is more, because of the demographic change in many countries and the growing desire of the elderly to travel, potential demand in this market will rise significantly. These are the findings of the latest ITB World Travel Trends Report, compiled by IPK International and commissioned by ITB Berlin.\nAccording to Lilian M\u00fcller, President of the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT), the most recent statistics reveal that in Europe alone there are 80 million people with disabilities: \u201dGlobal estimates range from 600 million to 900 million.\u201c That means that with world\u2019s population now at seven billion, about ten per cent require barrier-free and easily accessible facilities.\nCommenting, Dr. Martin Buck, director of the Competence Center Travel & Logistics, Messe Berlin, said: \u201cIt is important for the global travel industry to exploit this potential, as removing barriers enables not only the disabled to enjoy stress-free holidays. Other groups, for example families with young children, accident victims and the elderly, also benefit from barrier-free arrangements.\u201c\nLack of arrangements hampers market growth\nThe economic importance of this market is huge: US adults with disabilities or reduced mobility spend around 13.6 billion dollars on travel every year. In Germany, turnover in this market is estimated at around 2.5 billion euros and in the UK at almost two billion pounds. \u201cIn the future these figures may well rise\u201c, said Lilian M\u00fcller. In recent years, around 37 per cent of disabled people in Germany have decided not to travel due to a lack of easily accessible facilities. However, 48 per cent would travel more if the necessary arrangements existed. 60 per cent would even be willing to pay higher travel costs for better accessibility.\nAccording to Lilian M\u00fcller, barrier-free tourism should no longer be a niche market: \u201cAccessibility arrangements must be part of every single travel package. There is also a demand for specialist operators to offer services for customers with greater mobility needs\u201c, she added. The internet represents an important platform for achieving a barrier-free future. That means tour operators and travel agencies making their internet information accessible to blind and deaf persons. According to a survey by ENAT, in 2011 only 10 out of 39 websites could be accessed by the disabled.\nThe ITB World Travel Trends Report has more information on barrier-free tourism as well as details of every survey on global tourism trends. It can be downloaded at www.itb-berlin.com. The report is based on the assessments of 50 tourism experts from 30 countries, on a special IPK International trend analysis undertaken in leading source markets, and on core data supplied by the World Travel Monitor\u00ae, recognised as the largest continuous survey of global travel trends in some 60 source countries. The findings reflect trends which emerged during the first eight months of 2012. At the ITB Berlin Convention Rolf Freitag, CEO of IPK International, will present the findings for the entire year, as well as the latest forecasts for 2013.\nFrom 10.30 to 11.45 on Friday, 8 March 2013 at the ITB Berlin Convention, a keynote panel will examine \u201cBarrier-free tourism for everyone: quality and success criteria for ensuring the marketability of destinations.\u201d"}, {"title": "Accessible transport options throughout New Zealand including bus, train, ferry, taxi and specialist mobility services.", "article": "Activities Check out the range of adrenaline, adventure or relaxing activities in New Zealand.\nCycle Trails The New Zealand Cycle Trail covers the country from head to toe.\nNational Parks New Zealand has 14 National Parks aimed at protecting nature for the future.\nRainbow Tourism Gay marriage has helped pave the way for rainbow tourism in New Zealand.\nMaori Tourism Maori history and culture are part of New Zealand's identity.

This can also be described as making reasonable accommodation.\nPeople with disability are employed across many occupations and like anyone else, they prefer work they are naturally suited to and good at. Some disabilities affect a person\u2019s abilities to perform a particular job, but for most any issues may be overcome by a responsible manager working with the employee or job applicant, eg changing the hours of work slightly is the most common form of reasonable measure.\nEmployers should consider taking reasonable measures to help the job fit the worker and should seek advice if necessary. But first they should talk freely and directly with their employee (or prospective employee) to find out how best to match the person\u2019s abilities to the job for maximum productivity and job satisfaction.\nWhat reasonable accommodation means\nReasonable accommodation is the term used to describe creating an environment intended to ensure equality of opportunity to meet:\nthe particular practices of an employee\u2019s religious or ethical beliefs\nthe employee\u2019s needs in relation to family commitments\nthe employee\u2019s needs in relation to a disability.\nMaking reasonable accommodation enables you to confidently recruit, retain and support disabled people within your organisation.

Once the changes have been made, the workplace is often better placed to do more business, more efficiently, in the future. This in turn boosts the organisation\u2019s disability confidence, competitiveness and inclusiveness of customers and employees.\nMaking changes\nThere might be some things that can be done immediately for little cost, eg rearranging furniture to allow enough room for people in wheelchairs to move through freely or installing a ramp to access premises. A range of workplace adjustment tools are available to improve access to premises. You can discuss ideas with experts, (eg at Workbridge), and use this information as a starting point for discussion with employees.

An action plan identifies ways that you can ensure that your premises, goods, services and facilities are accessible and non-discriminatory to people with disability. Click here for an Australian website to learn how to create a Disability Action Plan (external link) .\nWhat accommodations are reasonable\nYou only have to make accommodations that are reasonable. Factors taken into account when considering what is reasonable are:\nthe effectiveness of the accommodation in helping the employee with disability to perform their job\nwhether it is practical to put in place the accommodation\nthe financial or other costs of the accommodation\nthe extent of available resources, including the organisation\u2019s\nhow much disruption, if any, will be caused to your organisation or other people\nwhether you can get help with the accommodation and its cost eg a modification grant\nthe nature and size of your organisation.\nGeneral reasonable accommodation\nIn some circumstances, it will be appropriate to make changes as a general response to the needs of all disabled people. For example, providing your employees with disability awareness training or when redesigning your website, taking accessibility into account. The advantages of looking at inclusive opportunities include:\nhelping you think of measures that will help many people, including those with disabilities\nsaving money on retrofitting\nenhancing your reputation as a disability-friendly and proactive organisation\nensuring consideration of disability becomes part of your 'business as usual'.\nSpecific reasonable accommodation\nSometimes, you will need to take account of individual needs and make specific changes. Don\u2019t make assumptions about what reasonable accommodations someone needs, always ask them, rather than trying to guess their circumstances and requirements or think you know best. Best practice is to build the question of reasonable measures into your recruitment practices and usual line management processes.\nMost reasonable accommodations don't cost anything but may need a change in attitude or approach. If putting in place a reasonable accommodation does cost money, a modification grant (external link) may be able to help."}, {"title": "Reasonable Accommodation", "article": "Reasonable Accommodation\nA guide to developing policies and procedures to assist disabled people through reasonable accommodation (workplace adjustments). Reasonable accommodation (also known as workplace support or adjustments) is required by many employees not only disabled people. The most common reasonable accommodation for everyone is flexible hours.\nPurpose The purpose of this information is to assist government agencies in developing their reasonable accommodation (workplace adjustments) policies and procedures. Most agencies have policies around worksite assessments and flexible working, but these do not include the full range of workplace accommodations that could be available. It is assumed that all health and safety issues have been addressed, including evacuation procedures and protocols.\nWhat is reasonable accommodation? The United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities defines reasonable accommodation as: the \"necessary and appropriate modification and adjustments not imposing a disproportionate burden, where needed in a particular case, to ensure persons with disabilities the enjoyment or exercise on an equal basis with others of all human rights and fundamental freedoms\". Government agencies provide reasonable accommodation to many employees, such as staff caring for their children or other relatives, staff with religious or ethical beliefs; as well as supporting disabled staff including staff with mental health conditions. These can apply to a current employee whose situation has changed, or for a new employee. There is a requirement for reasonable accommodation to apply across the whole employment continuum, this includes: job advertisements\nthe application processes\nselection interviews\nrecruitment procedures;\non the job training\npromotion\njob protection and termination of employment. top\nWhy provide reasonable accommodations Attract good employees \u2013 tap into the talent pool\nRetain experienced staff\nComply with the Human Rights Act 1993 Government agencies can open up their talent pool of potential employees by being prepared to consider accommodations such as: flexible hours, working from home, job sharing, and providing ergonomic workstations. Providing such accommodations can help government agencies retain an experienced workforce by demonstrating that they value each employee and their ability to contribute and improving the overall morale of the workplace. It has been identified successful managers get the best from their staff when they identify and accommodate what will assist that employee to do the best job possible, whether they have a disability or not. Most accommodations have little or no cost eg flexible working hours, providing instructions in writing, and showing people how to do a task. Providing reasonable accommodations for disabled staff ensures government agencies meet their obligations under the Human Rights Act 1993. Employers must not discriminate against a person because of their disability. We are obligated to reasonably accommodate a person\u2019s disability, including specific services or facilities if needed. top\nWhat is reasonable? The Human Rights Act 1993 doesn\u2019t define what is \"reasonable\", this will depend on the particular circumstances. Factors we should take into account when considering reasonable accommodation include: the activities or business of the organisation\nwhether it is practical to make the adjustment\nthe effectiveness of the adjustment in assisting the employee to perform their job\nthe costs of the adjustments, in relation to the size of the employer\u2019s business\nthe extent of the organisation\u2019s and other resources\nhow employees might be impacted\nhow much disruption, if any, would be caused to the business or other people\nhealth and safety. top\nWhy have written policies and procedures? Awareness\nConsistency\nDocumentation Written policies and procedures can help managers implement reasonable accommodation policies and procedures, make sure that all employees are aware of the policies and procedures, help ensure consistency when processing accommodation requests and provides advice on the how the employers\u2019 efforts to provide effective accommodations are documented. top"}, {"title": "Removing barriers: Reasonable accommodation of disabled people in Aotearoa", "article": "Under the Disability Convention disabled people have the right to reasonable accommodation.

Successful managers will get the best from people, if they are able to identify what will help employees do the best job possible, whether the person has a disability or not.

And these travelers represent, according to the Amadeus Accessibility Study, a \"$70 billion market\" just in Europe and the USA.\nThis fact alone would make a strong business case for investing time, effort, and resources needed to become more accessible and inclusive as a business and as an industry. But beyond the economic imperative, there are important reasons for the tourism industry to take this segment seriously.\nBelow are some ideas and insights on how and why we should promote not just accessibility, but also inclusive tourism that benefits everyone as well as relevant industry resources for tourism businesses and destinations seeking to better understand accessible and inclusive tourism, and to improve their practices. Parts of the content featured here have been inspired by and based on Martin's presentation (originally recorded on July 18th, 2019 as part of the GSTC Sustainable Tourism Training Online Course).\nTourism for All: Including As Many Different Groups As Possible\nContrary to what many might think, accessible tourism is not just about providing facilities that are wheel-chair accessible.\nSenior travelers. Parents traveling with small kids. Travelers with allergies and other medical conditions. These are all different types of travelers who have different degrees of accessibility restrictions and mobility requirements.\nAnd a large proportion of travelers with disabilities have \"invisible\" impairments (such as cognitive or mental health conditions and long-term illnesses) that may not be, unlike wheelchair users, immediately obvious just by looking at them.\nWhen planning for and communicating about the accessibility features and services you provide, therefore, rather than simply using the \"handicap symbol\" (the ubiquitously used sign of a wheelchair user - the top-left pictogram on the above image), these various areas of accessibility needs must be considered and appropriately indicated.\nShare on your website and brochures, for example, if you provide assistive listening devices on your tour, or if sign language interpretation is available within any of the attractions you visit.\n\"Tourism for All\" is a concept that is addressing a growing segment of travelers with a diverse range of needs and requirements. What is \"accessible\" to one traveler who is a wheelchair user, for example, may be very difficult to access or completely inaccessible to another traveler with a different type of disability, mobility impairment or other conditions.\nThat's why becoming more inclusive is a more appropriate goal for the tourism industry than focusing just on \"accessible tourism\" (which can be vague and hard to define - accessible for whom?).\nAn inclusive tourism business or destination works to offer positive travel experiences to people with different needs by addressing them from various perspectives, and by providing design and service solutions that aim to cover as many different groups as possible.\nUniversal Design: Designing for Everyone, Being a Good Host\nWhen it comes to being inclusive and promoting Tourism for All, a key concept that underlies the solutions to be implement by tourism businesses and destinations is Universal Design.\nThe definition of Universal Design is as follows:\nUniversal Design is the design and composition of an environment so that it can be accessed, understood and used to the greatest extent possible by all people regardless of their age, size, ability or disability. An environment (or any building, product, or service in that environment) should be designed to meet the needs of all people who wish to use it. This is not a special requirement, for the benefit of only a minority of the population. It is a fundamental condition of good design. If an environment is accessible, usable, convenient and a pleasure to use, everyone benefits.\n- Centre for Excellence in Universal Design, \" What is Universal Design\nTo understand where you need to improve in order to offer universally accessible experience for everyone's benefit, take some time to reflect on the whole customer journey from the perspectives of guests with different access needs and mobility requirements.\nThink about how they experience travel - from the customer finding your business, to booking their trip, to arriving in your destination, to getting around during their stay.\nAre there steps to enter the restaurant that will make it difficult for customers with limited mobility? Does your hotel offer an accessible and easy-to-follow process for guests with disabilities to check in/out and get around within the property? And is your website designed for users with different needs (e.g. individuals with hearing or vision impairment)?\nBusinesses often have barriers that make it difficult for customers with particular access or mobility impairments to enjoy a certain product or service, because of the lack of awareness that those barriers exist.\nAnd in some cases, businesses may be \"rejecting\" prospective customers without ever knowing. The 2016 Click-Away Pound study found that \"71% of customers with access needs will click away from a website that they find difficult to use\".\nWith all the different types of accessibility requirements, it may seem difficult or impossible to anticipate and accommodate the various needs of your customers. But it's important to remember that in tourism we are in the business of providing services to welcome guests; and that it is in fact your responsibility as a host to cater to the needs of your guests and to make them feel welcome.\nIt's part of being a good host.\nBy considering the diverse needs and abilities of all throughout the design process, universal design creates products, services and environments that meet peoples' needs. Simply put, universal design is good design. - Centre for Excellence in Universal Design, \"What is Universal Design\"\nInclusive Growth and Sustainable Development\nWith the growing importance of the accessible tourism market, and especially the spending power of this market segment including the \"multiplier effect\" (each traveler with impairment is likely to influence the purchase decisions of multiple members of their party), there is a strong economic imperative to be considered. To remain competitive, your tourism business and destination should be investing in universal design and inclusive solutions.\nBeyond the economic imperative, however, there are also key reasons why inclustive tourism should be part of the global sustainable tourism agenda.\nWith an estimated 15% of the world population living with some forms of disabilities (World Health Organization, World Report on Disability 2011), and the changing demographic of the \"rapidly ageing\" populations around the world (WHO, Aging and Life Course), sustainable development can only be achieved through an inclusive approach to creating solutions and opportunities.\nThe United Nations' \"Disability and Development Report: Realizing the Sustainable Development Goals by, for and with persons with disabilities\" (2018) recognizes that \"striving to achieve disability-inclusive development is not only the right thing to do, it is also the practical thing to do,\" as \"the success of the 2030 Agenda requires a participatory and inclusive approach in which all stakeholders, including persons with disabilities, are engaged.\"\nAnd that's why Tourism for All is highlighted in the Global Sustainable Tourism Criteria, the baseline standard for sustainability in travel and tourism.\nSource: Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC)\nAnd in the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO)'s Global Code of Ethics for Tourism.\nSource: UNWTO, Global Code of Ethics for Tourism\nInclusion in the Work Place\nHaving understood the importance of striving for universal design and working towards becoming more inclusive, what can tourism businesses do to get started? What are some of the first steps?\nOne of the key challenges when considering steps to becoming more inclusive is to understand the diverse needs of your customers and your prospective customers. The barriers that prevent some people from having a positive travel experience - whether they may be steps that cannot be climbed, signs that cannot be read, or buttons that cannot be reached - are hard to notice unless you put yourself in the position of those with particular disabilities and impairments.\nOne of the most effective ways for businesses to understand the various accessibility needs of their customers is to have team members who know and represent the perspectives of those customers. In short, hire people with disabilities. Empower them to help make your business more inclusive, both within your operations and through your products and services.\nThe UNWTO report \"Recommendations on Accessible Tourism\" (2013) states that \"the staff of tourism establishments and related services should be prepared to know, understand and address the needs of customers with disabilities\", and \"the staff should include employees who know how to communicate with persons with sensory disabilities.\"\n\"The hospitality industry serves travellers from all over the world. The diversity of cultures implies a diversity of customer expectations as well. The hotels with a diverse workforce to cater to such a wide customer base hold a strong competitive advantage over others. ... [To] have employees that understand the needs and requirements of the customers and provide key insights into making properties progressively accessible is also a crucial element of the overall business strategy.\" - Hospitality Workers Training Centre, \"Disability Inclusion in the Hospitality Industry Makes Business Sense\"\nBusiness Examples: Staff Diversity and Inclusion\nLemon Tree Hotels Limited, India\nWinner of the 2019 Tourism for Tomorrow Awards, in the category \"Investing in People\", Lemon Tree Hotels have focused on creating a socially inclusive work environment, bringing together people of different backgrounds, abilities and ethnicities to work as a unified team with a common goal.

Experiencing a voyage on Tenacious (or her sister ship Lord Nelson) is an object lesson in the benefits of inclusion and accessibility.

Planning a trip can be stressful at the best of times, especially when you or your travel companion has mobility requirements. But don't worry, we are here to make it easier for you and ensure a hassle-free and enjoyable experience for all involved. There is still a lot of uncertainty around travelling with mobility equipment in Australia. We often get asked whether electric mobility aids are allowed when boarding a plane, what the costs involved are and which products are best suited to travel. So allow us to clear things up and give you the top five tips on how to successfully travel by air with mobility aids like electric scooters or wheelchairs: Plane tickets\nAccommodations\nA well-planned itinerary\nSmartphones and camera\nMobility device\n1. Knowledge is Power - know your batteries\nThere are a few different types of batteries that can power electric mobility equipment. The most common ones are gel batteries, lead-acid batteries and lithium batteries. Most portable mobility scooters and powerchairs are powered by non-spillable or lithium-ion batteries to allow for easier lifting and transport.\nAs a rule of thumb, you are able to travel with all different types of batteries listed above, however, the size and the way in which you travel will vary depending on the style of battery and the mobile device you are taking with you. The below information reflects the information from the Qantas Website, extracted on Dec 2020. Please note that this information may be subject to change. To see the latest info please click here.\nFor Lithium Batteries\nLithium batteries must be in their protective cases, with the battery pack or wire harness disconnected from the mobility device and any connectors need to be taped over. The protective case is usually a plastic housing with some handle to help carry the battery.\nAll Lithium batteries sold by Motobility come standard in a protective housing. Including Solax Batteries, Luggie Batteries, SupaScoota Batteries and E-Traveller Batteries.\n160WH +\nAny Lithium Batteries exceeding 160WH (Voltage x Amp-hour = Watt-hours) are prohibited to be transported on an aeroplane and must be sent as dangerous goods freight.\n100WH to 159WH\nA maximum of two spares per passenger are permitted and prior airline approval is required. All battery terminals/connectors must be protected. The battery is required to be taken as Carry-on baggage\nLess than 100WH\nNo prior airline approval is required, all terminals and connectors need to be protected. The batterie/batteries, will be required to be taken as cabin luggage.\nNon-Spillable Batteries (including dry cell, Gel and Lead-Acid)\n12V and 100WHAny Batteries exceeding 12V and 100WH (Voltage x Amp-hour = Watt-hours) are prohibited to be transported on the plane and require to be sent as dangerous goods freight. Not exceeding 12V and 100WhThese batteries need to be carried as carry-on luggage and passengers are limited to two spares per passenger. Prior Airline approval is required.\n2. Communication is key - communicate with your airline and/or travel agent\nAccording to Qantas, the largest airline company in Australia, if you need wheelchair assistance or you are travelling with your own mobility aid, once you\u2019ve booked your flight you can send a request online. Provide your booking reference number along with these details:\nA) Type of Mobility Aid (manual or battery-powered)\nB) if motorised the battery type: Nickel Hydride, lithium-ion or non-spillable\nC) Mobility aid brand and model\nD) the dimensions (in its most compact state) and the weight, height, length and width of the mobility aid.\nFor more information about mobility aid assistance, visit the website of your airline or call their hotline or speak to your travel agent ahead about your needs.\n3. Be Prepared - carry your user manual and MSDS Certificate\nYour mobility aids like the electric scooter and wheelchairs are delicate items and therefore must be handled properly. Always bring with you the user manual and/or the battery information so that airline employees assisting you may know how to handle your mobility equipment with care.\n4. Prevention is better than a cure - Invest in a sturdy carry case\nAs mentioned in bullet number three, mobility scooters and wheelchairs are fragile and must be handled with care. Take extra precaution since when you fly, not all the time that you have your eyes on your precious mobility aids or some handlers may be a bit careless so better have a sturdy carry case that protects your scooter or wheelchair. The carry case must have the following: Hard outer layer Wheeled for easy mobility Padded inside for extra protection Lockable for extra peace of mind\n5. Expect the Unexpected - be prepared for emergencies\nAlways be prepared for emergencies so always have spare keys, spare batteries and some accessories https://www.motobility.com.au/products/electric-mobility-scooters or https://www.motobility.com.au/products/electric-wheelchairs-powerchairs/wheelchair-accessories> in tow. More than that, make sure that your mobility equipment is insured!\nMore Tips:\n1. When bringing your mobility equipment, keep in mind that it\u2019s FREE of charge!\n2. Make sure that your scooter supplier provided you with a verification of compliance certificate for your battery as some airlines might require this. Always keep this document handy, so you\u2019ll have a hassle-free journey!\n3. It is always a good practice to research about your destination, especially when you\u2019re touring with someone with mobility needs. Please bear in mind that rules may vary when travelling in different countries, so always call ahead to double-check!"}, {"title": "Travelling with Disabilities", "article": "Wheelchairs and other mobility aids\nWhile smaller mobility aids such as canes, crutches and collapsible walking frames can easily be stowed in the aircraft cabin, wheelchairs and motorised scooters can be a different story. As there is limited room for larger mobility equipment in the cabin (usually only one or two are accepted), airlines offer the option of checking your wheelchair in with your baggage and using an airport wheelchair, or taking your own chair all the way to boarding where it will then be stowed in the aircraft hold to be collected upon arrival.\nAirport wheelchairs are subject to availability, so it\u2019s essential you get in early and make your special assistance details known. For motorised mobility aids, you must ensure all batteries are disconnected and that the connections are taped and covered so they do not turn on during the flight or run the risk of short circuiting.\nIt is important to give as much information about the type of equipment you have when making your booking, so you don\u2019t run into issues with security or during the boarding process. Don\u2019t forget to label your wheelchair or mobility equipment before you travel.\nWhen booking your accommodation or if you\u2019re considering a cruise, contact the company well in advance to see whether you can secure a ground-level room, discuss the availability of elevators or ramps and whether there is suitable access in and out of dining or entertainment areas.\nTravelling with assistance dogs\nDifferent airlines have individual protocols when it comes to travelling with assistance dogs: some allow the dogs to remain on board, while others require them to be placed in a secure pet container in the hold.\nAssistance dogs must fulfil a checklist to be accepted on board, including having met an appropriate level of training, certification from an industry recognised organisation and passing a public access test in the case of guide dogs. Handlers should have a laminated identification card with their name and their companion\u2019s name printed on it ready to show to staff on request.\nRegistered service dogs can often accompany you on board on domestic flights and select international flights, but it\u2019s important to check whether your flight route is assistance dog approved.\nTo avoid difficulties when it comes to quarantine, make sure your canine companion has met the specifications on the quarantine appropriate website (e.g. AQIS for Australia and DEFRA for the United Kingdom) and that you have any and all relevant documentation with you including vaccinations, treatments and micro-chipping.\nYour dog\u2019s safety harness may be required during take-off, landing or any time the \"fasten seat belt\" sign is turned on. Finally, make sure your assistance dog has access to water both before and during the journey.\nTips for travelling with medication\nMisplaced baggage is stressful enough, but the situation can be made even worse if you have essential medication stowed in your checked luggage. Avoid this worst case scenario by making sure any medication you will need is taken in your hand luggage, including extra prescriptions and letters from your doctor.\nAdditionally, if your medication needs to be kept at a certain temperature, pack it in a cooler bag to be taken on board. Do not remove your medication from their packaging \u2013 it\u2019s best to take it in its box with pharmaceutical labels visible.\nAt times, you may be required to complete a medical clearance form prior to flying, especially if you suffer from a condition that could be impacted by pressurised cabins. Those who require medication to be administered via syringe can usually take medical sharps on board with minimal complications, but you may need to present a letter from your doctor, a prescription or the medication itself with the pharmacy label displaying your name.\nBe mindful that while cabin and ground staff at the airport or cruise terminal are ready to assist you wherever possible, they do not undertake specialist medical training. If you need to administer medication during your journey, talk to your GP beforehand and make sure your carer is adequately prepared.\nTravel Tip: Important medication and documents relating to your health should always be taken as carry-on baggage.\nCheck in early and travel with ease\nChecking in as early as possible will alleviate any potential hiccups along the way. If there is a service desk inside the terminal, staff may be able to assist you with checking in, which should be at least 60 minutes before a domestic flight and two hours for international travel.\nPassengers with visual or hearing impairments will find hearing assistant \u201cloops\u201d and tactile (including Braille) signage at most major airport terminals.\nAt security, advise the screening officers of any medical implants (such as pacemakers or hearing aids) or prosthetic limbs, as a physical pat-down may be opted for as opposed to X-Ray. Above all else, ensure you or your carer has any documentation related to your disability on hand at all times.\nPriority check-in and boarding for special needs guests\nPassengers requiring special assistance are invited to board first on most flights, so you will have plenty of time to get settled before take-off. It\u2019s likely you will be given priority at every stage, from the check-in kiosk to security and bypassing lengthy customs and immigration lines. Additionally, airlines don\u2019t usually charge excess baggage fees for checking in mobility equipment.\nWhat to expect on-board\nIf you require a little extra legroom or would like to be close to the lavatory, most airlines will reserve your preferred seat at no extra charge. Seats vary from being more spacious to having movable arm rests, however exit row seating is not an option due to safety restrictions.\nDisability appropriate seating is usually found at the entry points of the aircraft, at the beginning of a cabin class, or an aisle seat with adjustable arm rests. Choosing your seat prior to check-in ensures extra peace of mind, and staff can make arrangements for your carer or assistance dog to be within easy reach.\nExtra assistance for immobile guests\nIf you are unable to manoeuvre yourself into your seat, trained flight attends may be able to assist you with the use of a slide board. To discuss what seating options might best suit your needs, get in touch with your Flight Centre travel consultant or the dedicated Special Assistance team of the airline you are flying with. You should also keep in mind not all planes have disabled toilets \u2013 an important consideration if you\u2019re travelling long-haul.\nDisability-friendly tours\nIt\u2019s important to do your research before heading off on holiday when it comes to things to do, such as the easy \u201chop-on hop-off\u201d busses. These days, there are more and more dedicated tour groups specialising in disability friendly holidays and key tourism sites accessible for every traveller.\nGet in touch with Flight Centre\u2019s tour group specialists to discuss what options might best suit your taste for travel: whether you\u2019re looking to set sail on a cruise or strap yourself in for bungee jumping, there are guided tours out there with experts on hand to get you to destinations you never thought possible.\nFurthermore, it\u2019s common to receive discounts for both you and your carer at major attractions. To avoid the discomfort of waiting in line, take your mobility parking sticker (recognised almost everywhere) and jump the queue.\nEssential travel insurance\nDisability travel insurance can be a tricky thing to figure out, but luckily there are consultants on standby specialising in just that. Some insurance providers have plans in place for holidaymakers with pre-existing conditions, so there\u2019s one less thing you will have to worry.\nSome travel insurance can even cover your mobility equipment if something happens to it, compensate replacement medication and take care of medical expenses incurred on your break. It can be much easier to get travel insurance than you might think and it\u2019s worth the up-front costs if something should happen while you\u2019re away.\nRegardless of age, ability or any other factor, contact Flight Centre\u2019s travel insurance specialists today and for peace of mind knowing you\u2019re protected away from home."}]
