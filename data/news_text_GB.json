Ask them to send you pictures of the room and bathroom to see if it will work for you before you book.\nTransport and sightseeing Researching the area where you\u2019ll be staying is a more exciting part of planning. Discover what there is to do and how you can get around. Getting around Check public transport options to see if they\u2019re accessible to you. If they are not suitable, your hotel or host may be able to help you arrange a private car or taxi service. If you can, save numbers for taxi firms that can provide accessible vehicles in advance, so you have them ready for when you need them. Attractions Research attractions and activities in the area like places to eat and drink, museums, galleries, historic sites and beaches. Check their websites to find access information. Use Google Street View to see how accessible they are for you.

Try to keep some with you in case your luggage gets lost. You may also want to: share your itinerary with family and friends so they know where you\u2019re going\nget contact details for emergency services like the ambulance and police\nkeep family contact details and your health information in your bag or wallet\ncomplete the medical ID information on your phone\nWarning Explaining your condition abroad Find words and phrases related to your condition in the local language.

If you are not satisfied with the response, you can then contact the independent Rail Ombudsman. The Rail Ombudsman was established by industry to investigate and rule on unresolved customer complaints, with the power to issue decisions that are binding on the industry.\nORR is responsible for monitoring train operating companies\u2019 compliance with their ATP obligations.\nCars\nIf you are driving and you have a medical condition or disability, you must inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency ( DVLA ).\nInformation on:\nThe Motability Scheme: If you are in receipt of a qualifying benefit then you can elect to join \u2018The Motability Scheme\u2019. The scheme can help you with leasing a:\ncar\npowered wheelchair\nscooter\nThe Department for Work and Pensions ( DWP ) is responsible for the disability benefits that provide a passport to the scheme. While DWP works closely with Motability, it is an independent charitable organisation that is wholly responsible for the terms and the administration of the scheme itself. Therefore all questions should be addressed to Motability.\nCar complaints and enforcement process\nMotability Scheme: Complaints can be registered directly with The Motability Scheme via a complaints form, telephone, and email or by post.

Only the Courts can determine definitively what action constitutes a \u201creasonable adjustment\u201d. In January 2017 the Supreme Court clarified the law as it affects access to the wheelchair space for wheelchair users, ruling that drivers must do more than simply request other passengers vacate the space when it is required by a wheelchair user.\nBus and coach complaints and enforcement process\nPhysical accessibility: Responsibility for enforcing compliance with PSVAR rests with the Driver and Vehicles Standards Agency ( DVSA ) and the Office of the Traffic Commissioner ( OTC ). Passengers who believe a bus or coach which is subject to PSVAR , does not comply with its requirements, should report their concerns to DVSA for further investigation.\nDriver responsibilities: When passengers feel that assistance which is required by the Conduct Regulations or which might constitute a reasonable adjustment, has not been provided by a bus or coach driver we would encourage them, in the first instance, to complain directly to the service operator concerned.

The findings will form a new public database so people can better plan their journeys and, along with input from disabled passengers, will shape future investment in accessible rail travel.\nDfT will also work with Network Rail to improve safety with a new programme to install all station platforms with tactile paving. This comes on top of work to develop a Passenger Assist App to simplify communication with rail staff and encourage better customer service.\nThe government will bring forward new regulations to force bus companies to provide audible and visual announcements onboard services. To help smaller companies achieve this, government grants will be boosted to \u00a33.5 million. New research into the designs of bus stops and stations will ensure they are accessible for all.\nDfT will also support new legislation for taxis and private hire vehicles, protecting disabled passengers from being overcharged and to better ensure they get the right help from drivers.\nAccessibility Minister Chris Heaton-Harris said:\nDisabled passengers should be empowered to use all forms of transport with the same confidence as everyone else \u2013 whether by taxi, train, bus or ferry. Today\u2019s measures will have a positive, real-life impact and double-down on our promise to build back fairer from COVID-19.\nThere is also a boost to seaports, with new \u00a31 million funding to improve access at ports to the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly.\nIn addition, DfT will work with consumer groups to design more accessible chargepoints for electric vehicles, as the industry steers away from fuel-burning cars.\nAlongside local authorities, DfT will work to reduce parking on pavements to declutter our streets and free up paths, so vulnerable pedestrians can make journeys more safely and easily. An announcement on next steps will be made later this year.\nAnd for longer journeys, new \u00a3450,000 funding will help deliver more accessible toilets, through the Changing Places programme, on top of the \u00a32.2 million already invested, to ensure most motorway services have the right facilities for the quarter of a million people who cannot use standard accessible ones.\nAnthony Smith, Chief Executive of the independent watchdog Transport Focus, said:\nIt\u2019s important that transport operators seek the views of disabled people to make sure services better suit their needs as the country recovers from the pandemic. These measures will help remove barriers and improve access for all transport users.\nRobert Burley, Director of Campaigns, Care and Support at Muscular Dystrophy UK , said:\nWe regularly hear from people living with muscle-wasting conditions who have had to cancel or cut short days out or don\u2019t consider them at all, because of poor accessibility. The strategy announced today is a step in the right direction to helping tackle the exclusion that so many disabled people face on a daily basis.\nThe measures are part of the government\u2019s National Disability Strategy \u2013 the most ambitious endeavour to remove barriers to disabled people\u2019s everyday lives.

Laid out along the classic grid system, generally flat and with a fully accessible trolley system, it also boasts a balmy year-round 64-80\u00b0F climate.\nThe historic Gaslamp Quarter is very wheelchair friendly, as is the massive Balboa Park (incorporating the slightly hilly San Diego Zoo), but it\u2019s the miles of beachfront promenade with beach wheelchairs available \u2013 including a motorized one with caterpillar tracks at Mission Beach! \u2013 that are the main attraction.\nBarcelona, Spain\nWith the national tourism authority and Catalonia in particular pushing accessible travel, it\u2019s no surprise that wheelchair users have been flocking to Barcelona. With 80% of the metro stations and 100% of buses wheelchair-accessible, as well as a relatively flat and cobblestone-free old city, getting around is a breeze.\nWhat\u2019s more, wheelchair users not only jump to the front of the queue for attractions such as the breathtaking Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, they often get in for free! You can explore the length of La Rambla and get around the famous Mercat de la Boqueria; even the beach has wheelchair access and people on hand to help.\nWelcome to Las Vegas \u00a9 Michael Phillips / Getty Images\nLas Vegas, Nevada, USA\nLas Vegas is undoubtedly one of the most accessible cities for people with disabilities in the US. Of course, the casinos and the venues hosting world-renowned musicians and shows are all wheelchair accessible, as are the vast majority of sites and attractions, many of which \u2013 like the Fountains of Bellagio and the Fremont Street Experience \u2013 are completely free.\nMore surprising, perhaps, the High Roller \u2013 the tallest observation wheel in the world, which takes 30 minutes to do a full revolution \u2013 is also wheelchair-accessible. And if you\u2019re after an adrenaline rush, wheelchair users can even enjoy the SlotZilla Zip Line and the Zoomline, which reach speeds of up to 35 miles an hour, or a hot-air balloon ride over the city.\nAdd to this a very wide choice in accessible accommodation, easy exploration along the wide sidewalks of the Strip, a fully accessible bus service that serves all parts of the city, and plenty of wheelchair-accessible taxis and you can begin to understand why Las Vegas has become something of a destination for wheelchair users.\nManchester, UK\nAlthough it was the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, much of central Manchester was rebuilt in the late 1990s, making smooth, wide, step-free pavements, as well as stepless entry into shops, restaurants and bars the norm \u2013 ideal for anyone with mobility requirements.\nNorthern England\u2019s cultural hub is well served by accessible public transport, leaving you free to pay homage at Old Trafford, learn about our industrial roots at the Museum of Science and Industry or shop with the goths at Affleck\u2019s. And if you\u2019ve had enough of the city, the Peak District National Park, with well-developed facilities for visitors with disabilities, is less than an hour away.\nA piazza in Taormina, Sicily \u00a9 Matt Munro / Lonely Planet\nSicily, Italy\nItaly might not spring to mind as a very accessible destination due to its narrow, often cobblestone streets. But there are a number of tour operators that cater to travelers with disabilities. Motor-impaired travelers can enjoy scuba diving, 4WD off-road driving, traditional Sicilian fishing and olive oil making \u2013 not to mention the gastronomic delights normally associated with Italy. Indeed, two Guinness world records have been set here: first paraplegic to dive to 59m and first blind woman to dive to 41m!\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania, USA\nAs one of the oldest cities in the US, you might not expect Philadelphia to be very accessible \u2013 but it is! While the Old Town may offer some challenges for wheelchair users, sidewalks are generally well maintained in the more touristed areas, with plenty of curb cuts and tactile markings.\nThis is particularly useful for wheelchair users considering most of the city\u2019s attractions are within a two-mile radius of the City Hall. The subway, opened in 1907, is only partially wheelchair-accessible, as is the overland rail network, but unfortunately the aging trolley system is not. However, the city\u2019s fleet of more than 1000 buses are all low-floor and wheelchair-accessible, as is the PHLASH tourist bus which runs a continuous loop downtown, stopping at many popular attractions, and costs only $5 for an all-day pass.\nNeedless to say, all of the city\u2019s most popular attractions \u2013 including Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell, Love Park and the Philadelphia Museum of Art \u2013 are fully wheelchair-accessible despite their antiquity. And when it comes to finding accommodations, there are plenty of wheelchair-friendly options right in the center of the action.\nSandridge Bridge in Melbourne, Australia \u00a9 Catherine Sutherland / Lonely Planet\nMelbourne, Australia\nWith its highly accessible public transport system and compact city center, Melbourne is one of the most accessible cities in the world. Visit the sporting capital of Australia armed with Lonely Planet\u2019s accessibility guide, Accessible Melbourne, a free e-book that includes the most up-to-date advice for travelers with special needs. Discover Melbourne\u2019s best wheelchair-friendly restaurants, enjoy spectacular scenery along the Great Ocean Road, and visit one of the world\u2019s best zoos as well as many of the parks that progressive Parks Victoria is opening up to visitors with access needs.\nLjubljana, Slovenia\nSlovenia\u2019s flat and largely pedestrianized capital, served by accessible electric vehicles, is well worth a visit. Most of its buses are accessible, but the city is so small, with plenty of ramps and curb cuts, you might rarely need them.\nThe city\u2019s main drawcard, the 16th-century Ljubljana Castle is reached via a funicular (free for people with disabilities and a companion) or train, both wheelchair-accessible. Many of Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik\u2019s famous bridges have recently been made accessible, and were joined in 2010 by the award-winning Butchers\u2019 Bridge, which allows wheelchair users access to boats.\nSingapore has established accessibility requirements into its city code \u00a9 Ninnat Fongsupa / 500px\nSingapore\nSingapore has to be the most accessible city in Asia and one of the most accessible cities in the world. Its universal code on barrier-free accessibility, in place for decades, plus increasing affluence have resulted in an infrastructure with stepless access to most buildings and no shortage of curb cuts.\nAlthough power wheelchair-friendly taxis aren\u2019t common, the accessibility of the mass rail transit (MRT) and buses makes them unnecessary. In Singapore, the question is not \u201cwhat is accessible?\u201d but rather \u201cwhat isn\u2019t?\u201d \u2013 from its street food hawker centers to its marvelous zoo.\nVienna, Austria\nLike many European cities, Vienna is steeped in history, being the center of the former Habsburg Empire and the musical heart of Europe. Unlike many of its counterparts, however, its cobblestones have been removed, as have many of the curbs.\nThe refurbished city is both flat and compact, with most central shops and cafes fully accessible. Getting around is relatively easy with elevators to the metro and plenty of low-floor trams. Most museums and places of interest are fully accessible, including the must-see Schloss Sch\u00f6nbrunn.\nYou might also like:\nTake a spin around the globe with an accessible travel expert\nWhat I have learned from travelling the world with a wheelchair"}, {"title": "Air travel for disabled people", "article": "Air travel for disabled passengers Before booking travel, check the latest Government advice. Foreign travel advice (GOV.UK)\nWarning Book assistance in advance You must book special assistance at least 48 hours before your flight to make sure that the airline can meet your needs.\nAre you fit to fly? The airline may ask for information about your condition or impairment to make sure that you're fit to fly. You are usually the best judge of this but speak with your GP or consultant if you're unsure. Buy travel insurance as soon as you book your trip so that you're covered if anything happens before you go. Let the airline know as soon as possible if you feel that you're not fit to fly after booking a flight.\nWhat support and facilities are available? Most airports and airlines offer support and facilities for disabled passengers, including: accessible toilets and changing rooms at airports\nbuggies and hover buses to help you get across the airport and to your gate\nrooms or lounges that can be quieter for people with anxiety and sensory issues\npagers that let you know when you can board your flight\nSunflower lanyards that let airport staff know you have a less visible condition or impairment Different staff may support you at different points in the airport. See what's available at your airport and airline (Civil Aviation Authority)\nWhat equipment can you take? Think about the equipment you use every day, like a wheelchair or toilet seat, and check if you can take it on the plane. As well as your luggage allowance, you should be able to take 2 pieces of disability equipment free of charge. You will need to give details about your equipment's weight and size and a manual for your wheelchair when you book special assistance. Transport support services for disabled people: Planes (GOV.UK)\nWhat would make your flight more comfortable? Seating and toilets are often narrow on planes. Ask the airline: how they store equipment like crutches on the flight\nif they can provide extra pillows and blankets if you need them Tryb4uFly can help you work out what you need and loan equipment to make your journey easier. Book a cabin assessment (Tryb4uFly) If you\u2019re feeling anxious about flying, think about loading mindfulness apps or gentle music onto your phone or tablet. You could also take an eye mask and ear plugs, or noise-cancelling headphones, to reduce overstimulation.\nWill you need medication? Plan medication for your trip at least 4 weeks before you travel. Check online or with your GP if you can take your medication into the country you're visiting. You may need to bring a copy of your prescription and a letter from your doctor. Your doctor may charge for this. Ask your airline about restrictions for medication too. You may be able to take only 100ml of liquid medication in your hand luggage. It can be a good idea to take twice the amount of medication you need. Split this into 2 separate bags in case some is lost. Can I take my medicine abroad? (NHS)\nWho are you travelling with? If you're flying with a personal assistant (PA) or carer, you need to consider the cost of their air ticket. Check the airport and airline policies if you're travelling alone. Some airlines insist you travel with a companion if you are not able to travel on your own. This is because cabin staff are limited in how they can help you.\nWarning Flying with an assistance dog You have the right to fly with an assistance dog, but you must follow the rules on pet travel. Check the rules for the country you're travelling to. Taking your pet abroad (GOV.UK)\nPreparing for your journey Booking special assistance When you book your flight, you will be asked if you're a 'passenger with reduced mobility (PRM)' and need 'special assistance'. Check this box and select what support you need before, during and after your flight. This includes things like pagers to alert you when you're boarding and help with directions in the airport. The airline may call or email you for more information, such as: details about your condition or impairment\nthe brand, model and dimensions of equipment you want to take on the plane\na manual for your wheelchair Use the airline app or save and print out all your booking confirmation, including: your booking number\nspecial assistance you've agreed\ntransport and parking\nluggage and equipment Save contact numbers on your phone, like your airline helpline and special assistance desk. Printing a map of the car park and airport can be helpful too. Getting to the airport Plan how you'll get to the airport and give yourself plenty of time. If you're taking public transport, you may want to try your route before. Check how close you can park to the entrance if you're driving and if there's a time limit. Some airports offer a valet service where someone will meet you at the entrance and park your car for you. It's a good idea to contact them before if you have an adapted vehicle. Finding your booked assistance Find the special assistance desk as soon as you arrive at the airport. They can help you check in luggage and make sure you have the support you need to get to your flight. It can help to have a letter explaining your condition and the support you need to give to the staff. Going through check-in and security When checking in your luggage and equipment, you may need to take it to a different desk for oversized baggage. Any equipment that stays with you will need a sticker or tag to show it's been checked in. Security can be busy, but there is usually a separate lane for disabled passengers. Common security measures include: a scanner which may affect things like hearing aids\nbeing 'patted down' to check you for items that are not allowed\nswabbing or wiping your clothing, shoes or equipment to check for unauthorised substances\nscanning your shoes and mobility equipment You may be asked for the same information at different points in the airport. This can be frustrating. But it's the staff's job to make sure you have the support you need.\nWarning If you feel uncomfortable in security Let the staff know if you want to be patted down privately or away from the queue.\nBoarding the plane You may have to travel some distance across the airport to reach your boarding gate. Most airports have maps on their website so you can check your route. Depending on the distance, you may want to book a buggy or borrow an airport wheelchair to help you. From the gate, there are different ways of boarding the plane. You may need to take a shuttle bus to reach it. These can be crowded. If you feel anxious about this, ask if there's another way of getting to the plane. There will be equipment to help you board the plane, such as: a ramp, sometimes called an aviramp\na lift, sometimes called an ambulift\na narrower transfer wheelchair\na portable hoist called an Eagle Lifter Staff can help you move into a transfer chair if you use a wheelchair. Talk with them first to give clear instructions on how they should help you. Your wheelchair will be put in the hold with other luggage.\nWarning Be clear what you need staff to do Ask staff to stop if you feel uncomfortable about something or at risk of injury. Help them work out how they can support you better or ask for someone else to help you.\nArriving at your destination The special assistance you book also includes support on your arrival. You will usually have to wait for other passengers to leave the plane before staff help you. You may have new staff members to help you when you arrive. You can ask for staff to bring your mobility equipment to the aircraft door. If you do not, it will usually be at the oversized baggage reclaim point.\nWarning Explaining your condition abroad Find words and phrases related to your condition or have a letter prepared in the local language. For example, you may need to explain what support you need to staff at your destination. Download the free Accessible Travel Phrasebook (Lonely Planet)\nTravel checklist Check the status of your flight before you leave home and make sure that you have: your passport and any other travel documents needed\nall booking confirmation\nairport and car park maps\ntravel insurance details\nmedication and doctor's letters\nmanuals for your wheelchair\nphone numbers for your airline and special assistance desk\nshoes that are easy to take on and off for security\napps or music to help with anxiety\na phrasebook or letter explaining your condition in the local language"}, {"title": "Disability and travel abroad", "article": "1. Overview\nFor some people with disabilities, overseas travel can present challenges, as accessibility standards and facilities can be different to the UK. This Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) guide is intended to provide useful information to help you plan for travel. It also includes emergency contact information and lets you know how to contact the nearest British embassy, high commission or consulate if you need help when overseas.\n2.

Double-check all arrangements before departure.\nIf relevant, confirm your preferred means of communication with the travel organiser, for example information in large print or Braille.\n3. Health and medication\nIf you are travelling in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, check for the latest information on the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) online or by phone on 0300 330 1350.\nMost people with disabilities do not need to get medical clearance before travelling. However, some airlines may ask for evidence of fitness to travel.\nIt may be useful to carry a \u2018travelling letter\u2019, which gives a brief description of your disability or impairment and, if relevant, details of any difficulties that could occur and the assistance you might need.\nIf flying, ask your doctor if your disability or impairment makes you vulnerable to issues such as circulation problems.\nIf you have a medical condition, some airlines may require you and your doctor to complete a Medical Information Form (MEDIF). The form is usually only valid for one trip and the flights and dates shown on your ticket.\nFrequent travellers may be able to obtain a Frequent Travellers Medical Card (FREMEC), which gives the airline a permanent record of your specific needs, so that you do not have to fill in a form and make arrangements every time you travel.\nIf you take medication:\ncheck with your airline provider what documentation you should take with you to prove the need to carry medication and in what receptacles it should be carried\nyou may need a letter from your doctor stating your need for the medication in case you need to get more when travelling, and particularly if you are going to a country with strict drug controls. Carry the letter with you so you can show it to customs officers\nensure you take enough medication with you to see you through the trip and allow for possible delays. Always keep clearly labelled medication and any medical documents in your hand luggage or in a place you can get to them easily.\nyour medication may contain ingredients that are illegal in some countries. Find out more information on travelling with medicine containing a controlled drug. Before you travel, check with the embassy of the country you will visit .\n4. Reduced mobility: your rights\nThink about the facilities or support you will need. Make sure you give the carrier and travel provider all the relevant details of your requirements at all stages of the journey.\nThere are specific rights for people with disabilities and reduced mobility, if you are travelling from the UK or the European Union. Under Regulation EC 1107/2006:\nairlines and tour operators may not refuse to take bookings or carry passengers on the basis of reduced mobility\na reservation or boarding can only be refused for justified safety reasons or if the boarding or transport of a person with a disability or reduced mobility is physically impossible, due to the size of the aircraft or its doors\nif a reservation is refused, an acceptable alternative must be offered. If boarding is refused, the person must be offered reimbursement or re-routing\nairport authorities are obliged to provide assistance without extra cost to the person concerned, though it may levy a charge on all passengers\nthe airport authority is responsible for ensuring that the passenger receives the necessary assistance from designated points of arrival at the airport to the point of boarding the aircraft\non flights from EU airports, airlines are obliged to provide certain services, such as the carrying of wheelchairs or guide dogs, free of charge\nairport authorities and airlines have to provide training to their staff so that those providing direct assistance to people with disabilities and reduced mobility know how to meet their needs\nall staff working at the airport should be provided with disability equality and awareness training\n5. Transport\nConsider your needs during all parts of the journey, including at departure, while onboard, at stopovers, during transfer journeys and at the destination.\nConsider pre-booking your seat \u2013 different transport carriers have different policies so check the terms of any pre-booking. If relevant, find out about toilet accessibility and any special dietary requirements.\nCheck what assistance is available at check-in, moving around the terminal, for boarding and disembarking. The Civil Aviation Authority has information on special assistance at UK airports.\n6. Travelling with wheelchairs and other equipment\nCheck the policy on taking any equipment you may need such as wheelchairs, portable machines, batteries, respirators or oxygen. Some airlines will not take certain types of batteries such as wet cell batteries or oxygen cylinders. You may need to follow packing procedures, you may be asked about the make and type of your equipment, and there may be forms to complete.\nWheelchair users are usually boarded on planes first, so arrive in good time. Whatever your needs, if you think you require additional time to make yourself comfortable, ask to be pre-boarded.\nWheelchair users often disembark planes last on arrival.\nWheelchair users will usually be asked to transfer to another chair so that their own wheelchair can be loaded onto the plane.\nIf your wheelchair is anything other than a standard specification, make sure you ask the crew for it to be made available at the door on arrival - the airline may otherwise choose to meet you with one of the airport operator\u2019s wheelchairs.\nTo avoid loss or damage, remove seat cushions and any other parts that could easily become separated from the chair, and take these items with you.\nAttach instructions to scooters or power chairs, saying how and where to disconnect the batteries, and any other assembly or transportation instructions that might be necessary. This is important because, even if you give handlers instructions at the start of your journey, you may not be able to do the same with the handlers when you arrive.\n7. Assistance and guide dogs\nIf you have an assistance or guide dog, contact the airline as soon as possible, and check their policy on travelling with an assistance or guide dog.\nConfirm if any veterinary certificates and identification are required, and the procedure for carriage of the dog.\nCheck if your dog will be subject to quarantine regulations.\nCheck with your accommodation if there are facilities for your dog.\nFind more information on travelling with an assistance or guide dog.\n8. Accommodation\nBe specific about your requirements \u2013 ask for whatever you need to make your stay comfortable and ask for written confirmation that they are available.\nIf you use a travel agent or tour operator, they should be able to advise you, but you may also want to contact the hotel, resort or cruise liner directly to confirm specific details.\n9. Mobility needs, wheelchairs and other equipment at your destination\nIf you have mobility needs, check on the access to rooms, restaurants, bars, toilets, swimming pool, the beach etc.\nCheck if a lift is available, and if relevant, whether your wheelchair or other equipment will fit. If you prefer, check if you can be on the ground floor or near a suitable lift.\nIf you use a wheelchair, check if there is step-free access to all the main areas of the hotel, resort or cruise ship.\nCheck if the bedroom and bathroom facilities are going to fit your needs. If relevant, ask how wide the door is, whether it opens outwards or inwards, how large the bathroom is, and if there is a roll-in shower or grab-bars.\nIf you use an electric wheelchair, check if there are charging facilities.\nRemember to take with you any necessary equipment such as spare inner tubes and tools, a voltage converter (check the voltage before you travel), an adaptor plug and transformer.\nAsk if you can hire any equipment you need, such as back rests, bathing equipment, hoists, ramps and special mattresses. Information may be available from local disability organisations at your destination.\n10. Car use\nIf you intend to take or hire a car, the Blue Badge Scheme operates in other countries, including throughout the European Union. Adapted cars are available for hire in many countries. Make sure you know the licence requirements, driving laws and driving conditions of the country you are visiting.\nWhen hiring a car, make sure the company is fully aware of your needs and check the level of insurance they offer \u2013 you may decide to extend the insurance.\nIf you need a taxi, try to book one in advance and state your needs. Be aware that, in many places, accessible vehicles may not be available.\n11. How the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) can help\nIf you get into difficulty overseas, you can contact the nearest British embassy, high commission or consulate, or the FCDO in London on 020 7008 5000.\nThe FCDO can:\noffer general travel information\nhelp you to contact a local doctor if you need medical treatment\nprovide information about translation and interpretation services\nprovide a list of overseas lawyers who speak English\nhelp you contact the relevant local authorities and organisations when you are overseas\ncontact your relatives and friends and let them know if something has happened to you\ngive you advice on your options if you need financial help\nwhere appropriate, issue travel documents\nFind more information on the FCDO\u2019s support for British nationals abroad.\nFCDO Travel Advice pages contain the contact details for the emergency services in most countries.

My love affair with air travel has become more strained since 2005, however, when I collapsed with brain damage that left me disabled. I\u2019ve also since adopted two children who are disabled and found that travel for us as a family today can sometimes feel like we\u2019re in the realm of a project that Nasa would be impressed by.\nProfessionally, these experiences have also led me to launch my own people development consultancy, Delsion, and support organisations in all sectors to create more inclusive experiences for the people they provide services to, and who are in their employment too. So, before we look at what could be done better, I first want to say that I have also seen first-hand how a lot of travel professionals do go that extra mile to create inclusive and accessible experiences from start to finish.\nBut having made the transition from someone who travelled extensively with the need of minimal planning and forethought to a disabled traveller with disabled dependants in my care too, for me there is still much to be done if we are to make travel a truly inclusive experience for all \u2013 there are still too many questions tourism operators may have neglected to ask themselves? So, what are they?\nHow many disabled passengers are travelling with you?\nI would be genuinely interested to see how much of an understanding even major travel industry operators have around the numbers of disabled passengers, and the breadth of specific needs they cater for on an annual basis, for example. Based on my experiences as a disabled traveller, a lot of major airlines, theme parks and other mainstream names in the tourism world are still failing to truly consider the position of the disabled traveller or display any kind of joined up thinking when it comes to supporting that person to complete their journey smoothly, from the time they leave their house to the moment they put their key back in the front door.\nThere are still so many issues we encounter on every trip, including being stuck on a plane for over an hour when there were no facilities provided to help us disembark, for instance. Are incidents like this (which continue to be reported in the mainstream media on a regular basis) still happening because travel companies on the whole still view disabled passengers as a very minor segment of their customer base?\nBecause if they don\u2019t have a true understanding of the numbers and needs of disabled passengers that travel with them, and they don\u2019t truly value their custom, then it\u2019s likely these same organisations aren\u2019t prioritising the formation of wider strategies which can help effect inclusive experiences. And without strategies in place, how is everyone (or anyone) within that organisation expected to understand or contribute to what a company might be trying to achieve in terms of supporting customers who sit outside that \u2018unconscious traveller\u2019 bracket?\nDo all of your teams have the knowledge, empathy and engagement to support inclusive travel?\nDo you understand the impact that individuals and teams can have on creating accessible and inclusive environments, rather than just relying on processes? From a previous career I had in retail, I can tell you that everyone in an organisation is and should be responsible for customer service \u2013 and this shouldn\u2019t be any different for disabled travellers. There are still massive issues with the time it takes to access the right person and pass on the information required as a disabled passenger, for example, that you can genuinely lose days in planning a trip.\nIt\u2019s not enough to simply rely on a specialist team or \u2018department\u2019 dedicated to supporting those customers requiring for example, special assistance \u2013 there has to be a widespread understanding culturally that everyone benefits from being able to support inclusive travel and, in turn, better supporting the special assistance teams and disabled individuals they are there to help.\nWhat kind of guidelines do you have in place as an organisation to help your employees understand how you expect them to engage with passengers that sit outside that \u2018standard\u2019 traveller profile? Do you have measures in place that allow you to monitor what you\u2019re doing to reach these passengers, and how well you\u2019re doing it? Do you celebrate those individuals in your organisation that do go that extra mile for the customers they are there to support?\nDo you provide regular and consistent training opportunities for your staff around accessibility, diversity and inclusion that can help them overcome any fears they may have in saying or doing the wrong thing when it comes to supporting disabled passengers? In short, do you train to provide inclusive service?\nDo you realise the potential in doing all of the above?\nTo return to my first point, if travel companies aren\u2019t monitoring the numbers of disabled passengers travelling with them, then they aren\u2019t truly understanding their significance regarding the bottom line either. What we do know is that the \u2018Purple Pound\u2019, which is the estimated spending power per annum of disabled people and their immediate family, is valued at an estimated \u00a3249 billion, and that this is a market sector that cannot be ignored.\nThe caveat here should always be, however, that accessible and inclusive travel experiences should be a right for everyone. So, have you reviewed and re-imagined how you do things to make a wider consideration for inclusion \u2013 and that means inclusion for every traveller, whatever their individual needs may be? From my perspective as a disabled traveller myself, it feels to me that the answer to too many of these questions is still \u2018no\u2019. We need to start focusing on the entire travel experience rather than the destination alone.\nPregnant travellers, parents, older people, disabled travellers to name but a few \u2013 these are the kinds of labels we\u2019re working to at present. But could we be approaching travel provision around more positive behaviours and support \u2013 essentially around everyone who is part of a passenger\u2019s trip \u2013 in order to create truly inclusive experiences for all? What if travel operators looked at every touchpoint and every type of customer interaction to focus on creating a really positive change around the service proposition in general?\nFinally, are you ready to join me answering some of these questions together? I\u2019m more than happy to be proved wrong if so!"}, {"title": "Unforgettable Luxury Travel Experiences", "article": "Roll up your sleeves and learn how to make pizza from scratch on this private hands on cookery class\nLearn all the techniques to create an authentic Italian pizza with guidance from your \u201cpizzaiolo\u201d guide\nPrepare the dough, the sauce and create your own pizza topping before baking it in a traditional wood-fired pizza oven"}, {"title": "Creating Inclusive Travel Experiences: DMO Strategies", "article": "For over two years, closures and restrictions made travel inaccessible for the majority of people on the planet. Now that restrictions are largely a thing of the past and travelers are free to move about the world, people are once again turning to travel for inspiration, relaxation, and the opportunity to experience something new.\nIt goes without saying that those opportunities should be available to everyone, regardless of race, gender identity, or sexual orientation.\u00c2\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been in the travel industry for more than 15 years\u00e2\u0080\u0094some might even say I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m an expert in the field. As a cisgender heterosexual white male, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m acutely aware that I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t experienced the hurdles or prejudices others have when traveling to certain destinations.\nHowever, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen first-hand how travel connects people and bridges divides, and I want that experience for others. As a leader in the travel industry, I feel like it is my duty to ensure that everyone has a good experience, and that means helping every traveler feel safe and welcome on every trip.\nWorking with destination marketing organizations, I have learned how destinations can create safe, welcoming, and inclusive spaces for diverse travelers. Here are some ways destination marketers can support that vision.\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nIntegrate values that match up with the needs of diverse travelers.\u00c2\nJust like with other products, travelers are \u00e2\u0080\u009cshopping their values.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They want inclusive, accessible destinations where they know they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll feel safe and welcomed. According to a recent survey from Accenture, approximately three out of every five travelers want their travel providers to share similar diversity and inclusion values.\nWhen LGBTQ+ and ethnic minorities responded, that number increased to nearly three out of every four travelers. In today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s market, travelers are no longer willing to compromise their beliefs, which means destinations must prioritize diversity and inclusion to create the right reputation and win travel bookings.\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nEnsure authenticity for your destination through collaboration and accessibility.\u00c2\nDiversity and inclusion go well beyond marketing; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a way of life and a belief system that requires destination marketers to think about the messaging they're putting out and what kind of destination they want to be. You must become advocates for both your destination and the travelers you want to attract, and advocacy isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just about race or gender.\nIt also includes abilities, such as making places wheelchair accessible or safe for those with autism, and meeting the diverse needs of all travelers. Above all, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to be authentic. This level of grit, sweat, and passion goes way beyond a hollow tagline. Travelers will see through any attempts to woo them without substance.\u00c2\nOne of the best ways to be authentic is to have open-minded conversations and learn from travelers who are looking for inclusive destinations. Rather than making assumptions or boxing in travelers, speak directly to Black, Latino, Asian and LBGTQ+ travelers to find out what they really want and embrace who they are. Travelers everywhere want the same thing\u00e2\u0080\u0094to feel included, safe, and able to explore without prejudice.\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nConnect with travelers along their journey throughout your destination.\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the best way for you to put your best, most inclusive foot forward? First, learn which travelers are coming to your destination. You likely have diverse travelers visiting your destination, so find out who they are and what they want and find ways to accommodate and inspire them.\nFor example, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re attracting LGBTQ+ travelers, you could put on more LGBTQ+-friendly events, which will naturally encourage travelers to return and attract new travelers. The best way to do this is to band together. Embracing diversity is a collective effort, so work with hotels, restaurants, and attractions in your destination to ensure travelers will have the same inclusive experience wherever they go.\nIn addition to knowing your travelers and working together, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to have the right toolkit. For example, Destinations International is creating diversity and inclusion toolkits for destinations. Your website is the face of your destination and a huge part of your toolkit, so periodically review your content. Do you use inclusive language? Would a traveler feel safe and comfortable when visiting?\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nDestinations leading the charge in making travel accessible for all.\nA number of destinations are working diligently to ensure travelers from all backgrounds feel safe and accepted. New York City\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website is rich with options for all travelers, ranging from The Black Experience to halal-friendly options and AAPI leaders.\nBoston recently launched its All Inclusive campaign, offering insights into Boston\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cultural diversity and helping travelers understand their options for accessibility around the city.\nThis year, Cleveland celebrated Freedom Fest in honor of Juneteenth, while Baltimore continues to celebrate its diverse population. Regardless of the destination, there are so many incredible ways to showcase diverse populations and traditions while welcoming travelers from all backgrounds.\u00c2\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nEnsuring inclusive and accessible environments into the future.\nI am proud to be part of an industry that connects human beings and helps us realize we are all the same. Travel is the best weapon to break down ignorance and judgment barriers. It is inspirational to witness destination marketers leading the charge to promote diversity and inclusion and make travel accessible to all people.\nBy creating inclusive, safe environments, DMOs are positioned to lead the charge in making sure travelers can explore the world in which we live.\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d"}, {"title": "Accessibility and Inclusivity in Tourism: Making Travel Experiences More Accessible for People with Disabilities", "article": "Tired of looking at tour options only to find that none of them seem to be accessible to people with disabilities?

So get out your passport and join us as we explore the exciting world of inclusive travel!\nUnderstanding The Challenges Faced By People With Disabilities\nUnderstanding the difficulties that people with disabilities confront is essential before attempting to make travel experiences more accessible for them. Although it's a common misconception that places or activities are off-limits to people with impairments, this hypothesis has to be further examined. While there are unquestionably barriers and restrictions, it's vital to remember that those with disabilities can travel and have travel desires. We are better able to meet their needs and design inclusive experiences if we have a greater grasp of the particular difficulties they face. We can open the door for accessible transportation options for people with impairments by doing this.\nAccessible Transportation Options For Travelers With Disabilities\nMaking accessible transportation options available is crucial to enhancing the travel experiences of those with impairments. Making sure that people with disabilities have equal access to the opportunity to visit fascinating new locations and take in the landscape is necessary to achieve this. By offering accessible transportation choices, such as trains with ramps and lifts or wheelchair-accessible automobiles, we can remove obstacles and promote a more inviting travel experience. Signposts and clear directions can be installed in transportation hubs to help passengers navigate terminals with ease. We might also provide useful equipment, such as audio announcements and tactile maps, to enhance the whole travel experience for people with disabilities.\nTo properly appreciate the relevance of accessible transportation alternatives for individuals with disabilities, let's think of them as doors to opportunities that are just waiting to be opened. These options allow people to embark on exciting activities without worrying about accessibility limitations. Accessible transportation gives a path for exploration and discovery, opening up endless possibilities for people who may have previously felt constrained by physical limitations, much like a window allows us to see into other worlds outside of our immediate surroundings.\nAs we discuss how to make travel experiences more accessible for people with disabilities, it is critical to focus not only on transportation but also on choosing accommodations that promote accessibility. While having access to dependable transportation is important, it is equally important to guarantee that the lodgings tourists stay in while traveling are suited to meet their demands. There are several types of accommodations that promote comfort and inclusiveness, from hotels with wheelchair-accessible rooms to vacation homes with step-free entrances. So let's start with this section on selecting accommodations that prioritize accessibility while also considering how important it is for everyone to have a seamless trip experience.\nGear Up and Go!

After all, finding the right place to sit can greatly improve the overall experience. However, finding such accommodations may not always be easy. On the other hand, there are hotels and resorts that go further to meet the needs of people with disabilities by providing wheelchair access, accessible toilets and other essential facilities, but still, many places lack these basic facilities\nWhen choosing accommodations, there are a variety of accessibility factors to consider. First, it can be very helpful to learn more about a hotel\u2019s potential by reading online reviews or contacting them in person. Ask specifically about wheelchair access, elevators or ramps, accessible rooms with adequate toilets, and other services for visitors with disabilities Secondly, it is also important to know where accommodations are available. Appropriate placement of hotels or resorts can reduce the need for extensive transportation systems and make it easier for people with disabilities to enjoy nearby facilities without unnecessary barriers.\nPeople with disabilities can have a hassle-free trip that suits their requirements by prioritizing accessibility when choosing lodgings. Accessible housing for those with disabilities ensures the comfort and convenience of visitors. The next stage in improving the trip experiences of all parties involved is to look at sites with attractions that are accessible to individuals with disabilities after considering accessible transportation options (H2).\nExploring Destinations With Disability-Friendly Attractions\nIt takes more than just locating lodgings that put accessibility first to make travel experiences for individuals with disabilities more accessible. Investigate locations that provide attractions that are accessible to people with disabilities. By doing this, tourists may make sure that their entire trip will be pleasurable and gratifying. There are numerous options available for people with disabilities to fully participate in the activities offered at different tourist destinations, from touring museums with wheelchair ramps to hiking through open-air parks with accessible routes. To find these sites that are accessible to people with disabilities, preparation and study are crucial.\nFinding particular information on websites or brochures devoted to accessible tourism is one way to locate places that are accessible to people with disabilities. The major tourist destinations that have made an effort to accommodate people with various disabilities are frequently highlighted on these sites. Finding locations with attractions that are accessible to people with disabilities can also be made much easier by asking other tourists for ideas who have similar accessibility requirements.\nAdditionally, a few places offer thorough itineraries that are especially made for travelers with disabilities and list the localities' most accessible attractions. With the use of this kind of resource, tourists may effortlessly navigate around foreign locales without being concerned about running into obstacles or challenges along the route.\nTravelers who concentrate on visiting areas with attractions that are accessible to people with disabilities might have memorable experiences that are catered to their particular requirements and interests.

These recommendations aim to guide the decision-makers of natural resources in tourism in undertaking accessibility improvements. The document has a particular focus on facilitating access to protected areas, beaches and parks. The WCPA Tourism and Protected Areas Specialist Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT), acted as the expert reviewers. Their involvement was key in identifying the best actions geared towards a greater extent of accessibility and inclusiveness within nature areas, vis a vis tourism.

The ATD is an annual UNWTO distinction based on an Expert Committee evaluation, which acknowledges destinations enabling a seamless experience to any tourist, regardless of their abilities. The first ATD was awarded in 2019 and has been temporarily put on hold, given the pandemic.\nVideo \"Change your destination\" The video \u201cChange your destination\u201d was issued by Fundaci\u00f3n ONCE and UNWTO by the occasion of the 2019 International Fair of Tourism (FITUR). Facilitating travel for people with disabilities is an exceptional business opportunity. Yet, a change in mind-set and in the model of tourism services provision is needed in order to meet this major market demand. Accessible environments and services contribute to improve the quality of the tourism product and can create more job opportunities for people with disabilities. Accessibility, therefore, must be an intrinsic part of any responsible and sustainable tourism policy and strategy.\nWorld Tourism Day 2016: \"Tourism for All - promoting universal accessibility\" To mark the celebration of the World Tourism Day 2016 under the theme \"Tourism for All - promoting universal accessibility\" UNWTO, the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT) and the Spanish ONCE Foundation for the Social Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities have produced a compilation of Good Practices in the Accessible Tourism Supply Chain. While these examples provide a small sample of possible solutions regarding accessibility, they will hopefully inspire others to take steps towards broadening the availability of accessible offers in tourism destinations around the world.

The UNWTO Recommendations on Accessible Information in Tourism have been developed with the support and collaboration of the ONCE Foundation for Cooperation and Social Inclusion of People with Disabilities and the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT).

The manuals are meant to assist tourism stakeholders in improving the accessibility of tourism destinations, facilities and services worldwide.\nHighlights of the 1st UNWTO Conference on Accessible Tourism in Europe In recognition of accessibility\u2019s importance in the tourism sector, UNWTO and the Government of San Marino jointly organized the 1st UNWTO Conference on Accessible Tourism in Europe (19 - 20 November 2014). Drawing together policy makers, tourism destinations, the private sector and civil society, this landmark event addressed challenges in advancing quality, sustainability and competitiveness within the tourism sector through universal accessibility. This publication features 14 good practices presented at the Conference which focus on accessibility of cultural heritage sites, policy frameworks and strategic actions to make accessible tourism a reality.

Published At 01/01/2010 What is \"Accessible Tourism\"?\nThere is no single, universally accepted definition of \"accessible tourism\". Here we refer to some of the ways in which the term is defined and used. The concept is certain to evolve as it is applied in more and more contexts around the world.\n- \u201cAccessible Tourism\u201d (also known as \u201cAccess Tourism\u201d, \u201cUniversal Tourism\u201d, \u201cInclusive Tourism\u201d and in some countries such as in Japan \u201cBarrier-free Tourism\u201d) is tourism and travel that is accessible to all people, with disabilities or not, including those with mobility, hearing, sight, cognitive, or intellectual and psychosocial disabilities, older persons and those with temporary disabilities\" (Takayama Declaration - Appendix, UNESCAP, 2009).\n- \" 'Accessible Tourism' refers to tourism that caters to the needs of a full range of consumers including persons with disabilities, older persons and cross-generational families. It entails removal of attitudinal and institutional barriers in society, and encompasses accessibility in the physical environment, in transportation, information and communications and other facilities and services. It encompasses publicly and privately owned tourist locations.\" (Takayama City and UNESCAP Conference - Press Release - Takayama, 2009)\n- \"Accessible tourism is the ongoing endeavour to ensure tourist destinations, products and services are accessible to all people, regardless of their physical limitations, disabilities or age. It encompasses publicly and privately owned tourist locations. The improvements not only benefit those with permanent physical disabilities, but also parents with small children, elderly travellers, people with temporary injuries such as a broken leg, as well as their travel companions.\" (Accessible Tourism on Wikipedia - downloaded 1 January 2010).\n- ...a process of enabling people with disabilities and seniors to function independently and with equity and dignity through the delivery of universal tourism products, services and environments. The definition is inclusive of the mobility, vision, hearing and cognitive dimensions of access (Darcy, 2006, p. 6).\nDarcy, S. (2006). Setting a Research Agenda for Accessible Tourism. In C. Cooper, T. D. LacY & L. Jago (Eds.), STCRC Technical Report Seriespp. 48).

This definition is inclusive of all people including those travelling with children in prams, people with disabilities and seniors (Darcy & Dickson, 2009, p. 34). Reference : Darcy, S., & Dickson, T. (2009). A Whole-of-Life Approach to Tourism: The Case for Accessible Tourism Experiences. Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management, 16(1), 32-44.\n- ...When people hear the word \u201caccessible\u201d attached to tourism they think they have a pretty good idea what that means. And there is the problem. Almost everybody thinks they know what it means but, since it has never been fully defined, almost everybody has invented their own personal definition. That is a recipe for disaster. If travellers and the industry have no common language, then imagine how frequent disappointment and disputes will become? If hotel owners and construction teams have no way to describe the solutions they want designed and built, then how likely is either side to be satisfied with the result?

That vision can be a reality with the help of ISO 21902, which facilitates enjoyment of travel by people of all ages and abilities \u2013 making tourism accessible to everyone.\nA study suggests that accessible tourism is a significant emerging market, expected to generate revenues of EUR 88.6 billion by 2025. The standard helps tourism service providers promote tourist-friendly destinations for the disabled and realize the opportunities this lucrative market has to offer. Whether you are an expectant mom, a senior citizen or a person with a disability, you have the same right as everybody else to enjoy life through barrier-free tourism.

It\u2019s an extension of our ethnic identities, not to mention our personal histories. One of the best ways to fully experience a country\u2019s local culture is to have a taste of its unique cuisine, which is why it\u2019s so important that we preserve it the right way.\nISO 21621 outlines requirements and recommendations for traditional restaurants worldwide to provide tourists with a local, authentic culinary experience. At the heart of the standard is preserving tradition, from specifying what restaurants should look like to how food is to be served to demonstrate that they stay true to their heritage. This will help tourists make more informed choices on where to dine and savour the locals\u2019 culinary pride.\nTravelling green\nSustainability will continue to be a priority for hotels in 2022 and beyond, with recent studies suggesting that 76 % of travellers would choose accommodation facilities that have sustainable practices in place. With the help of ISO 21401, accommodation facilities can improve their environmental impact, promote social exchange and contribute to local communities.\nAccommodation is pivotal for tourist activities and holds immense potential for sustainable tourism. The global interest in sustainability increases people\u2019s desire to experience more sustainable services and products. As travellers become more aware of the importance of sustainability, they can enjoy guilt-free holidays knowing that they have contributed to protecting our planet by choosing sustainable accommodation along with its eco-friendly services."}, {"title": "Accessibility", "article": "Accessible tourism\nAll tourism businesses and institutions should aim to be universally accessible and create barrier-free tourism.

Certain sustainable development is ambiguous ground but in the tourism activities it is very pressing for the negative impacts of the classical tourism model.\nThese assumptions are useful to analyze the costs and benefits of inclusive tourism, thanks to the pyramid of accessibility. This study will in fact make it possible to determine, on the basis of the resources present in the territory, the opportunities and limits of this type of tourism.\nIn European destinations, above all, in Italy, the openness to inclusive tourism can constitute a new cycle of tourism product such as to activate that interest and curiosity that drives tourists to visit the destination. This chapter describes at first the criteria for the planning of tourism for all, and finally, in the second part, it will deal with the international policies for the realization of tourism for all.\nThe traditional model of tourist destination is characterized by tourist attractions and related infrastructure, often avoiding the local people. The resort or tourist villages are born to entertain tourists, but they did not involve local people. Nowadays the tourism and the resorts are changing, and so a lot of destinations are involving a new idea of tourism with the accomplishment of the local people that can support the persons with specials needs to live an independent travel as inhabitans.\nIt is therefore necessary to look for new models in tourism that can create a dialogue, peace and fruitful encounter between guests and the local community. This involvement, in fact, can be activated directly or indirectly \u2013 with or without the presence of the local community in all activities of tours \u2013 but always in accordance with the need of each other. Tourism for all is a new idea but is the future of tourism for different reasons: the first is that the needs of people, especially those with differences or disabilities, are increased in all parts of the world and they required the solution immediately and tailor-made; the second consists in the hypothesis that if guests can have more economic and especially technological potential, they can support and transfer their know-how to all those who suffer from that particular disorder, providing this benefit; and the third gives sustainability using the appropriate resources to enhance tourist activities.\nIn this new vision, the World Tourism Organization has attributed to tourism for all a broader vision than accessible tourism alone, combining sustainable and social tourism in a single form of tourism, including every person regardless of gender or other forms of diversity.\nIn the innovative strategy of inclusive tourism, it should be pointed out that destinations will have to develop plans and appropriate policies for sustainability and accessibility. This form of tourism, which certainly has social aims, could also be conflicting if, for example, accessibility makes use of very invasive technologies or not too much in line with the efficiency and protection of the environment. Tourism for all, therefore, becomes an ambitious project to be implemented at the local level to create a model, so valid to the global level."}, {"title": "Search strategies in accessible tourism, barrier-free tourism, disabled tourism and easy access tourism literature", "article": "Research concerning the inclusion of individuals with disabilities in tourism activities began long before this field of study was formally named.

You can travel on many buses, trains, taxis and underground networks without needing to book a ticket or arrange help in advance. All public transport providers must provide an accessible service. In practice, you may not be able to use their service at all times or without a staff member to help you. So it's a good idea to book support in advance if you can, particularly if you are travelling from a smaller station.

Travel apps There are travel apps that can give you some useful updates, but these are not specific to disabled travellers. Train and bus companies often have their own mobile apps. These apps should be accessible, but not all of them are. Citymapper and Google Maps both have \u2018commute\u2019 options. They allow you to set up a planned journey, and tell you if there are changes or delays. AA maps can give you updates on traffic in your area.

Tell staff you\u2019ve booked assistance Arrive at the station at least 20 minutes early and tell station staff you have booked assistance. This gives them time to check help is in place and make other arrangements if necessary. If you cannot find a member of staff, go to the ticket office or use the help points on platforms. Some large mainline stations have Network Rail Assistance Offices where you can find assistance staff. Check with the rail company about what\u2019s available. If you\u2019re at an unstaffed station and there are no help points or an assistance helpline, you could try contacting the train company or National Rail Enquiries on 03457 48 49 50.

Wheelchairs and mobility scooters On mainline (intercity, suburban and cross-country) trains, you may need to reserve a space for your wheelchair. If your wheelchair is bigger than the standard size (700 mm wide by 1200 mm long), you\u2019ll need to check if your wheelchair can fit on the train. Train companies have different policies about using mobility scooters. You can carry a folded-up scooter onto the train as luggage. If you want to take a larger scooter, contact the train company to find out if they can carry them.\nUnderground networks Some underground stations are more accessible than others. London Underground and London Docklands Light Railway (DLR) Less than a third of tube stations have step-free access.

You can also check the standard tube map for stations with a: blue wheelchair symbol for step-free access\nwhite wheelchair symbol for step-free access and no gaps between the train and the platform\nan open circle symbol for a step-free interchange You do not have to book assistance on the TfL network. They operate a \u2018turn-up-and-go\u2019 service. This means you can ask staff at the station to help you or get support through a help point. Help from staff (Transport for London) If the lifts are out of use, ask a member of staff for an alternative route or if there\u2019s a service lift you can use. All DLR stations have lift or ramp access to the platforms and level access to trains. Many DLR stations do not have staff outside peak times. There should be a Passenger Service Agent on every train. You can also look for help points on the platform to speak with a member of staff. Tyne and Wear Metro All stations are accessible through lifts, ramps or level access. Many stations do not have staff but you can book assistance or speak with someone using a help point. You cannot take a powered mobility scooter on the train. Merseyrail Merseyrail\u2019s station accessibility map shows which stations have step-free access. You can also find out the size of the gap between the train and the platform at each station. Many stations do not have staff but you can book help if you need it.

In some areas such as larger cities, licensed taxis must be wheelchair accessible. You can book a licensed black cab through the Gett app. Licensed minicabs are usually too small to take a powered or unfolded wheelchair. Some minicab companies, like Uber, let you select a wheelchair accessible vehicle.\nBuses and coaches In most towns and cities, buses have ramps and wheelchair spaces. Check with your local bus company. You can take some smaller mobility scooters on low-floor buses. REACT is a talking sign system that gives real-time information via electronic display boards. Contact your local bus company to see if it\u2019s available on your route. Some coach companies operate accessible coaches, including: National Express\nOxford Tube\nmegabus Check if the coach station is accessible and book help if you need it. Help to get on or off The law says bus and coach drivers must give reasonable assistance to disabled people. This does not mean physically lifting passengers or heavy mobility equipment. You can ask the bus driver to: help you get up the ramp on the bus if the gradient is too steep\nhelp you with bags or luggage\nwait until you\u2019re seated before driving If you need help to get on and off a coach, ask for this when you book your ticket.\nMaking a complaint Staff should treat you respectfully. If they do not, or they refuse to assist you, it\u2019s important to complain. Complaining about public transport\nDriving If planning journeys on public transport is difficult for you, you could think about using the Motability Scheme to pay for the costs of leasing a car, scooter or powered wheelchair. You are eligible to join the Motability Scheme if you\u2019ve been awarded either the: higher rate mobility component of Disability Living Allowance (DLA) for 12 months or more\nthe enhanced rate mobility component of Personal Independence Payment (PIP) for 12 months or more To join the scheme, you will need to pay using the components of these benefits. The scheme pays for insurance, breakdown cover and vehicle tax. The scheme can pay for some driving lessons. It does not pay for fuel.

It helps us get to work, stay in touch with friends and family, contribute to society and access vital services like healthcare and education. Easy access to transport is central to building a stronger, fairer economy.\nWhile many take for granted the ability to travel easily from A to B, this is not the reality for everyone. For our ageing population, and the fifth of people who identify as having some sort of disability, access to transport can be far from straightforward. That is why this Government is determined to make sure that disabled people have the same access to transport as everyone else, and that they are able to travel easily, confidently and without extra cost. We have a manifesto commitment to get a million more disabled people into work by 2027, and this Strategy will help to deliver that.\nI have been encouraged by the increasing awareness among transport operators of the need to design and deliver their services in a genuinely inclusive way, in particular the greater recognition that less visible disabilities such as autism, dementia or anxiety can be just as much of a barrier to travel as a visible disability.\nHowever, there is much still to be done if we are to realise our ambition of delivering real change for disabled people on our transport networks, and achieving our goal of creating a transport system offering equal access for disabled people by 2030.\nThis strategy builds on the responses received to our 2017 consultation on a draft Accessibility Action Plan, and sets out how we will deliver the necessary changes to our transport networks, both through government interventions and working in partnership with industry and others.\nSome of this will naturally take time, in particular where improvements to our infrastructure or legislative changes are required. However there are many things which can be done quickly and at relatively low cost, such as improving the training of staff, making information more accessible and ensuring existing legislation is properly enforced. This Strategy sets out an ambitious programme of work to deliver these improvements over the next few years. Taking steps such as supporting the establishment by the industry of a Rail Ombudsman to investigate unresolved customer complaints, or introducing real-time information on the availability of assistance and services will make a real difference for disabled people.\nIn the longer term, we also want to ensure that all future transport technologies and services are designed in a genuinely inclusive way, opening up new opportunities for disabled people. This will form a central part of the Future of Mobility Grand Challenge set out in the Government\u2019s Industrial Strategy.\nThis Strategy will only be successful if properly implemented, so it also sets out a clear programme of monitoring and evaluation and a new governance framework to ensure we hold ourselves to account. Alongside regular reporting to Parliament, a new stakeholder advisory group will be established involving local government, transport operators, disabled people\u2019s organisations and charities. In developing this Strategy, I have met with many of the organisations representing disabled people, as well as the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee ( DPTAC ). I will continue to meet with DPTAC regularly, and look forward to meeting the new advisory group in the near future. I intend to bring these groups together with the internal programme board ever year to review progress.\nDelivering the ambitions set out in this Strategy will require work across Government, for instance improving journeys to hospitals. In May, the Government announced that the Secretary of State for the Department for Work and Pensions will chair a new inter-ministerial group on Disabled People and Society. The Department for Transport will play a key role in this group and will ensure the goals set out in this Strategy receive the support they need from across Government.\nWe have come a long way, but a genuinely inclusive transport system will be central to this Government\u2019s mission to build a country that works for everyone. There is much still to be done and Government cannot do this on its own. I look forward to working with the many groups, organisations and individuals who will all have an important role to play in making this happen.\nThank you for your support.\nNusrat Ghani Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport\nDPTAC Chair foreword\nDPTAC \u2019s vision is that disabled people should have the same access to transport as everybody else, to be able to go where everyone else goes and to do so easily, confidently and without extra cost. The DfT \u2019s Inclusive Transport Strategy has the potential to be a key vehicle for achieving the improvements that are needed. What brings the Strategy to life are its clarity, ambition, and set of practical actions across all transport modes and the built environment that connects them.\nTo keep the strategy alive and relevant it is essential to monitor and track improvements over time, to have clear deliverable outcomes, to use robust regulatory activity and enforcement, and to provide easy access to redress for consumers when things go wrong. The Strategy brings welcome attention to all of these important issues.\nDPTAC \u2019s focus is on making sure that the Department delivers accessibility for disabled people in all areas of its work, that it understands and takes full account of the interests of disabled people in the way it develops policy, plans its strategy, carries out its monitoring, regulatory and enforcement work, and in the way it helps and guides consumers and the industry.\nCrucially, the Strategy presents an opportunity to speed up the pace of change in a number of key areas, particularly around staff training, the availability of accessible information, and the ability to secure redress when things go wrong.\nThere\u2019s no denying that we have seen significant improvements in the accessibility of transport over the last few decades, largely driven by changes in the law. But there has also been an increasing recognition that tapping into the \u00a3249 billion of spending power of households with a disabled person in them makes good business sense for the transport sector, and that ensuring that all disabled people have full access to work, healthcare, and a social life makes good sense for the economy.\nThe availability of free, easy-to-use and binding redress is a very important driver of improved business behaviour in any sector. The introduction of a Rail Ombudsman will be a significant benefit for consumers and will improve service quality. We want to see this model developed to cover all transport modes, giving confidence to disabled consumers that should they face poor quality service, or exclusion, on any part of their journey their dispute will be sorted quickly and the likelihood of it happening again in future reduced.\nOf particular note in the Strategy is the much-needed work to raise awareness within the DfT about its Public Sector Equality Duty, aimed at ensuring that the needs of all people with protected characteristics are fully considered as part of transport policy development and delivery.\nEvery journey is door-to-door, so consistency of expectation and experience across local, regional, national and international transport is key to ensure the outcome of accessibility is achieved. This Strategy takes that whole journey approach.\nPublication of this Strategy is just one step on an ongoing journey. DPTAC has played a key role in its development and of the actions that underpin it, and we will continue to hold the Department to account after publication. We will also continue to advice, challenge, inspire and influence all of those we talk to with one aim - to bring about real change that improves access to transport for disabled people, using this Strategy and future iterations as a toolbox to achieve that change.\nKeith Richards Chair of the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee\nExecutive summary\nThis Strategy sets out the Government\u2019s plans to make our transport system more inclusive, and to make travel easier for disabled people. While it is focused on the inclusion of disabled people, many of the improvements will also benefit other travellers.\nChapter 1 sets out the Government\u2019s ambition for disabled people to have the same access to transport as everyone else, and to be able to travel confidently, easily and without extra cost. By 2030[footnote 1], we envisage equal access for disabled people using the transport system, with assistance if physical infrastructure remains a barrier.\nChapter 2 explains why the Government has moved from an Accessibility Action Plan to a more holistic Inclusive Transport Strategy, encompassing a wide range of measures to support people with both visible and less visible impairments. It sets out the Strategy\u2019s five main themes:\nAwareness and enforcement of passenger rights - raising awareness of the obligations on transport operators, the processes for raising concerns or complaints and working with regulators to hold operators to account.\nStaff training - ensuring that transport staff (frontline and managerial) understand the needs of disabled people with physical, mental, cognitive or sensory impairments, and can provide better assistance.\nImproving information - ensuring that transport operators provide travel information in formats that all passengers can easily access and understand, before and during a journey.\nImproving physical infrastructure - ensuring that vehicles, stations and streetscapes are designed, built and operated so that they are easy to use for all.\nThe future of inclusive transport - ensuring that technological advances and new business models provide opportunities for all, and that disabled people are involved from the outset in their design.\nChapter 3 describes the progress that has been made to date, as well as the different ways in which funding has been made available to improve transport infrastructure and services. This includes:\nMore than \u00a3500 million of funding available to deliver accessible rail routes since 2006, such as the redevelopment of Birmingham New Street station.\nContinued funding for Mobility Centres which offer clinical expertise and professional high quality information, advice and assessment to people who need to gain or retain independence through mobility.\nResearch and innovation competitions, such as the Rail Accessibility Competition and the Transport Technology Research Innovation Grant.\nOver \u00a32.5 billion on mobility awards in 2017/18 [footnote 2] .\n. Around \u00a31 billion each year on concessionary fares for older and disabled people using local bus services.\nChapter 4 sets out disabled passengers\u2019 rights and the service they can expect to receive in each mode of transport (with more detail provided in annex B). It also presents the key advances travellers can expect to see as a result of the Strategy.\nChapter 5 explains how the Government will raise awareness of the rights of disabled travellers, and how it will ensure better enforcement of existing legislation. It announces the launch of a new public awareness campaign, working with a wide range of partners, including DPTAC , to promote ways of positively interacting with disabled people in order to ensure a supportive travelling experience and reduce instances of disability related hate crime on transport. Other key commitments include:\nWorking with the rail industry and consumer groups we will support the establishment of a Rail Ombudsman to investigate unresolved customer complaints and issue decisions that are binding on the industry.\nWe will identify a framework to ensure bus operators are implementing mandatory bus driver training.\nWe will ensure that disabled travellers are fully aware of their rights and the obligations of transport operators, and that easily accessible information is available in a variety of formats on how to raise complaints.\nWe will promote the assistance and financial savings available to disabled travellers, through schemes such as the Disabled Persons Railcard, the Passenger Assist scheme for rail travel and disabled bus concessions.\nWe will require a minimum target for the successful completion of booked assistance through the Passenger Assist scheme, and ensure that train operators who fail to deliver the assistance booked will provide financial compensation to passengers.\nWe will support regulators to promote information about the rights of disabled travellers, as well as developing easier ways to register complaints when things go wrong.\nWe will release an online tool to assist disabled people in reporting issues they encounter when travelling by bus, with the development of this tool being informed by the experiences of disabled people.\nWe will consult on revised best practice guidance to support local licensing authorities (LLAs) to use their existing powers in respect of taxis and private hire vehicles more effectively.\nWe will work with the Civil Aviation Authority ( CAA ) to review performance standards for airports and airlines, using the upcoming Aviation Strategy to set out any areas in which these standards need to be tougher.\n) to review performance standards for airports and airlines, using the upcoming Aviation Strategy to set out any areas in which these standards need to be tougher. We will review the powers the CAA has to enforce regulations and strengthen them if evidence suggests this is required.\nChapter 6 sets out actions to improve the training that those delivering transport services receive. It includes commitments to develop a disability awareness training package setting out how transport staff can provide effective customer service to disabled people. This package will be made available to all transport operators and will be incorporated into an inclusive transport leaders\u2019 scheme through which transport operators will be expected to make further commitments to improve the services they provide to disabled people. Other key commitments include:\nEnsuring that transport operators and providers train frontline staff and senior management on disability awareness, involving disabled people in the development and delivery of this training [footnote 3] .\n. Publicising good practice and leading the way by providing disability awareness training for DfT staff.\nstaff. Ensuring that all public transport bodies understand their obligations under the Public Sector Equality Duty in relation to planning and delivering transport, and that they understand the risks of legal proceedings brought by the public or through enforcement action by the Equality and Human Rights Commission for non-compliance.\nChapter 7 explains the steps the Department will take to ensure disabled passengers can access the right information to help them plan their journey, including journey-planning information as well as real-time information on the availability of assistance and services. It also describes the steps that will be taken to create a more inclusive travelling experience, including by addressing instances of disability-related hate crime. Key commitments include:\nLegislation to ensure the provision of on-board audible and visible upcoming stop and route information is installed on local bus services across Great Britain. We will also provide \u00a32 million of new funding to help bus operators install the necessary equipment more quickly.\nWe will increase the availability of data on accessibility and, where possible, produce league tables to better inform disabled people. We will also publicise the work undertaken by individual operators to improve inclusivity.\nWe will ensure transport providers improve the availability of information particularly in relation to accessibility services such as toilets.\nWe will work with Train Operating Companies to help ensure that all disabled passengers are aware of the Passenger Assist service\nWe will work with the Rail Delivery Group ( RDG ) to review the eligibility criteria for the Disabled Persons Rail Card.\n) to review the eligibility criteria for the Disabled Persons Rail Card. We will also work with the RDG and innovators in the technology sector to provide improved information about the accessibility of stations, including the development of an accessibility map by the RDG .\nand innovators in the technology sector to provide improved information about the accessibility of stations, including the development of an accessibility map by the . We will work with the aviation industry to improve the information and advice available to disabled adults and children travelling by air. We will set out these actions in the Aviation Strategy green paper in the autumn of 2018.\nChapter 8 sets out the physical infrastructure changes which will be made to make it easier for disabled people to access transport. This includes the steps that will be taken to make journeys by car easier for disabled people, including \u00a32 million of new funding to increase significantly the numbers of Changing Places facilities at motorway service areas. It will also address concerns about pavement parking. It sets out the steps the Department is taking to encourage local licensing authorities to increase the numbers of wheelchair-accessible taxis and private hire vehicles, as well as what the Department will do to improve the experiences of disabled people on buses, at airports and on journeys to hospitals. Key commitments include:\nWe will make up to \u00a3300 million available for rail accessibility improvements during the period 2019-2024.\nWe will kick-start improvements in physical infrastructure with a new \u00a32 million fund for industry to deliver a rapid step-change in the availability of Changing Places facilities across the motorway network, allowing the majority of motorway service areas to have them in place by the early 2020s.\nWe will invest \u00a32 million towards ensuring audio visual equipment is installed on buses.\nWe will recommend that local authorities pause the development of shared space schemes while we review and update the Department\u2019s guidance.\nWe will update the Department\u2019s Inclusive Mobility and Tactile Paving guidance.\nWe will publish each year a list of those authorities which do, and do not, publish lists of wheelchair accessible taxis.\nWe will announce how we will seek to prioritise access to the on-board wheelchair space for wheelchair users and other passengers for whom there is no other suitable accommodation on buses.\nWe will gather evidence on pavement parking, including on the effectiveness of current laws, and potential alternatives.\nWe will publish an Aviation Strategy for consultation, which will contain policy proposals to improve disabled people\u2019s access to, and experience of, using aviation.\nChapter 9 describes some of the ways in which the transport system is likely to change over the years ahead, including the introduction of new technologies and business models such as mobility as a service and connected and autonomous vehicles. With inclusivity designed in from the start, these new technologies and business models could transform mobility for disabled people. But without the right regulatory framework, people with reduced mobility could find themselves excluded from new models and find the existing services they rely on severely disrupted. This chapter therefore explains what the Government will do to ensure that these changes are delivered in such a way as to allow everyone, including disabled people, to benefit from them. Key commitments include:\nWe will set a clear direction to industry on the importance of inclusive design as part of future innovation through the forthcoming Future of Urban Mobility Call for Evidence.\nWe will ensure that accessibility is considered throughout the Future of Mobility Regulatory Review. This will include examining whether new regulation is needed to ensure that emerging technologies and services are accessible.\nWe will engage directly with disabled people and organisations as part of our development of future transport strategy.\nWe will ensure that DfT innovation competitions highlight the need for prospective funding recipients to consider accessibility and inclusive design within their project proposals.\nChapter 10 sets out how the Government will hold itself to account for the delivery of this Strategy. Key commitments include:\nWithin six months of the publication of this Strategy we will publish a monitoring and evaluation framework specifying key output indicators to assess our progress against our ambition and actions.\nWe will report to Parliament on the delivery of the Strategy a year after publication and regularly thereafter.\nWe will create a new stakeholder advisory group, the Pan-disability Transport Advisory Group ( PTAG ), to provide external support in rolling out the actions in the Strategy.\n), to provide external support in rolling out the actions in the Strategy. We will use the new Inter-Ministerial Group on Disabled People and Society to ensure cross-government support for the actions in the Strategy.\nAnnex A is a list of the local licensing authorities with the highest proportion of wheelchair accessible vehicles in their taxi fleets.\nAnnex B is a summary of the key rights of disabled passengers using the transport system, and how to make complaints where these are not being upheld.\n1. The Government\u2019s ambition for inclusive transport\nOur ambition Our vision is for disabled people to have the same access to transport as everyone else. They will travel confidently, easily and without extra cost. By 2030 we envisage equal access for disabled people using the transport system, with assistance if physical infrastructure remains a barrier.\n[footnote 4]\n1.1 As part of our ambition to build a society that works for all, the Government wants to make the transport system inclusive and able to meet the needs of all people regardless of whether they are disabled or not. Our goal is for disabled people to be able to access the transport system easily, confidently and at no extra cost. In turn this will support the Government\u2019s wider commitments to enable a million more disabled people to take up employment over the next 10 years[footnote 5], to secure 3 million new apprenticeships by 2020 (PDF, 1,277KB), and to tackle loneliness.\n1.2 There has been significant progress in transport accessibility in recent years, partly driven by legislative developments, culminating in the Equality Act 2010. However, there are still a number of areas within transport provision where improvements are needed. Much of our rail infrastructure was built in the Victorian era when the needs of disabled people were simply not considered in the same way as they are today. In addition, whilst we have seen improvements in the accessibility of our roads, light rail, maritime and aviation sectors we still have some way to go to ensuring that transport operators provide disabled people with the information they need to use transport services. Further work is also needed to secure shared industry standards for staff training on disability awareness and ensure that this training enables staff to provide good customer service, and that there is a simple, effective process for addressing instances when something goes wrong.\n1.3 Our aim is to see ongoing change in the transport system, both in terms of design, physical access and customer service that gives disabled people the confidence to travel. We recognise that whilst technological change can happen quickly, societal and organisational change can take time and given the number of transport operators, providers and regulators in the sector, this will be best achieved by an evolution, not revolution, of the transport system. Therefore, in this Inclusive Transport Strategy, we have set a number of short to medium term objectives as well as longer term aspirations for the kind of transport system we wish to create for the future. Only by creating a clear plan for change with related timescales for delivery, by continually challenging ourselves, and by being held to account by transport users, disabled people\u2019s organisations, the Minister for Disabled People\u2019s transport sector champions and our independent statutory advisory committee, the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee ( DPTAC ), will we be truly ambitious.\n1.4 The benefits to creating an inclusive transport system are undeniable. Transport has the ability to open doors, to unlock potential and to increase confidence. It enables people to see family and friends as well as seek and access employment. It can make the difference between feeling socially isolated and feeling socially included. But transport can also be one of the biggest barriers faced by disabled people with some people having difficulty physically accessing services, struggling to plan their journeys due to a lack of accessible travel information or having negative experiences with transport staff or other passengers which knocks their confidence in travelling. By providing a truly inclusive transport system, we can help increase independence for all.\n1.5 We believe in a transport system that meets the needs of all travellers. In some cases this will mean retrofitting existing systems, but our ambition is to build upon our existing legislation and continue to progress towards a position where all new systems and infrastructure are designed and built with inclusivity established at the outset. As our transport system evolves, new opportunities will become available through developments such as demand responsive transport and connected and autonomous vehicles. It is essential that these developments are made with proper engagement between the transport sector and disabled people in order to maximise the opportunities these future technologies can offer and avoid the creation of further gaps between those who can easily access transport and those who cannot.\n1.6 We believe that a more inclusive transport system will create a more prosperous transport industry. There are real commercial benefits to improving access and ease of transport, not only to disabled people but for all transport users. From staff training which meets the needs of the individual to audio visual travel information, and infrastructure planned and built around the travelling public - a more inclusive transport system will result in more passengers, jobs and customers for all.\n1.7 We cannot achieve this ambition in isolation however. We will work across Government (through the Inter-Ministerial Group on Disabled People and Society), and with local authorities, transport operators and regulators to deliver our ambitions and aspirations. We will also need to engage the travelling public who can play a large part in making transport more inclusive by being considerate of the needs and experiences of others. We want our ambition to be a shared ambition. This is why we asked for views on our draft Accessibility Action Plan and why, throughout the development of this Strategy, we have worked closely with the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee ( DPTAC ) and other stakeholders. We will continue to do so as we implement this Strategy over the short, medium and long term. By working together we will fulfil our ambition for an inclusive transport system.\nOur objectives\n1.8 Our ambition is to deliver a transport system which enables disabled people to access and confidently use transport. We will deliver these goals through the key themes of the Inclusive Transport Strategy:\n1 Promotion of passenger rights and enforcement - All passengers should be clear on what the service they can expect, and confident that reporting non-compliance will lead to enforcement. 2 Better Staff Training - Transport staff (frontline and managerial) should have greater understanding of the needs of disabled people and their legal rights, and therefore provide better assistance. 3 Improved Information - Information should be provided in formats that all passengers can access and understand, both before and during a journey. 4 Inclusive Physical infrastructure - Vehicles, stations and streetscapes should be designed and built so that they are inclusive and easy to use. 5 Future of Inclusive Transport - New services and business models enabled by advances in technology should provide opportunities for all, and be designed from the outset with disabled people in mind.\n1.9 Specifically, we will:\nEnsure that transport operators and providers train frontline staff and senior management on disability awareness, involving disabled people in the development and delivery of this training wherever possible.\nPublicise good practice training guidance to support this, and as part of encouraging take up, will lead the way by providing disability equality and awareness training for DfT staff as part of our staff development programmes.\nstaff as part of our staff development programmes. Work to ensure that all public transport bodies understand their obligations under the Public Sector Equality Duty within the Equality Act 2010 in relation to planning and delivering transport, and they are clear that there are risks of legal proceedings brought by the public or through enforcement action by the Equality and Human Rights Commission for non-compliance [footnote 6] .\n. Ensure that disabled travellers are fully aware of their rights and the obligations of transport operators, and know how to raise complaints if needed, by the provision of easily accessible information in a variety of formats.\nWork with the rail industry to support the establishment of a Rail Ombudsman to investigate unresolved customer complaints and issue decisions that the industry are obliged to comply with.\nEstablish a framework to ensure bus operators are implementing mandatory bus driver training.\nIncrease transparency and accountability in relation to the inclusivity of the transport system. We will publish data on accessibility and where possible publicise the work undertaken by individual operators to improve inclusivity.\nContinue to make clear that we expect transport regulators to take action against operators that do not make progress, pushing them to use the powers that they have to take robust action against non-compliance, and further strengthening their powers where needed.\nLaunch a public awareness campaign, working with a wide range of partners, including DPTAC , to promote ways of positively interacting with disabled people in order to ensure a supportive travelling experience and reduce instances of disability related hate crime on transport.\n, to promote ways of positively interacting with disabled people in order to ensure a supportive travelling experience and reduce instances of disability related hate crime on transport. Promote the assistance and financial savings available to disabled travellers, through schemes such as the Disabled Persons Railcard, the Passenger Assist scheme for rail travel and disabled bus concessions in order to increase take up of these schemes.\nTake action to ensure transport providers improve the availability of information particularly in relation to real time information on accessibility services such as toilets.\nKick-start improvements in physical infrastructure by investing \u00a32 million to install more Changing Places facilities at motorway service areas across England and \u00a32 million on installing audio visual equipment on buses, and challenge the transport industry to follow our lead.\nInvest up to \u00a3300 million to extend the programme to deliver accessible routes, including step free access, at railway stations until at least 2024.\nRecommend that Local Authorities pause the development of shared space schemes which incorporate a level surface while we review and update guidance. Alongside this, we will temporarily withdraw Local Transport Note 1/11: Shared Space\nEnsure future technology is designed inclusively and opportunities are sought out to harness innovation.\n2. The policy context\nInclusive transport is a Government priority\n2.1 Disability affects 13.9 million people in the UK and can include visible disabilities (sometimes requiring physical aids) or less visible disabilities such as cognitive or sensory impairments or other medical conditions such as permanent nerve damage, back conditions, diabetes and heart conditions.\n2.2 The importance of connectivity cannot be underestimated. Being able to travel can help facilitate social networks and improve access to employment or education[footnote 7]. It can also promote self-esteem and wellbeing through leisure visits, travelling and simply \u2018leaving the house for its own sake\u2019[footnote 8]. However, for many people, the provision of travel which is accessible to them can be too inconsistent to allow for full independence. The Government is taking action to close this gap in provision, and this Strategy fits with other Government policies to increase levels of employment for disabled people, reduce loneliness in society and support independent living.\nThe ageing population\n2.3 The UK \u2019s population is ageing. By 2040, 13% of the UK population will be aged over 75 \u2013 an increase from 8% today. While many people maintain high levels of mobility and health into old age, disability has a higher prevalence as people age. In 2016/17, 45% of State Pension age adults reported having a disability; this compares to only 19% of working-age adults[footnote 9]. Conditions arising from ageing can take many forms, but will often result in a combination of symptoms, including some loss of vision and hearing, stiffness of joints, and reduction in the ability to walk long distances. These conditions can have a dramatic effect on a person\u2019s ability to travel.\n2.4 Taking forward the commitment for a Grand Challenge on Ageing, the Prime Minister announced in May that the first mission of the Grand Challenge would be for people to enjoy an extra five years of healthy and independent living by 2035, whilst also narrowing the gap between the richest and poorest. Achieving this would mean that everyone benefits from improved quality of life to match our increased longevity.\n2.5 Making this a reality will require co-ordinated action to improve health, but also new thinking about how our environment and society can support people to age well. Core to this will be supporting people to remain active and able to connect with their families and communities, and transport has a significant role to play. This is why we are looking at how the Ageing Grand Challenge and the Future of Mobility Grand Challenge can work together to address the needs of an ageing population.\nImproving connectivity to reduce loneliness\n2.6 Disability and poor health are associated with an increased risk of loneliness, with research showing that two-thirds of disabled people have felt lonely in the past year. The Government\u2019s forthcoming Loneliness Strategy, to be published later this year, will set out a range of initiatives to help tackle loneliness, including amongst disabled people. An inclusive transport system will enable disabled and older people to be more mobile and so better able to establish and maintain their own social connections, reducing their risk of loneliness. By acting to improve the inclusivity of transport now we will help lay the foundation on which the Government can achieve its ambition to build more connected and resilient communities for the future.\nInclusive transport supports employment\n2.7 Inclusive and reliable transport is essential to giving disabled people the confidence to travel and opening up access to employment. Between April and June last year, the employment rate of disabled people was 49%, significantly lower than the rate for non-disabled people - 80%. This meant that 3.8 million disabled people of working age were unemployed[footnote 10].\n2.8 This Government is committed to getting one million additional disabled people into work by 2027. The specific workplace initiatives formulated to deliver this pledge were set out in the Government\u2019s White Paper, Improving Lives[footnote 11]. The Inclusive Transport Strategy will deliver the transport improvements needed to enable disabled people to access, and feel more confident using, the transport system in order to get to work and pursue social and leisure interests.\nA more inclusive transport system supports business\n2.9 A transport system that is reliable and easy to navigate will improve the experience of all using it, not only disabled people. For example, provision of next stop announcements on buses makes travel easier for visually impaired people or those with anxiety, but also for inexperienced travellers and tourists.\n2.10 Giving disabled people the confidence to travel opens up fair and equal access to opportunity and success. More disabled people on our transport system means more passengers, a larger workforce and more customers for local businesses. Households with a disabled person in them had a spending power of \u00a3249 billion in 2014/15 (PDF, 93KB) and, as the population ages, this spending power is likely to increase. This Government wants to see transport operators and local businesses providing for this growing market.\nFuture transport needs to be inclusive\n2.11 The Future of Mobility Grand Challenge established in the Industrial Strategy recognises that we are beginning to experience profound change in how we move people, goods and services around. This is driven by extraordinary innovation in engineering, technology and business models.\n2.12 Technological developments such as more open data, and innovations such as connected and autonomous vehicles ( CAVs ) have the potential to benefit many disabled people. The fresh thinking offered through innovation could unlock benefits for many, but these will require industry to adopt an inclusive approach to product and service design which will involve active engagement with disabled people.\nFrom accessible transport to inclusive transport\n2.13 This Government wants to deliver a fully inclusive transport system. Our desire is to move from infrastructure design and service provision which focuses mainly on achieving \u2018accessible transport\u2019 (i.e. retrofitting existing infrastructure to meet the needs of disabled people) to delivering \u2018inclusive travel\u2019, (i.e. with services designed through dialogue with disabled people and other groups so that the needs of transport users are identified upfront). Such an approach removes the focus on infrastructure and takes a more holistic approach to the wide range of measures that can support people with visible and less visible impairments.\nThe draft Accessibility Action Plan consultation\n2.14 The Department ran a public consultation on the draft Accessibility Action Plan ( AAP ) between 24th August and 22nd November 2017. The draft included 48 actions which were intended to address the gaps in existing provision which serve as a barrier to disabled people[footnote 12]. In total, over 1000 responses were received and more than 100 people expressed their views at five public consultation events. Responses to the consultation were submitted by a mixture of individuals and organisations, including national and local disabled people\u2019s organisations and groups representing disabled people, local authorities, transport operators and regulators.\n2.15 There were a number of recurring themes across the responses received to the consultation:\nPromotion of passenger rights and obligations on transport providers, many disabled people lacked awareness of the levels of service they could expect from transport providers and the complaints and enforcement procedures available for addressing poor service.\nImproved staff awareness, respondents called for a greater understanding by transport staff of the needs of disabled people (including less visible disabilities).\nBetter enforcement of statutory regulations, for example, the carriage of assistance dogs in taxis and private hire vehicles.\nMore information on service accessibility, including more information on the accessibility of transport infrastructure and vehicles to help plan journeys, and real time alerts on the availability of related services, including lifts or accessible toilets.\nHigher provision of reliable accessible infrastructure, ranging from less cluttered pavements to more Access for All rail infrastructure.\nStaffing on the railway, where many respondents stated that visibility of staff on the railway was an important function for disabled people travelling by rail.\n2.16 In parallel to this Strategy, the Department has also published a summary of the feedback received to the AAP consultation, titled \u2018Draft Accessibility Action Plan Consultation: Summary of Responses\u2019. The feedback gathered through the consultation has contributed to the development of this Strategy.\nStructure of the Inclusive Transport Strategy\n2.17 Drawing on consultation responses, we have identified five core areas we need to address in order to achieve our goal of delivering equal access to transport for all.\n2.18 The structure of this Strategy is therefore based around the following themes:\nStaff training. We will work with transport regulators and providers to ensure that transport staff (frontline and managerial) have greater understanding of the needs of disabled people and can provide better assistance.\nAwareness and enforcement of passenger rights. We will raise awareness of the obligations on transport operators, the processes for raising concerns or complaints and work with regulators to ensure appropriate penalties - which can include fines or use of enforcement powers set out in legislation - are applied.\nImproving information. We will take steps to ensure that transport providers improve the provision of travel information in formats that all passengers can access and understand, both before and during a journey, thereby improving confidence to travel.\nImproving physical infrastructure. We will work with transport providers, transport professionals and Local Authorities to ensure that vehicles, stations and streetscapes are designed, built and operated so that they are inclusive and easy to use for disabled people.\nThe future of inclusive transport. We will use our role as Government to ensure that technological advances and new business models provide opportunities for all, and are designed from the outset through dialogue with disabled people as well as consider future demographic change.\n2.19 The Inclusive Transport Strategy is therefore structured as follows:\nIntroduction and policy context\nRecent developments and funding\nOutline disabled passenger rights and the services they can expect to receive in each mode of transport.\nThemed chapters setting out detailed actions and policies\nMonitoring, evaluation and governance arrangements for the Strategy.\n3. Recent developments\n3.1 This Government has made significant improvements over the past few years to support disabled people to become more independent. Whilst we acknowledge that there are still many areas where further work is needed to make the transport system fully accessible, we have kick-started a process of ongoing change, as set out in the following sections.\nFunding\n3.2 The Government has invested heavily in supporting disabled people, both by improving transport accessibility, and more widely. Some examples of recent expenditure that has been used to support improved access for disabled people are shown below.\nTransport expenditure\nAccess for All: Funded by DfT and delivered largely by Network Rail. Since the programme was launched in 2006, more than \u00a3500m has been invested to deliver accessible routes, including step free access, at over 200 stations. A further 1500 stations have also benefitted from smaller scale access improvements. In addition we will be making up to \u00a3300m available to extend the programme until at least 2024.\nand delivered largely by Network Rail. Since the programme was launched in 2006, more than \u00a3500m has been invested to deliver accessible routes, including step free access, at over 200 stations. A further 1500 stations have also benefitted from smaller scale access improvements. In addition we will be making up to \u00a3300m available to extend the programme until at least 2024. Rail industry access improvements: Whenever the industry installs, replaces or renews infrastructure work at stations it must meet current accessibility standards.\nStation improvement funds: All of the work carried out using funds which have been provided by the Department to improve existing stations or build new stations must also meet these standards. These funds have included the National Station Improvement Programme, the Station Commercial Project Facility and the New Stations Fund.\nThrough rail franchises: Train operators\u2019 franchise agreements include requirements for them to fund improvements at stations, which in some cases are focussed on improving the accessibility of a station (PDF, 5,842KB). Examples of funds which have been used to do this include the Minor Works Budget, the Station Improvement Fund and the Customer and Community Investment Scheme.\nCommunity Bus Fund: This \u00a325m fund allowed community transport operators, who meet the necessary criteria, to bid for a new minibus to replace or expand their existing fleet.\nMajor projects: the Department has funded a number of major projects which incorporate accessibility improvements, such as the redevelopment of London Bridge station, and the Crossrail project. All Crossrail stations will be step-free, and Crossrail trains will meet the latest accessibility standards.\nHS2: HS2 Ltd has committed to delivering inclusive design in the widest context, so that all considerations and plans (booking and planning a route, arriving at and navigating around the station as well as undertaking the journey itself) are based on engagement with disabled people. These design principles represent a commitment to futureproofing HS2\u2019s trains against the changing needs of future passengers and technological advances in facilities.\nMobility Centres: the Department provides funding to contribute to the running of 13 Mobility Centres in England, which provide a range of mobility assessments and advice. Funding has increased from less than \u00a33m in 2010/11 to nearly \u00a35.5m in 2018/19.\nResearch: the Department has carried out a range of research projects on accessibility, including through the Transport Technology Research and Innovation Grant scheme \u2013 these projects totalled around \u00a3220,000 between 2015/16 and 2018/19.\nInnovation competitions: In September 2017, the Department launched two innovation competitions, valued at \u00a3600,000 and run by the Rail Safety and Standards Board. We sought solutions where challenges remain (especially for those with mental, cognitive and developmental impairments) and where cost-savings could be made. These competitions create opportunities to target innovation funds towards developing low-cost solutions where traditional solutions have proved prohibitively expensive.\nSmall Business Research Initiative on Dementia: In 2017 the Department provided funding of \u00a3120,000 for a project with the Welsh Government to produce a dementia-friendly app to assist people who experience high levels of anxiety when travelling to and from hospital appointments.\nTotal Transport Fund: In 2015 the Government announced \u00a38m of funding for this programme which provided funding to 38 local authorities to explore the feasibility of better integration of transport and services, including of non-emergency patient transport with tendered local bus services.\nConcessionary fares: Local Authorities have a statutory obligation to provide free off-peak travel for older and disabled people on all local buses, as well as the powers to offer additional local concessions. In 2016/17, over \u00a31 billion was spent by Local Authorities in England on statutory and discretionary concessions for 9.8 million disabled and older travel pass holders (with the number of disabled holders showing a 23% increase in the last six years).\nWider Government expenditure\n3.3 Examples of expenditure by other Government Departments include:\nPersonal Independence Payment ( PIP ): the Department for Work and Pensions\u2019 ( DWP \u2019s) scheme to help individuals with the extra costs associated with long-term ill health and disability. One part of the payment is for \u2018Mobility\u2019, and is based on an individual\u2019s ability to get around. We estimate that In 2017/18 Government spent roughly \u00a32.5 billion on mobility awards, which could include provisions towards Motability vehicles.\n): the Department for Work and Pensions\u2019 ( \u2019s) scheme to help individuals with the extra costs associated with long-term ill health and disability.

Access to Work ( AtW ): Currently, DWP provides Access to Work payments to support people whose ill health or impairment would make it hard to do their job without additional workplace or related adjustment. In terms of transport, payments can include provision for taxi and PHV fares if accessible public transport is not available locally, or support workers to assist an individual on their journey.

Over \u00a3250m has been spent on transport related payments since 2010. Action with Communities in Rural England ( ACRE ): The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs ( DEFRA ) is the sponsor for the ACRE Grant in Aid Investment Programme. The ACRE Network of 38 community-based charities uses direct funding from DEFRA and other sources to help deliver rural community projects, including helping people with ill-health reach hospitals accessibly, and transporting older people at risk of isolation. Since 2012, over \u00a31.4 million of DEFRA \u2019s grant has been invested in transport projects supported by ACRE and the Network.\nRecent developments\n3.4 As a result of the Government\u2019s action and investment, we have seen many developments in recent years that will improve the travelling experience for disabled people, including:\nIn 2016 those with a mobility difficulty made an average of 603 trips per person per year [footnote 13] , an increase of 5.9% compared to 2014 (569 trips per person per year);\n, an increase of 5.9% compared to 2014 (569 trips per person per year); 98% [footnote 14] of buses in England in 2016/17 are compliant with the Public Service Vehicle Accessibility Regulations, up from 28% in 2004/05;\nof buses in England in 2016/17 are compliant with the Public Service Vehicle Accessibility Regulations, up from 28% in 2004/05; 78% [footnote 15] of the mainline rail fleet is compliant with modern accessibility standards, up from 42% in 2008;\nof the mainline rail fleet is compliant with modern accessibility standards, up from 42% in 2008; 58% [footnote 16] of taxis in England in 2017 are wheelchair accessible;\nof taxis in England in 2017 are wheelchair accessible; 1.2 million vehicles were in the disabled tax class [footnote 17] , which was 3% of all licensed vehicles, at the end of 2017;\n, which was 3% of all licensed vehicles, at the end of 2017; Since 2006, more than 200 stations have had accessible step free routes installed under Access for All. This is in addition to access improvements delivered by the industry or as part of other major projects. In addition, 75% of rail journeys are now through step-free stations. This compares with only 50% in 2005\n2.38m [footnote 18] Blue Badges were held in England as at 31 March 2017, up 0.2% on the previous year.\nBlue Badges were held in England as at 31 March 2017, up 0.2% on the previous year.

The Merchant Shipping (Passengers\u2019 Rights) Regulations 2013 came into force on 27 March 2013; Delivered improvements for disabled passengers at airports. The Civil Aviation Authority launched in 2015/16 a new Airport Accessibility reporting process in a bid to drive up improvements for disabled passengers. A performance framework was developed in conjunction with industry and disability groups and evaluates the airport against a number of criteria including the passenger assistance service, customer satisfaction levels and how much consultation the airports have undertaken with organisations who represent those with disabilities. The report highlights those airports that are falling below what government would consider acceptable when offering assistance to passengers. This has been a key driver in improving standards for disabled passengers;\nProvided support to carers through the availability of the Disabled Persons\u2019 Rail Card and the companion\u2019s bus pass - a concession offered to disabled pass-holders who are unable to travel unassisted - which is available in over half of local authorities.\n4. Overview of current rights and future improvements\n4.1 The Inclusive Transport Strategy will deliver genuine change for all travellers. In later sections we set out in detail the actions we will be taking, grouped by the main themes appearing from responses to the draft AAP consultation. In this section we summarise the current situation in each of the main modes of transport and provide a summary of the changes that the Strategy will help deliver.\n4.2 Annex B to the Strategy includes a detailed table summarising the rights disabled passengers have in each mode of transport, the service they can expect to receive, and how to complain if they do not receive the required level of service.\nRail\n4.3 Train and station operators are required via their licence to establish and comply with a Disabled People\u2019s Protection Policy ( DPPP ) that is approved by the Office for Rail and Road ( ORR ). A DPPP sets out, amongst other things, the arrangements and assistance that an operator will provide to protect the interests of disabled people using its services and to facilitate such use. Where serious or systemic problems are identified through monitoring complaints and data, ORR intervenes through a staged approach to compliance, ranging from initial discussions via requests to take rectifying action through to formal enforcement via the powers set out in the 1993 Railways Act. The ORR \u2019s annual publication \u2018Measuring Up\u2019 sets out in more detail the action it has taken to ensure ongoing compliance with operators\u2019 DPPPs .\n4.4 The ORR is currently undertaking a review of the 2009 DPPP guidance and carefully considering the case for targeted changes to deliver improvements in assisted travel, including enhancing the current monitoring regime to ensure train and station operators continue to meet their obligations to passengers that require assistance. The ORR has set up an Assisted Travel Advisory Group, representing disability groups, train and station operators, passenger champions, government and devolved administrations to advise on this work. A consultation on draft revised guidance is planned for September 2018, with the completed guidance to be published by the end of the year. The outcome of that review will determine whether some of the commitments in this Strategy will be required as a licence condition or through the franchise process in the longer term.\n4.5 This Strategy will help ensure that rail passengers with accessibility requirements will be confident to travel, able to plan their journey and familiarise themselves with the route in advance. They will be well informed about the support available, including through the Passenger Assist scheme, and able to access it easily. All rail staff will be fully trained in disability awareness and confident to support passengers whatever their needs.\n4.6 More rail journeys will be through step-free routes and all passenger trains will be accessible. Where support is pre-booked through Passenger Assist, a reliable service will be provided - and where that does not happen, passengers will receive compensation. We are working with industry and consumer groups to support the establishment of a Rail Ombudsman to investigate unresolved customer complaints and issue decisions that are binding on the industry.\nBuses\n4.7 Buses designed to carry over twenty two passengers on local and scheduled routes must comply with the Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations ( PSVAR ), and coaches will be required to comply with these Regulations from 2020.\n4.8 Responsibility for enforcing compliance with PSVAR rests with the Driver and Vehicles Standards Agency ( DVSA ) and the Office of the Traffic Commissioner ( OTC ).\n4.9 Under the Public Service Vehicles (Conduct of Drivers, Inspectors, Conductors and Passengers) Regulations 1990 (the \u201cConduct Regulations\u201d) drivers of public service vehicles must provide disabled passengers with certain types of assistance. In summary, they must:\nDeploy a boarding ramp or lift when it is required by a wheelchair user to board or alight the vehicle;\nProvide wheelchair users with assistance to board or alight the vehicle if they require it;\nOffer to provide wheelchair users with assistance in using wheelchair user restraint systems on vehicles; and\nProvide disabled passengers, who do not use wheelchairs, with assistance in boarding and alighting the vehicle if they require it.\n4.10 In addition bus operators are subject to Section 20 of the Equality Act 2010 which requires service providers to make reasonable adjustments to enable disabled people to access their services. Only the Courts can determine definitively what action constitutes a \u201creasonable adjustment\u201d. In January 2017 the Supreme Court clarified the law as it affects access to the wheelchair space for wheelchair users, ruling that drivers must do more than simply request other passengers vacate the space when it is required by a wheelchair user.\n4.11 Disabled passengers also have certain statutory rights under other legislation, including:\nTo be charged the same fare as other passengers (except when covered by a concessionary permit);\nNot to be refused carriage or to be sold a ticket, unless it is physically impossible to board the passenger or would be contrary to health and safety legislation;\nFor public facing staff, including drivers, to be trained in disability awareness;\nFor damaged mobility aids to be replaced or fixed; and\nFor specified forms of assistance to be provided at bus termini that meet certain criteria, notably Victoria Coach Station in London and Birmingham Coach Station.\n4.12 Local Transport Authorities ( LTAs ) are generally responsible for roadside infrastructure supporting bus services, including bus stations and stops, and passengers should contact the relevant authority if facilities are insufficiently accessible to meet their needs. In undertaking their activities LTAs and other public bodies are subject to the Equality Act 2010 Public Sector Equality Duty ( PSED ) and the duty to make reasonable adjustments.\n4.13 In England the statutory bus concession provides eligible older and disabled people with free off peak local bus travel. Eligibility for the concession is on the basis of criteria enshrined in legislation. People who think they may meet the criteria should contact their local authority for further information on how to apply. Concessionary travel is a devolved policy area and available concessions in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are a matter for the respective devolved administrations.\n4.14 Local buses already provide a service which is relied upon by millions of disabled people. The majority of vehicles incorporate a wheelchair space, boarding ramps or lifts, priority seating and other features to make travelling easier for disabled passengers; many drivers already receive disability awareness training; and a growing number of operators are seeing the benefit of providing accessible information on their buses.\n4.15 This Strategy will help ensure that the accessibility of buses, staff interactions and the availability of information should all become more consistent. In particular:\nDisabled people will be able to board a bus with confidence that it will meet their needs, and with confidence that drivers will respond appropriately to their needs, or be willing to assist when required.\nAlmost every bus in Great Britain will have audible and visible next stop and route announcements, meaning that passengers can travel with confidence that they will know when to alight when their stop is reached.\nWe will have a clearer understanding of how accessible bus stops and stations are across the country, and Local Transport Authorities will have the knowledge necessary to ensure that new and upgraded facilities meet the needs of their users.\nDisabled people will be better able to plan their journeys, as information on the accessibility of bus services becomes more widely available and more accessible, enabling all passengers to make informed journey decisions.\nWheelchair users facing problems accessing buses will be able to report issues using a new online tool.\n4.16 In the longer term we want all passengers to be able to plan journeys which meet their needs as easily as non-disabled passengers do at present; we want accessibility standards on buses to keep pace with the evolving needs of disabled people and the mobility aids they use; and we want bus stations and stops to meet basic accessibility standards, ensuring that disabled passengers can board and alight where they want to. These steps will take longer to achieve, but they will be necessary for ensuring that bus services continue to meet the needs of those who rely upon them.\nTaxis and Private Hire Vehicles\n4.17 Taxis and Private Hire Vehicles ( PHVs ) play an essential role in enabling disabled people to complete door-to-door journeys where other forms of transport may not be available or accessible. Vehicles and drivers are licensed by local licensing authorities (LLAs) which have broad powers to shape the service provided within their jurisdiction.\n4.18 Disabled passengers travelling by taxi or PHV have a number of rights, including:\nSection 20 of the Equality Act 2010, which requires service providers to make reasonable adjustments to enable them to access their services;\nSection 165 of the Equality Act 2010, which requires non-exempt drivers of taxis and PHVs designated as wheelchair accessible to accept the carriage of wheelchair users, to provide them with appropriate assistance, and to refrain from charging them more than other passengers would pay for the same service; and\ndesignated as wheelchair accessible to accept the carriage of wheelchair users, to provide them with appropriate assistance, and to refrain from charging them more than other passengers would pay for the same service; and Sections 168 and 170 of the Equality Act 2010, which requires non-exempt drivers of taxis and PHVs to accept the carriage of assistance dogs and to refrain from charging extra for them.\n4.19 Around 58% of vehicles are already wheelchair accessible, but these tend to be concentrated in urban locations and taxi fleets. The proportion of wheelchair accessible PHVs remains very low, at about 2% nationally.\n4.20 This Strategy should help ensure that authorities not only use the powers available to them to ensure that taxi and PHV services not only comply with the legal requirements but that these services meet the needs of passengers more consistently.\n4.21 In the longer term we want the service currently provided by taxis and PHVs to be as accessible to disabled passengers as it is for those who are not disabled. This should mean not only that vehicles are sufficiently accessible to provide for people with a range of access needs, but that the means of hiring them is accessible, that passengers can be picked up or dropped off at a location convenient to them, and that no disabled person is ever left at the kerbside or charged extra for their journey. We also want LLAs to understand their role in helping this to happen, both through the licensing system and through other areas of influence, such as traffic management.\nPersonal mobility\nBlue Badge scheme\n4.22 If you are driving and you have a medical condition or disability, you must inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency ( DVLA ). Further information is available via the DVLA website. The Blue Badge scheme, administered by local councils, exists to help those that have mobility problems park closer to their destination. Blue Badges can be applied for online via gov.uk webpage or contact your local council directly.\nThe Motability Scheme\n4.23 The Motability Scheme can help those in receipt of a qualifying benefit with leasing a car, powered wheelchair or scooter. The Department for Work and Pensions ( DWP ) is responsible for the disability benefits that provide a passport to The Motability Scheme. While DWP works closely with Motability, it is an independent charitable organisation that is wholly responsible for the terms and the administration of the Scheme itself.\n4.24 This Strategy will help ensure that when driving, or as a passenger in a car, a disabled person will be able to expect suitable toilets and changing facilities at most motorway service areas and along many long distance journeys. If using their own or a carer\u2019s car, they will be able to park more easily. If using a travel service, autonomous vehicle or vehicle share scheme, they will have access to a vehicle suitable to their needs.\n4.25 If travelling to a hospital, a disabled person should have a route from their home to the hospital that is accessible without the need for a car.\nPedestrian environment\n4.26 Local authorities are responsible for the design of their streets. It is for them to ensure any pedestrian environment scheme, including a shared space, is inclusive and that they meet the requirements of the Equality Act 2010.\n4.27 We will consider ways to help them understand their duties, and ensure they have the skills needed to deliver inclusive pedestrian environments. We will also make clear to authorities that proper engagement with all road users, at an early stage of scheme development, must be carried out to enable concerns to be raised and acted on effectively.\n4.28 This Strategy should help ensure that disabled people are able to move around freely through the pedestrian environment, and use it to access other modes of transport. If using a cycle, whether as a mobility aid or not, they will be able to use inclusive cycle infrastructure to support their journey.\nMaritime\n4.29 Maritime passenger rights entitle passengers to a percentage cost reimbursement where they are delayed, subject to conditions and exceptions. Disabled passengers and passengers with reduced mobility are entitled to:\nAcceptance for carriage unless safety reasons justify refusal;\nFree assistance in ports to embark, disembark and on board vessels but not caring functions;\nAssistance from staff who have been trained to understand the needs of disabled people;\nAssistance dogs will be carried subject to national pet regulations;\nMedical and mobility equipment will be allowed on board that is reasonable for the voyage.\nPorts and vessels must be fully accessible but there is no retrofitting requirement so it will take time for all facilities to be compliant.\n4.30 This Strategy will help ensure that disabled and reduced mobility passengers will receive a level of service that enables them to travel safely to the maximum number of destinations possible. The Department will highlight examples of good practice in the sector.\nAviation\n4.31 Everyone deserves the right to travel with comfort and dignity, which is why we are looking at measures to improve accessibility at airports and on aircraft. Disabled passengers already have statutory rights when travelling by air. But we recognise that more can still be done to give disabled people the confidence to travel by air.\n4.32 Aviation passenger rights provide that assistance suitable to the passenger\u2019s needs must be provided without any cost to the passenger at the airport as well as on board the aircraft. This includes, but is not limited to:\nAssistance at check-in and with baggage;\nHelp storing and retrieving baggage;\nSupport throughout the immigration, customs and security procedures;\nMoving to the toilet facilities if required;\nTransport of up to two pieces of mobility equipment in addition to medical equipment.\n4.33 The legislation also requires that a designated complaints body is in place to deal with any alleged infringement of the Regulation.\n4.34 As part of our Aviation Strategy, we will be working to understand more about the barriers that currently exist for passengers with reduced mobility and disabilities and working with the industry to remove these obstacles. We will work closely with industry to make improvements and will consult on all possible measures before publishing our final Aviation Strategy in mid-2019. This will build on the important work of the Civil Aviation Authority, which has stepped up its compliance activity and efforts to highlight which airports are offering exemplary assistance to passengers and which airports are falling below standards.\n5. Awareness and enforcement of passenger rights\nWe would like stronger signposting to where older and disabled people can take complaints and suggestions. We have received feedback that some older people don\u2019t bother to make complaints because they think it\u2019s a waste of time and they will not receive a response from the operator. Age UK The general sense is that the various complaint mechanisms across different modes are passive - in that they are ready to receive complaints if people bring their complaints \u2013 rather that proactive. This assumes that consumers have a level of understanding of their rights\u2026and a level of awareness of, and confidence in, complaint systems that we believe does not exist. DPTAC\n5.1 Providing timely and high quality assistance services to disabled travellers, including those with less visible disabilities, is vital to ensure disabled people can travel with confidence. The draft AAP consultation revealed that many disabled passengers were unaware of their rights to assistance and what steps they could take to enforce those rights, should they receive a poor service from transport providers. It was also revealed that the consistency of enforcement procedures across the different modes of transport could be improved.\n5.2 The rights of disabled passengers across all modes of transport, as well as the related complaints procedures, are set out in chapter 4 (and Annex B). We consider it essential that the lack of knowledge of passenger rights is addressed and commit to taking clear steps through this Strategy to raise awareness. We will also strengthen enforcement mechanisms so that disabled people can have confidence that action will be taken on non-compliance.\n5.3 The legislative framework governing passenger rights is set out in Part 12 of the Equality Act 2010, which covers taxis, buses and coaches, and trains. In addition, the Equality Act also places a duty on providers to make reasonable adjustments in order to avoid a disabled person being placed at a \u2018substantial disadvantage\u2019 when accessing services and facilities. The determination of \u2018reasonable adjustment\u2019 is made by transport providers and operators but such decisions are challengeable in the Courts. In addition, disabled passengers also have specific rights under various other European Union ( EU ) and UK regulations.\n5.4 Whilst the legal obligations placed upon operators vary across the different modes of transport, there is a clear role for Government in actively monitoring and ensuring compliance with legislation. We will publish data received from regulators or relevant authorities on the number of complaints received from disabled people with respect to their journeys. By 2020, we will take steps to ensure that passengers have clear avenues to pursue claims of poor service and that regulators consistently enforce the law.\nCase study: Securing passenger improvements through regulatory enforcement Through its accessibility performance framework for airports, the Civil Aviation Authority ( CAA ) identified substantive issues with the quality of the assistance service provided at Heathrow Airport. In the CAA \u2019s 2016/17 airport accessibility report (PDF, 375KB) Heathrow was rated as \u2018poor\u2019. Disabled passengers and persons with reduced mobility ( PRM s) had been subjected to regular breaks in the assistance service, resulting in people being left in \u2018holding areas\u2019, meaning that it was taking significantly longer for those requiring assistance to exit the airport than other passengers. The CAA has civil powers under the Access to Air Travel Regulations (PDF, 82KB). Under these powers, the CAA secured Heathrow Airport\u2019s commitment that it would develop and implement a performance improvement plan to ensure that it is able to provide a consistent and high quality assistance service. The performance improvement plan included commitments to eradicate breaks in the service and improve the speed at which passengers using the assistance service were moved through the airport, to set up a comprehensive disability awareness programme, to improve oversight by Heathrow management of its contractor, Omniserv, and to consult with organisations and groups representing disabled people. The CAA is pleased with Heathrow Airport\u2019s progress in taking forward the commitments made in its improvement plan. The airport has removed all \u2018holding areas\u2019 for passengers using the assistance service and waiting times have been greatly reduced. Staff training has been enhanced and accredited by Disability Rights UK and the airport has set up the Heathrow Access Advisory Group, which provides regular and effective advice to Heathrow on accessibility issues at the airport. In addition, customer satisfaction scores at the airport have improved significantly. Heathrow have now received a \u2018good\u2019 rating in this year\u2019s CAA report (PDF, 177KB).\nCase Study: Blackpool Transport and customer complaints Historically, Blackpool Transport ( BTS ) placed very little emphasis on customer needs and experience within their operations. Complaints were not used as an opportunity to learn from mistakes and improve, and consequently inclusivity was merely touched upon when considered. Since then, BTS has drastically changed its approach from being task centred to now being customer centred. One of the ways they believe they have improved is through their Customer Experience Strategy, a component of their five-year business plan. The Strategy planned to use customer feedback to improve many aspects of the business, from cleanliness of vehicles to the format of signage. BTS established \u2018customer hubs\u2019 (local community gathering points staffed by BTS staff) as a way to approach customers, through these interactions it gathered complaints and feedback on its services and explored with passengers ways to remediate areas of concerns. Following the introduction of these changes, BTS has seen an increase in customer satisfaction in its services and its business model has also been adopted across the bus industry.\nActions to deliver our objectives\nAwareness of passenger rights\n5.5 To improve awareness of passenger rights, we will:\nIn 2019, launch a public awareness campaign, working with a wide range of partners, including DPTAC , to promote ways of positively interacting with disabled people in order to ensure a supportive travelling experience and reduce instances of disability related hate crime on transport;\n, to promote ways of positively interacting with disabled people in order to ensure a supportive travelling experience and reduce instances of disability related hate crime on transport; Continue to work with passenger and industry representative bodies[footnote 22] and support the work of regulators to encourage greater promotion of information about the rights of disabled travellers and what they are entitled to expect in terms of service and facilities, as well as developing easier ways to register complaints when things go wrong.\nBuses:\nBy spring 2019, release the first iteration of an online tool to assist disabled people in reporting issues they encounter when travelling by bus. This will initially focus on passengers who use ramps and lifts when boarding buses, but may be capable of being extended to cover other categories of access issue or transport mode, depending upon the impact of this pilot project. Enforcement action will be taken by the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency ( DVSA ) and, where appropriate, the Office for the Traffic Commissioner against non-compliant bus operators.\nEnforcement\n5.6 To ensure passengers\u2019 rights are better enforced and regulated, we will:\nRail:\nBy the end of 2018, support the establishment of a Rail Ombudsman to investigate and rule on unresolved customer complaints (including on the provision of assistance and access to advertised accessibility facilities), with the power to issue decisions that are binding on the industry;\nBy the end of 2018, use the tendering process for new rail franchises to require a minimum target for the successful completion of booked assistance through the Passenger Assist scheme, to incentivise the provision of a more reliable service. We will ensure that train operators who fail to deliver the assistance booked will provide financial compensation to passengers;\nFrom 2019, introduce new accessibility requirements mandating all train operators running new franchises to write to the Secretary of State for Transport (copied to the Transport Accessibility Minister) on an annual basis outlining all activity that has been conducted to improve accessibility for rail passengers, including what they have done beyond the obligations in their franchise agreements and setting out steps they will take to increase any poor performance in their provision of the Passenger Assist scheme. The Department will publish these letters to ensure transparency and to share best practice;\nBy end of 2019, work with the ORR as it reviews the current Disabled People\u2019s Protection Policy guidance and considers how the requirements it contains are to be monitored.\nBuses:\nBy spring 2019, develop a monitoring and enforcement framework for mandatory bus driver disability awareness training, which will include identifying a body to ensure compliance by bus operators with legal requirements;\nSupport the DVSA in its activities to incentivise prompt compliance by bus operators with the Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations ( PSVAR ) and to take decisive action where this does not happen. We will report regularly on DVSA \u2019s enforcement activities;\nin its activities to incentivise prompt compliance by bus operators with the Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations ( ) and to take decisive action where this does not happen. We will report regularly on \u2019s enforcement activities; By the end of 2018, after further engagement with affected stakeholders, announce the specific actions we intend to take to secure access to the wheelchair space for those who need it. This follows the Supreme Court\u2019s 2017 ruling in the case of First Group PLC vs Paulley, requiring bus drivers to do more than simply request passengers vacate the wheelchair space when it is required by a wheelchair user. An expert stakeholder group was established following the judgement, and advised Ministers that a combined approach, amending legislation and guidance, and seeking to influence passenger behaviour, should be used to secure access to the space for those who need it[footnote 23].\nTaxis/ PHVs :\nBy end of 2019, publish for consultation revised best practice guidance to support local licensing authorities (LLAs) to use their existing powers more effectively. In particular we will recommend that authorities require taxi and private hire vehicle ( PHV ) drivers to complete disability awareness and equality training, make it simple to report discrimination and take robust action against drivers alleged to have discriminated against disabled passengers. Consulting on best practice guidance for taxi and PHV licensing, authorities will provide an opportunity to further the discussion with the Local Government Association and other representative organisations around potential approaches for ensuring that licensing authorities use the powers available to them, and take robust action against drivers who have discriminated illegally against disabled passengers;\n) drivers to complete disability awareness and equality training, make it simple to report discrimination and take robust action against drivers alleged to have discriminated against disabled passengers. Consulting on best practice guidance for taxi and licensing, authorities will provide an opportunity to further the discussion with the Local Government Association and other representative organisations around potential approaches for ensuring that licensing authorities use the powers available to them, and take robust action against drivers who have discriminated illegally against disabled passengers; Take steps to understand why taxi and PHV drivers continue to refuse to transport assistance dogs. For over a decade it has been illegal for drivers of taxis and PHVs to refuse the carriage of an assistance dog. Even where enforcement of this requirement is rigorous, such as in London, we understand anecdotally that refusal incidents continue to happen. We will undertake research to identify why the risk of fines and the loss of a driver\u2019s licence appear insufficient in some circumstances to prevent them from discriminating against assistance dog owners. We will use evidence from this work to support any further action that we may take in this area to ensure that assistance dog owners are able to travel by taxi and PHV free from the fear of discrimination.\nMaritime:\nFrom Autumn 2018, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency will undertake a dedicated survey of disabled passengers using ferries and cruise ships in order to effectively measure the services provided;\nBy the end of 2019, we will review the Maritime and Coastguard Agency\u2019s enforcement of regulation, particularly around staff training (which was a concern raised through the Accessibility Action Plan consultation) and work with them to strengthen procedures where areas for improvement are identified.\nAviation:\nBy 2019, review the powers the Civil Aviation Authority ( CAA ) has to enforce regulations and strengthen them if evidence suggests this is required;\n) has to enforce regulations and strengthen them if evidence suggests this is required; Work with the CAA to review performance standards for airports and airlines, such as the length of time taken for a passenger to receive assistance boarding and leaving aircraft.

Staff training\nStaff training should involve talking directly to disabled people themselves so that staff gain a better understanding and empathy for the day-to-day problems they encounter on the transport system\u201d. Age UK Our members have reported issues with how transport staff handle disabled passengers. Transport users with [less visible] disabilities often find their usage of disabled seats questioned and the level of understanding varies amongst staff which is why compulsory training is necessary. UNISON Often when disabled people\u2019s needs are not met when using public transport, it\u2019s the process of customer service that\u2019s at fault rather than a funding issue. All Party Parliamentary Group for Young Disabled People\n6.1 For disabled people, the service and assistance provided by transport staff is vital to their travelling experience. Negative experiences can leave people lacking the confidence to use the transport system which can in turn have a profound impact on their quality of life. It can lead to feelings of social isolation which can have an impact on other physical and mental health conditions.\n6.2 Providing effective training to transport staff is one of the best ways to improve the travelling experience of disabled passengers. Positive interactions with staff can help build the confidence of disabled people to travel. Not only is good staff training important for raising awareness of the needs of disabled people, it is also essential as a way to ensure transport staff are aware of their own legal obligations.\nResponses to the Accessibility Action Plan consultation\n6.3 During the draft Accessibility Action Plan consultation in 2017, we received a number of responses highlighting the importance of the assistance and support provided by transport staff. We also met frontline transport staff who made us aware of the difference made to their organisation\u2019s training programme when senior managers also undertook disability equality awareness training or met with disabled people. Draft AAP consultation respondents highlighted that greater senior level disability awareness helped to ensure that budgets, training and resources were directed into the areas and services which helped provide the greatest improvements to the experience of disabled or older passengers.\nCase Study: Brighton and Hove buses and metrobus \u2018My Guide\u2019, developed by Guide Dogs, has been specially adapted for bus travel in partnership with Brighton and Hove Buses and Metrobus. This practical training equips bus staff with the knowledge, skills and confidence to safely guide people with sight loss. Victoria Garcia, Accessibility Officer for Brighton and Hove Buses and Metrobus explained \u201cDrivers are blindfolded and then asked to try and board the bus. Using this approach increases empathy and understanding and we\u2019ve had some amazing feedback from colleagues who have completed the course.\u201d Martin Harris, Managing Director, added that \u201cThis type of training is essential as it increases staff\u2019s awareness which helps all our customers and not just those with sight loss. I can attest to the value of this training having personally undertaken it.\u201d Feedback from Brighton and Hove Bus drivers included comments such as: I had no idea how scary it was not being able to see. This was the best training I\u2019ve ever had. Every driver in the UK should do this course\nInclusive Transport Accreditation Scheme\n6.4 The Government wants transport operators to provide all staff (frontline and back-office, including senior managers) with training on disability equality and awareness as well as an understanding of the range of conditions and impairments affecting disabled people, and to involve disabled people in the provision of that training. We also want to see providers highlight to staff the importance of good customer service to enabling disabled passengers to travel confidently.\n6.5 In 2019, we will develop and launch an Inclusive Transport Accreditation Scheme to allow the best transport operators to receive formal recognition for the positive actions they are taking to improve disabled passengers\u2019 experiences of using the transport system, and to encourage others to follow suit.\n6.6 In order to qualify for one of our multiple accreditation statuses, companies will need to satisfy the Department that they have displayed a number of desired characteristics, such as:\nCommitted to train all staff, from back office to front line, on the equality and disability awareness package we are developing;\nMade clear public pledges on what steps they will take to improve their service for disabled people;\nOffered assistance cards, where appropriate, to disabled passengers; and\nEnsured that their staff are able to respond appropriately when assistance cards are presented by disabled people;\nBecome a Disability Confident employer.\n6.7 The Department has already had considerable interest in the scheme from companies including London Stansted Airport, Southeastern and the British Ports Association, and is confident that this scheme will help raise standards across the sector.\nActions to deliver our objectives:\n6.8 In order to improve the service provided to disabled people, by 2020 we will:\nLead the way, by providing disability equality and awareness training for Department for Transport staff as part of our staff development programmes;\nRaise awareness amongst DfT staff on how the Public Sector Equality Duty, and the needs of people with protected characteristics, should be considered as part of transport policy development and delivery. This will include through staff training, the creation of an Equality Leaders Scheme to drive change across the Department, and steps to ensure equality considerations are made explicit to decision makers such as Senior Civil Servants and Ministers.\nstaff on how the Public Sector Equality Duty, and the needs of people with protected characteristics, should be considered as part of transport policy development and delivery. This will include through staff training, the creation of an Equality Leaders Scheme to drive change across the Department, and steps to ensure equality considerations are made explicit to decision makers such as Senior Civil Servants and Ministers. Develop a disability equality and awareness training package that can be made available across modes to all transport operators;\nDevelop an accreditation scheme to incentivise operators to use the disability equality and awareness training package, publicly sign up to commitments to improve inclusivity, and to become Disability Confident employers;\nRecommend, or where appropriate require, that transport operators and regulators involve disabled people or representative organisations wherever possible in the training received by staff (i.e. transport operators should ensure that the course content is informed by the lived experience of disabled people, relevant to the transport mode concerned).\nRail:\nBy the end of 2018, include a section focused entirely on accessibility in franchise competitions which will require bidders to commit to providing enhanced disability awareness training for staff covering a range of impairments, including less visible disabilities. Bidders must commit to involving disabled people in the design and delivery of that training, as part of the franchise tendering process;\nThrough future rail franchises, require that train operating companies should have at least one person responsible for accessibility at board level and one person at an operational level to ensure inclusive transport is embedded into the service provided.\nBuses:\nDuring 2019, publish best practice guidance for delivering training across the bus sector. This guidance will assist operators in complying with the new mandatory disability equality and awareness training requirement which came into force across the sector in March 2018.\nTaxi/ PHV :\nDo everything in our power to ensure that local licensing authorities make full use of their existing powers, including recommending that driver disability equality and awareness training be mandated in licensing policies.\nAviation:\nBuild on the work CAA has already undertaken with the aviation industry, poor performing airports, in particular, to understand the reasons why the services and assistance received by passengers using aviation are inconsistent and seek to achieve greater consistency in training between airport and airline staff (including ground staff) by 2020.\n7. Improving information and awareness\nMore needs to be done to make it [transport] more inclusive for a wider range of disabled passengers, with better information made available to people who are not able to see graphical information Guide Dogs UK\n7.1 The draft Accessibility Action Plan consultation received a number of responses highlighting the fact that clear, timely and accessible information both before and during the journey which was tailored to the needs of disabled people played an important role in giving people the confidence to travel. Consultation responses particularly focussed on the need for more accessible journey planning information as well as real-time information on the availability of assistance and services (such as toilet facilities) as being fundamental to reducing levels of anxiety and increasing confidence to travel. It was clear that a lack of information on what assistance or level of service a disabled person could expect, could put an individual off travelling at all.\n7.2 We want disabled people to have equal access to transport information and we recognise that this will mean that DfT , transport operators and regulators will need to produce information in formats which are accessible for all. Transport for London ( TfL ) have already noted this as a priority for London\u2019s transport, and they are working closely with developers to expand the accessible information they provide through, for example, partnership with app developers and increasing the number of buses with hearing loops[footnote 24].\nCreating an inclusive travelling experience\n7.3 The draft AAP consultation also highlighted the fact that increasing the confidence of disabled people to travel was not solely about improving the information provided by operators about services or assistance. Improving the travelling environment for disabled people, including at times, the attitude and behaviour of other passengers, will enable disabled people to feel confident taking journeys.\nCase Study: South Yorkshire and the 120 bus I love the talking buses on the 120 route in Sheffield. It makes things so much easier. If this was on all buses I would be able to travel a lot more independently, maybe even at night when it\u2019s dark A visually impaired user of the 120 bus.\nAudio Visual ( AV ) equipment on buses can dramatically improve the journey experience of many passengers, and for others it can be the single improvement that gives them the confidence to travel. Audible and visible information can help a range of disabled passengers to feel sufficiently confident to use buses, enabling them to access employment, education and other services, regardless of the time of day or their familiarity with the route on which they are travelling. It may be of particular benefit to people who are blind or partially sighted, or anyone who might otherwise avoid travelling at night because of the risk of alighting the bus in the wrong location.\nIn 2017, South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive ( SYPTE ) partnered with their area\u2019s two local bus operators (First and Stagecoach) to retrofit AV equipment in 37 buses along the 120 route. This installation project was funded through DfT \u2019s BSOG Reform Better Bus Area Grant, to which SYPTE had submitted a successful bid. The scheme promotes the provision of audible and visible information on-board buses ahead of the forthcoming Accessible Information Requirement ( AIR ) (where AV equipment will be mandatory for the majority of operators), which will soon be consulted on.\nWhilst the operators had concerns about how customers would react to the new \u2018talking buses\u2019, these were quickly allayed following an \u2018after implementation\u2019 survey showing a clear increase in customer satisfaction when boa"}, {"title": "Making Transport Accessible: A Guide for Individuals with Disabilities", "article": "Transportation is essential for everyone, regardless of age or ability. It allows us to go to work, school, or simply explore the world around us. However, for individuals with disabilities, transportation can be a significant challenge. The lack of accessible transportation options often results in isolation and limits the ability to fully participate in society.\nIf you\u2019re a person with a disability looking for accessible transportation options, this guide will provide you with useful information on how to make transportation work for you.\nPlan ahead: It is essential to plan your journey in advance. This includes finding the best route to your destination and making sure you have enough time to get there. Many transportation providers, such as trains and buses, offer accessible services that must be booked in advance. By planning ahead, you can ensure that you have the necessary support to make your journey as comfortable and stress-free as possible.\nKnow your rights: As a person with a disability, you have rights that protect you from discrimination in transportation. The Equality Act 2010 makes it illegal to discriminate against anyone based on their disability. It applies to all modes of transportation, including buses, trains, taxis, and private hire vehicles. If you feel that you have been discriminated against, you can file a complaint with the relevant authority.\nChoose the right mode of transportation: There are many modes of transportation available, and each one has different levels of accessibility. For short journeys, walking or using a wheelchair may be the best option. For longer journeys, trains and buses may be more convenient. When choosing a mode of transportation, consider the distance, the terrain, and your personal preferences.\nUse accessible transportation services: Many transportation providers offer accessible services that cater to the needs of people with disabilities. For example, buses and trains have wheelchair ramps and priority seating areas, and taxis may have special facilities for people with disabilities. These services must be booked in advance, so make sure to plan ahead.\nAsk for assistance: If you require assistance during your journey, don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help. Many transportation providers have trained staff who can help you get on and off the vehicle and assist you during the journey. You can also bring a companion or personal assistant to help you if you prefer.\nConsider accessible taxis and private hire vehicles: Taxis and private hire vehicles can be a convenient and accessible mode of transportation for people with disabilities. Many providers offer wheelchair-accessible vehicles and trained drivers who can assist you during your journey. It is essential to book these services in advance to ensure availability.\nUse technology to your advantage: Technology has made transportation more accessible for people with disabilities. Many transportation providers have mobile apps that allow you to plan your journey, track your vehicle, and even pay for your ticket. You can also use GPS devices to navigate unfamiliar areas and find accessible routes.\nIn conclusion, transportation is essential for people with disabilities, and there are many options available to make it accessible and convenient. By planning ahead, knowing your rights, choosing the right mode of transportation, using accessible services, asking for assistance, and using technology, you can make transportation work for you. Don\u2019t let the lack of accessible transportation options limit your ability to participate in society.

From minor annoyances to violent crimes, getting from point A to B can be fraught with risk.\nGoal 11 of the United Nations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sustainable development goals exhorts member states to provide safe, affordable, and accessible transportation for everyone, especially those who find themselves in vulnerable situations. And yet, while disparate initiatives have been launched around the world to make public commutes safer and accessible for everyone, a survey of the United Nations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and other international agencies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 research, plus our own analysis, suggests there is still more to be done across the three main stages of the commuter journey: planning and booking, the predeparture experience at boarding areas, and the travel itself.\nIn this article, we consider just how inclusive global public-transit systems are and explore ways that municipalities, urban planners, and other key stakeholders can assess and accommodate the end-to-end needs of all travelers.\nHow inclusive are our public-transit systems?\nOver the past decade, international organizations such as the United Nations have made the concerted effort to study inclusivity in urban-transport systems as a means to guarantee fair opportunities for all commuters. The insights that have come out of this endeavor fall under two broad themes.\nFirst, a collection of studies\u00e2\u0080\u0094including the UN Commission on the Status of Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Safe cities and safe public spaces for women and girls study\u00e2\u0080\u0094provide analyses of the key safety and communications issues that public-transport operators need to address. These include reducing violence and harassment on public transit, ensuring safer nighttime commutes, and providing clear, effective, around-the-clock communication between operators and travelers.\nSecond, a separate stream of research studies the main barriers that limit inclusion on public transit for women, people with disabilities, and low-income travelers, among others. Critical obstacles include, among others, poorly designed transportation, high ticket prices, inadequate safety regulations, and schedules that fail to account for the travel patterns of commuters with specific needs.\nAs they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve become aware of these issues and limitations, many public-transit system providers and urban planners have launched initiatives to address them\u00e2\u0080\u0094to limited effect, however. Such campaigns and programs have typically been introduced in an ad hoc manner rather than integrated into the overall public-transport system.\nSome cities, such as Los Angeles and Santiago, focused on surveying travel patterns of public-transit users, while others, including a major European capital and a large city in Southeast Asia, mostly worked on communication campaigns to raise awareness of nighttime safety. Other cities\u00e2\u0080\u0099 efforts were limited in scope. In Madrid, for example, on-demand bus stops were introduced on suburban routes during specific times to reduce the walking distance home for female passengers.\nFrom booking to travel: An end-to-end approach to inclusion\nShare From the inside out: Inclusion in the urban-transport workforce According to the latest Kantar Inclusion Index, less than half of transportation employees believe that their organizations are actively pursuing inclusion. In addition, the sector reports above-average workplace bullying/harassment and situations in which employees were made to feel uncomfortable. Fostering greater inclusion for public-transport employees requires providers to start with an accurate assessment of where they stand. Then, they can begin embarking on diversity, equity, and inclusion\u00c2 (DEI) transformation journeys to reshape their way of working. Diversity refers to workforce composition across various identity-related characteristics, such as gender, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, and disabilities. Equity focuses on ensuring that identity is not predictive of opportunities or workplace outcomes. Inclusion refers to the degree to which an individual feels that they can bring their authentic selves to work, enabling them to contribute in a meaningful and deliberate manner. From our experience working in this space, public-transport providers can gain DEI awareness in different ways. Sometimes targeted, eye-opening workshops aimed at uncovering deeply rooted unconscious bias represent a wake-up call for organizations: having diverse subsets of colleagues collaborate to identify unexpected biases in their ways of thinking is sometimes sufficient to trigger top-management engagement toward a new way of working. In other cases, transport agencies go even further and fully train their staff on civil-rights issues, among others, and on potential biases toward underrepresented categories. In other cases, achieving a profound understanding of the internal level of inclusivity can require more time and various sessions at all levels of the organization. Once companies agree that room for improvement exists, the journey to a fully inclusive work environment unfolds. After the first step of assessing and building the fact base through company-specific business cases, other challenging steps of the process remain: Architect (development of key performance indicators and road map): beginning with a solid awareness and understanding of the internal level of inclusion, companies develop a plan by designing a portfolio of initiatives linked to specific and tangible objectives, prioritizing them on feasibility and expected impact. The initiatives plan is complemented by the identification of pilots to be launched and tested, either on selected perimeters or on a company-wide basis.\nAct (test and learn with quick programs): companies start launching pilots and initiatives on target business units, functions, and geographies, in line with the agreed-upon implementation plan. As the plan unfolds, insights from pilots can be used to learn and refine ongoing and future initiatives.\nAdvance (build on success and track progress): in the core phase of the implementation, companies get the program to full scale. This requires a strong monitoring and accountability structure, alongside a proven knowledge codification and sharing system to constantly improve idea generation and the implementation of initiatives. Among public-transportation providers, one of the most notable programs in the past few years was launched by the roads and transport authority in a major city in the Middle East, which focused on including and elevating women\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, it created a dedicated fund for high-performing women employees and another initiative for \u00e2\u0080\u009cpeople of determination,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which included ad hoc employment and training programs.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time for urban-transport providers to draw from our collective understanding of inclusion and design and implement an urban-transport system that works for everyone. While this article focuses on the customer journey, travel providers should not miss the opportunity to transform their own organizations as well (see sidebar, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom the inside out: Inclusion in the urban-transport workforce\u00e2\u0080\u009d).\nTo further contribute to our existing understanding of travel and inclusion, we conducted our own research. We surveyed more than 20 different public-transport operators around the world and identified key requirements and initiatives for an inclusive public-transport system. We found that while there are many initiatives to enhance inclusion, they are typically not part of an integrated, 360-degree framework. We believe that a comprehensive and integrated approach to inclusive transportation comprises initiatives that fall into six categories (Exhibit 1).\n1\nWe mapped these requirements and initiatives along the commuter journey, which we broke down into three parts: the booking stage, the predeparture stage, and the actual travel experience (Exhibit 2). In each phase, there are actions travel providers can take to address specific pain points. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll explore those actions using the example of a rail-based journey\u00e2\u0080\u0094although the conceptual principles here can be applied to other forms of urban transport, such as buses and ferries.\n2\nThe booking stage\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s common nowadays for people to use navigation apps to find the most convenient route to their destination. The would-be passenger decides on the starting and arrival points, preferred mode of transport, and time of travel. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll factor in potential route disruptions (and explore alternatives, if necessary), how crowded the commute might be, and whether there are any loyalty-program benefits to be accrued.\nThis stage presents a number of potential pain points for some commuters. For instance, a wheelchair user may not know if a train station is equipped with elevators and if there are design barriers that may make it difficult to board and alight from a train.\nSome cities have tried to create a more accessible and safe experience for senior travelers. For instance, Salzburg has launched initiatives to promote the use of public transport among older people. The city has hosted \u00e2\u0080\u009cmobility days,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and pamphlets on commuter safety can be found in all train stations. Salzburg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bus drivers are also trained to be extra vigilant around older passengers, and vehicles are designed with senior citizens in mind. These initiatives have reduced accidents among older people and increased awareness among the remaining population.\nOur research points to a number of actions urban-transport providers can take at the booking and planning stage to create more inclusion. For instance, they could create pooling options in their travel apps so that passengers could choose to commute in groups. They may offer special rates at this stage as well, to disabuse people of the idea that accessible travel options are more expensive than standard ones. Passengers could also be given the option to easily share their itinerary with their friends and loved ones for an additional layer of oversight.\nTravel providers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 mobile apps may also provide a direct line of communication between the traveler and the provider and are a tool providers may want to use more strategically. Safety issues could be flagged immediately. Information about security measures, optimal travel times, and easy-access facilities could be relayed through this channel when passengers check and confirm their itinerary. The Transport for London, for instance, allows for just this with its dedicated journey planner; the app lets would-be passengers optimize their journey from the booking stage.\nPredeparture phase\nArriving at a station or terminal can be an overwhelming experience, with hordes of people crisscrossing in every possible direction\u00e2\u0080\u0094businesspeople rushing to catch their trains with barely minutes to spare, families trying to herd rowdy children toward the right platform, and buskers plying their craft.\nFor many, the predeparture phase looks like this: you receive a push notification from your travel provider with information about your train\u00e2\u0080\u0099s departure time. To get to the platform you go through a thermal-imaging scanner that checks your temperature, you make it past the turnstile with an electronic ticket, and you find the correct platform, where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll wait to board.\nFor groups or travelers with specific logistical needs, this phase can be full of hazards. If they are early for their train, for instance, such passengers may find few accessible waiting spaces to accommodate them.\nThere are a number of ways urban-travel providers can improve the predeparture experience for all travelers. They may want to integrate important safety and pooling information into the departure reminder, noting the location of accessible facilities and safe train cars\u00e2\u0080\u0094carriages with an attendant, conductor, or security officer. Visual \u00e2\u0080\u009cnudges\u00e2\u0080\u009d and cues could promote positive behaviors, such as offering assistance to people with mobility constraints or to pregnant women. In stations where longer wait times are common, more rooms for nursing mothers and a greater number of dedicated waiting areas could be created. Treating the station as a civic space by promoting community-focused activities\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as increasing retail outlets and installing open pianos\u00e2\u0080\u0094could also enhance commuters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sense of safety.\nIn 2006, the city of Graz, Austria, upgraded its key stops to make them both more accessible and livable; and, targeting both safety and comfort in its train platforms and stations, the Canadian cities of Ottawa and Toronto created designated Transecure waiting areas.\nTraveling and arriving at the destination\nThere are a number of actions travel providers can take to make passengers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 journeys inclusive once they are on board. For instance, it is possible for travelers on most trains to track their progress while en route\u00e2\u0080\u0094but it may not always be clear how to request help in cases of violence of harassment. Particularly when it comes to late-night routes, passengers may be in near-empty train cars. To provide peace of mind for all passengers, urban-travel planners should install highly visible GPS panic buttons throughout the system, as they have in New Delhi and Bangalore.\nCommuters with specific needs could be directed to the train\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safe wagons with security personnel and closer supervision. Pregnant women or passengers with specific physical needs could wear \u00e2\u0080\u009cMay I sit\u00e2\u0080\u009d pins to alert other commuters to give way to them. Travel providers could also make it easier for these commuters to find information about connections and the safest ways to get to the next boarding point.\nWhile our case study focuses on rail travel, alternative transport modes may offer other opportunities for greater inclusion. The flexibility afforded by bus travel presents more options for making the travel experience safer. Passengers could be allowed to alight, on request, at specific time slots, for example, from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m., to reduce the distance between the drop-off point to the final destination. This is exactly what the city of Madrid put in place, arranging on-demand night bus stops on interurban bus lines.\nCreating an inclusive urban-transport system doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop the moment a passenger gets off the train. Transport providers could review the arrival experiences and partner with security companies to provide additional support or with taxi and rideshare companies to provide special rates for arriving passengers.\nSetting the goal of an entirely accessible public-transport system is becoming increasingly common in major cities worldwide. Barcelona has committed to a 100 percent accessible underground metro system by 2024, and Seattle is already fully wheelchair accessible.\nOther municipalities and travel providers can do the same by undertaking a thorough assessment of customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 needs along the whole journey, mapping the potential pain points, and implementing targeted initiatives to address them. Of course, this process is an iterative one; any initiatives launched should be evaluated and refined over time. The systemic, end-to-end approach outlined in this article should help make traveling in our cities truly safer for all."}, {"title": "Inclusive Transport Strategy", "article": "The Department for Transport\u2019s ( DfT \u2019s) strategy to create an inclusive transport system for disabled travellers.\nOur strategy sets out:\ngovernment\u2019s actions for achieving equal access to transport for disabled people\na clear programme of monitoring and evaluation\na new governance framework for accountability\nThe strategy builds on the work of the 2017 consultation on a draft Accessibility Action Plan.\nThe ministerial letter to local authorities about the strategy is included.\nAudio version\nThe Inclusive Transport Strategy has been supplied in an audio version.\nThe running time is 3 hours 35 minutes and 32 seconds.\nInclusive Transport Strategy audio version\nBritish sign language version\nThe Inclusive Transport Strategy has been supplied in a sign language version.\nInclusive Transport Strategy sign language version.\n\u2018it\u2019s everyone\u2019s journey\u2019 campaign\nAs part of the Inclusive Transport Strategy, DfT has developed the \u2018it\u2019s everyone\u2019s journey\u2019 public campaign to create a more considerate and supportive travelling environment for disabled people, so they can travel easily and with confidence.

Arora isn\u2019t the only one pushing for more thoughtful travel experiences\u2014here\u2019s a look at six companies focused on accessible travel.\nTravel for All\nTravel for All has organized more than 5,000 vacations around the world for travelers with a variety of requirements, including cane users, slow walkers, hearing and vision impaired persons, travelers with complex health issues like dialysis and developmental disabilities, and wheelchair users. \u201cAs multiple sclerosis began to affect my own personal travel, I researched what resources could assist me with executing travel using my wheelchair,\u201d says CEO Tarita Davenock. \u201cI was shocked when I saw the lack of services.\u201d Every trip Travel for All plans comes with an accessibility specialist. \u201cWe research and give our clients the pros and cons of any area in the world before planning the trip, so our client knows what to expect while they are in that destination,\u201d says Davenock. \u201cMeticulous planning and great attention to detail are the keystones of keeping our vacations safe.\u201d\nA Seable group trip in Cambodia, where travelers visited the Wat Phnom temple Courtesy Seable Holidays\nSeable Holidays\nSeable Holidays specializes in trips for visually impaired travelers. All trips include trained chaperones\u2014who undergo a background check\u2014as well as inclusive sports and sensory activities like horse riding, scuba diving, kayaking, wine tasting, yoga, and tactile museum excursions. And everything is thoroughly vetted, with chaperones, activities, and accommodations tested by blind people before they\u2019re recommended by the company. While trips are on pause during the pandemic, Seable Holidays will bring them back in summer 2022.\nEasy Access Travel\nDebra Kerper and her team at Easy Access Travel accommodate most types of physical disabilities in their solo trips and mixed group tours. While Kerper sometimes relies on her own experiences as a traveler in a wheelchair, she says every trip needs to be tailored to an individual client\u2019s needs. To do so, the team spends time getting to know their clients to match them with the best vacation choice, and visits hotels and tourist spots for inspection, takes cruises beforehand, and collects information from trustworthy sources to ensure a safe, accessible, and fun experience.\nPlanet Abled\nNeha Arora\u2019s Planet Abled arranges customized tours for people with different types of disabilities, and also plans group tours that include non-disabled people. Their trips mostly take place in India and South East Asia, with plans to expand to countries in Europe, and popular activities include river rafting, skiing, trekking, and wildlife safaris. Some of their extra touches include assigning a travel buddy for the blind, seeking special permission from museums so clients can touch and feel the articles on display, and arranging for sign language interpreters for the hearing impaired.\nWheel the World\nAlvaro Silberstein, the CEO of Wheel the World, was paralyzed from the chest down after surviving an accident at 18. This didn\u2019t stop him from seeing the world\u2014he\u2019s since visited 30 countries on five continents. \u201cI realized that people with disabilities should be able to explore places as anyone else,\u201d he says. Most of his clients are adults or seniors with mobility disabilities and wheelchair users, and he can arrange solo travel or group trips. Silberstein wants to create more awareness around accessibility, and his company pays special attention to details like the height of beds, width of doors, and accessibility of bathrooms, compiling this information on the Wheel the World website. Their multi-day trips are designed with local tour operators with a focus on accessible travel, and includes access to adaptive bikes, beach wheelchairs, and equipment for hiking, skydiving, kayaking, scuba diving, and surfing\u2014they\u2019ve even planned Macchu Pichu trips for wheelchair users. The company makes sure \u201cprices are competitive and the pricing is the same no matter if the clients have a disability or not,\u201d says Silberstein.\nA quiet moment in Sintra, Portugal Courtesy Tapooz Travel/Aicha Nystrom\nTapooz Travel\nLaurent Roffe and Aicha Nystrom spent years volunteering with an organization that provides outdoors excursions to people with disabilities. \u201cWe have many friends in wheelchairs as part of our close community,\u201d says Roffe. \u201cI\u2019m a sea kayak guide and [Aicha] is a ski guide and this has always been a source of immense joy for us. Launching our accessible travel business was a natural extension of what we are and what we like to do.\u201d Their company, Tapooz Travel, specializes in trips for those with mobility issues, including visual and hearing impairment, rather than cognitive disabilities. When they have a client with a visual or hearing impairment, they make sure there\u2019s at least one guide trained in sign language, or have a guide who can help with things like reading the menu at the restaurant and providing a voice narration during a site visit. Their network also includes adaptive sports instructors, sailboat skippers, tribal elders, massage therapists, and hot air balloon operators, all of whom are trained to work with travelers with disabilities."}, {"title": "Accessible Coach Holidays", "article": "Award-winning accessible coach holidays.

Professional and specialised skills may be considered normal day-to-day activities.[ 2 ]\nImpairment\nAny medically recognised condition could amount to a physical or mental impairment. Mental illness does not need to be clinically recognised.[ 3 ]\nSome conditions such as cancer, HIV infection and multiple sclerosis automatically amount to a disability.[ 4 ] Certain categories of blind person are deemed to be disabled.[ 5 ] A severe disfigurement (apart from tattoos and non-medical piercings) is to be treated as impairment with substantial and long-term adverse effect on a person's ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities.[ 6 ]\nRegulations may specify conditions which do not amount to impairment (and so to a disability).[ 7 ] Current regulations exclude addiction to alcohol, nicotine or any other substance unless addiction was originally the result of administration of medically prescribed drugs or other medical treatment.[ 8 ] Tendencies to set fires, steal, physically or sexually abuse other persons, or engage in exhibitionism or voyeurism, are also excluded.\nLong-term effect of impairment\nUnder the Equality Act 2010, an impairment has a long term effect if it either:[ 9 ]\nhas lasted for at least 12 months\nis likely to last for at least 12 months\nis likely to last for the rest of the life of the person affected. As such, a terminal illness will meet this criteria regardless of its duration\nSubstantial effect\nSubstantial effect is now defined as one that is greater than the effect which would be produced by the sort of physical or mental conditions experienced by many people who have only minor or trivial effects.[ 10 ] Determining whether an impairment has a substantial adverse effect requires a comparison between how a person would carry out an activity with and without it.[ 11 ]\nChildren under the age of six with an impairment that does not have a substantial and long-term adverse effect on their ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities are to be treated as disabled if the impairment would normally have a substantial and long-term adverse effect on the ability of a person aged six years or over to carry out normal day-to-day activities.[ 12 ]\nThe positive effects of any medical treatment and/or the use of prosthesis or other aid are to be disregarded when determining whether impairment has a long term adverse effect.[ 13 ]\nIntermittent and recurring conditions\nIf an impairment ceases to have a substantial and long-term adverse effect on a person's ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities, it is to be treated as continuing to have that effect if the substantial and long-term adverse effect is likely to recur.[ 14 ] A substantial effect is likely to recur if it 'could well happen'.[ 15 ]\nThe correct test applicable to questions of whether a substantial adverse effect of a condition is recurring has been formulated by the courts.[ 16 ]\nProgressive conditions\nIf a person's ability to carry out day-to-day activities is affected by a progressive condition, that condition is to be treated as an impairment having a substantial and long-term adverse effect on that person's ability to carry out day-to-day activities if the condition is likely to result in the person developing such impairment.\nRegulations may provide for a condition of a prescribed description to be treated as being, or as not being, progressive.[ 17 ]"}, {"title": "Housing options for older people", "article": "The time may come when living at home isn't safe or comfortable anymore.

People are living longer lives and the proportion of older people in the population is increasing. In mid-2016 there were 1.6 million people aged 85 and over; by mid-2041 this is projected to double to 3.2 million. Offering older people a better choice of accommodation to suit their changing needs can help them live independently for longer, feel more connected to their communities and help reduce costs to the social care and health systems. Therefore, an understanding of how the ageing population affects housing needs is something to be considered from the early stages of plan-making through to decision-taking.\nParagraph: 001 Reference ID: 63-001-20190626\nRevision date: 26 June 2019\nWhy is it important to plan for the housing needs of disabled people?\nThe provision of appropriate housing for people with disabilities, including specialist and supported housing, is crucial in helping them to live safe and independent lives. Unsuitable or unadapted housing can have a negative impact on disabled people and their carers. It can lead to mobility problems inside and outside the home, poorer mental health and a lack of employment opportunities. Providing suitable housing can enable disabled people to live more independently and safely, with greater choice and control over their lives. Without accessible and adaptable housing, disabled people risk facing discrimination and disadvantage in housing. An ageing population will see the numbers of disabled people continuing to increase and it is important we plan early to meet their needs throughout their lifetime.\nParagraph: 002 Reference ID: 63-002-20190626\nRevision date: 26 June 2019\nWhat range of needs should be addressed?\nThe National Planning Policy Framework glossary provides definitions of older people and people with disabilities for planning purposes, which recognise the diverse range of needs that exist. The health and lifestyles of older people will differ greatly, as will their housing needs, which can range from accessible and adaptable general needs housing to specialist housing with high levels of care and support. For plan-making purposes, strategic policy-making authorities will need to determine the needs of people who will be approaching or reaching retirement over the plan period, as well as the existing population of older people.\nSimilarly, disabilities can include, but are not limited to, people with ambulatory difficulties, blindness, learning difficulties, autism and mental health needs, which may generate a range of housing requirements which can change over time. Local planning authorities may also wish to consider groups outside of the scope of this definition in order to meet specific needs within their community. To enable disabled people to live more safely and independently, local planning authorities will need to consider their variety of needs in both plan-making and decision-taking.\nParagraph: 003 Reference ID: 63-003-20190626\nRevision date: 26 June 2019\nIdentifying the housing requirements of older and disabled people\nWhat evidence can plan-makers consider when identifying the housing needs of older people?\nThe age profile of the population can be drawn from Census data. Projections of population and households by age group can also be used. The future need for specialist accommodation for older people broken down by tenure and type (e.g. sheltered housing, extra care) may need to be assessed and can be obtained from a number of online tool kits provided by the sector, for example the Strategic Housing for Older People Analysis Tool (SHOP@), which is a tool for forecasting the housing and care needs of older people. Evidence from Joint Strategic Needs Assessments prepared by Health and Wellbeing Boards can also be useful. The assessment of need can also set out the level of need for residential care homes.\nParagraph: 004 Reference ID: 63-004-20190626\nRevision date: 26 June 2019\nWhat evidence can plan-makers consider when identifying the housing needs of people with disabilities?\nMultiple sources of information may need to be considered in relation to disabled people who require adaptations in the home, either now or in the future. The Census provides information on the number of people with a long-term limiting illness and plan-makers can access information from the Department for Work and Pensions on the numbers of Personal Independence Payment (replacing Disability Living Allowance) / Attendance Allowance benefit claimants. Whilst these data sources can provide an indication of the number of disabled people, not all of the people included within these counts will require adaptations in the home. Applications for Disabled Facilities Grant (DFG) will provide an indication of levels of expressed need, although this will underestimate total need, as there may be a large number of people who would want or need an adaptation, but would not have applied to the DFG.\nEngagement at all levels can help plan-makers identify the housing needs of people with disabilities. This could include with occupational therapists and specialist access or inclusive design officers. Discussions with disabled people and disabled people\u2019s groups can also provide insights into the types of impairments and number of people likely to require accessible homes in the future.\nParagraph: 005 Reference ID: 63-005-20190626\nRevision date: 26 June 2019\nHow can the housing requirements of particular groups of people be addressed in plans?\nPlan-making authorities should set clear policies to address the housing needs of groups with particular needs such as older and disabled people. These policies can set out how the plan-making authority will consider proposals for the different types of housing that these groups are likely to require. They could also provide indicative figures or a range for the number of units of specialist housing for older people needed across the plan area throughout the plan period.\nParagraph: 006 Reference ID: 63-006-20190626\nRevision date: 26 June 2019\nHow can local planning authorities monitor the number of homes for older and disabled people?\nGuidance on plan-making sets out the role of local planning authorities in monitoring progress with plan preparation and information collected which relates to indicators in the plan. Local planning authorities can include the provision of housing for older and disabled people when preparing the Authority Monitoring Report.\nParagraph: 007 Reference ID: 63-007-20190626\nRevision date: 26 June 2019\nAccessible and adaptable housing\nWhat are the benefits of accessible and adaptable housing?\nAccessible and adaptable housing enables people to live more independently, while also saving on health and social costs in the future. It is better to build accessible housing from the outset rather than have to make adaptations at a later stage \u2013 both in terms of cost and with regard to people being able to remain safe and independent in their homes.\nAccessible and adaptable housing will provide safe and convenient approach routes into and out of the home and outside areas, suitable circulation space and suitable bathroom and kitchens within the home. Wheelchair user dwellings include additional features to meet the needs of occupants who use wheelchairs, or allow for adaptations to meet such needs.\nParagraph: 008 Reference ID: 63-008-20190626\nRevision date: 26 June 2019\nShould plan-making bodies set minimum requirements for accessible housing?\nWhere an identified need exists, plans are expected to make use of the optional technical housing standards (footnote 46 of the National Planning Policy Framework) to help bring forward an adequate supply of accessible housing. In doing so planning policies for housing can set out the proportion of new housing that will be delivered to the following standards:\nM4(1) Category 1: Visitable dwellings (the minimum standard that applies where no planning condition is given unless a plan sets a higher minimum requirement)\nM4(2) Category 2: Accessible and adaptable dwellings\nM4(3) Category 3: Wheelchair user dwellings\nPlanning policies for accessible housing need to be based on evidence of need, viability and a consideration of site specific factors.\nParagraph: 009 Reference ID: 63-009-20190626\nRevision date: 26 June 2019\nSpecialist housing for older people\nWhat are the different types of specialist housing for older people?\nThere are different types of specialist housing designed to meet the diverse needs of older people, which can include:\nAge-restricted general market housing: This type of housing is generally for people aged 55 and over and the active elderly. It may include some shared amenities such as communal gardens, but does not include support or care services.\nRetirement living or sheltered housing: This usually consists of purpose-built flats or bungalows with limited communal facilities such as a lounge, laundry room and guest room. It does not generally provide care services, but provides some support to enable residents to live independently. This can include 24 hour on-site assistance (alarm) and a warden or house manager.\nExtra care housing or housing-with-care: This usually consists of purpose-built or adapted flats or bungalows with a medium to high level of care available if required, through an onsite care agency registered through the Care Quality Commission (CQC). Residents are able to live independently with 24 hour access to support services and staff, and meals are also available. There are often extensive communal areas, such as space to socialise or a wellbeing centre. In some cases, these developments are known as retirement communities or villages - the intention is for residents to benefit from varying levels of care as time progresses.\nResidential care homes and nursing homes: These have individual rooms within a residential building and provide a high level of care meeting all activities of daily living. They do not usually include support services for independent living. This type of housing can also include dementia care homes.\nThere is a significant amount of variability in the types of specialist housing for older people. The list above provides an indication of the different types of housing available, but is not definitive. Any single development may contain a range of different types of specialist housing.\nParagraph: 010 Reference ID: 63-010-20190626\nRevision date: 26 June 2019\nHow can plan-making authorities plan for senior co-housing communities?\nSenior co-housing communities are created and run by residents, based on the intention to live with a group of people of a similar age. The sites often consist of self-contained private homes as well as shared community space. Some communities offer an additional option for informal care. Local planning authorities can plan for senior co-housing communities through their implementation of the Self-build and custom-build legislation 2015, as some communities will be looking to build the development themselves. Plan-making authorities can also identify sites suitable for senior co-housing communities as part of their overall assessment of land available for housing over the plan period.\nParagraph: 011 Reference ID: 63-011-20190626\nRevision date: 26 June 2019\nDo plans need to make specific provision for specialist housing for older people?\nPlans need to provide for specialist housing for older people where a need exists. Innovative and diverse housing models will need to be considered where appropriate.\nMany older people may not want or need specialist accommodation or care and may wish to stay or move to general housing that is already suitable, such as bungalows, or homes which can be adapted to meet a change in their needs. Plan-makers will therefore need to identify the role that general housing may play as part of their assessment.\nPlan-makers will need to consider the size, location and quality of dwellings needed in the future for older people in order to allow them to live independently and safely in their own home for as long as possible, or to move to more suitable accommodation if they so wish.\nParagraph: 012 Reference ID: 63-012-20190626\nRevision date: 26 June 2019\nDo plans need to allocate sites for specialist housing for older people?\nIt is up to the plan-making body to decide whether to allocate sites for specialist housing for older people. Allocating sites can provide greater certainty for developers and encourage the provision of sites in suitable locations. This may be appropriate where there is an identified unmet need for specialist housing. The location of housing is a key consideration for older people who may be considering whether to move (including moving to more suitable forms of accommodation). Factors to consider include the proximity of sites to good public transport, local amenities, health services and town centres.\nParagraph: 013 Reference ID: 63-013-20190626\nRevision date: 26 June 2019\nHow does the use classes order apply to specialist housing for older people?\nIt is for a local planning authority to consider into which use class a particular development may fall. When determining whether a development for specialist housing for older people falls within C2 (Residential Institutions) or C3 (Dwellinghouse) of the Use Classes Order, consideration could, for example, be given to the level of care and scale of communal facilities provided.\nParagraph: 014 Reference ID: 63-014-20190626\nRevision date: 26 June 2019\nHow can the viability of proposals for specialist housing for older people be assessed?\nViability guidance sets out how plan makers and decision takers should take account of viability, including for specialist housing for older people. Plans should set out the contributions expected from development. This should include setting out the levels and types of affordable housing provision required, along with other infrastructure. Plans can set out different policy requirements for different types of development. These policy requirements should be informed by evidence of infrastructure and affordable housing need, and a proportionate assessment of viability that takes into account all relevant policies and local and national standards, including the cost implications of Community Infrastructure Levy and section 106.\nViability guidance states that where up to date policies have set out the contributions expected from development, planning applications that comply with them should be assumed to be viable. It is up to the applicant to demonstrate whether particular circumstances justify the need for a viability assessment at the application stage. Such circumstances could include types of development which may significantly vary from standard models of development for sale (for example housing for older people).\nParagraph: 015 Reference ID: 63-015-20190626\nRevision date: 26 June 2019\nWhat factors should decision makers consider when assessing planning applications for specialist housing for older people?\nDecision makers should consider the location and viability of a development when assessing planning applications for specialist housing for older people. Local planning authorities can encourage the development of more affordable models and make use of products like shared ownership. Where there is an identified unmet need for specialist housing, local authorities should take a positive approach to schemes that propose to address this need.\nParagraph: 016 Reference ID: 63-016-20190626\nRevision date: 26 June 2019\nHow should plan-making authorities count specialist housing for older people against their housing requirement?\nPlan-making authorities will need to count housing provided for older people against their housing requirement. For residential institutions, to establish the amount of accommodation released in the housing market, authorities should base calculations on the average number of adults living in households, using the published Census data.\nParagraph: 016a Reference ID: 63-016a-20190626\nRevision date: 26 June 2019\nInclusive design\nHow can planning and design promote access and inclusion?\nAn inclusive environment is one that can be accessed and used by everyone. It recognises and accommodates differences in the way people use the built environment and fosters social connections.\nGood design can help to create buildings and places that are for everyone. It can help break down unnecessary physical and psychological barriers and exclusions caused by the poor design of buildings and places.\nInclusive design acknowledges diversity and difference and is more likely to be achieved when it is considered at every stage of the development process, from inception to completion. However, it is often mistakenly seen as a Building Regulations issue, to be addressed once planning permission has been granted, not at the planning application stage. The most effective way to overcome conflicting policies and to maximise accessibility for everyone is for all parties to consider inclusive design from the outset of the process. This is particularly important when considering historic buildings and conservation, and highways. Thinking at the design stage about how the completed building will be occupied and managed can overcome many barriers experienced by some users. Too often the needs of users, including disabled people, older people and families with small children, are considered too late in the day.\nParagraph: 017 Reference ID: 63-017-20190626\nRevision date: 26 June 2019\nHow can places be designed to be age-friendly and accessible for all?\nThe inclusive and age-friendly design of public spaces such as town centres, and of individual buildings, including housing, has clear benefits (Building for Equality: Disability and the Built Environment report). Inclusive design can help older and disabled people live more independently and reduce health and social care costs.\nInclusive design should not only be specific to the building, but also include the setting of the building in the wider built environment, for example, the location of the building on the plot; the gradient of the plot; the relationship of adjoining buildings; and the transport infrastructure. As set out in the revised National Planning Policy Framework, developments should address the needs of people with disabilities and reduced mobility in relation to all modes of transport.\nIssues to consider include:\nease and comfort of movement on foot and with mobility aids between homes, services and town centres;\nproximity and links to public transport and local amenities;\nparking spaces and setting down points in proximity to entrances;\nthe positioning and visual contrast of street furniture and the design of approach routes to meet the needs of people with different needs, including wheelchair users, people who need to rest while they walk and people with visual impairments;\nwhether entrances to buildings are clearly identified, can be reached by a level or gently sloping approach and are well lit;\nthe accessibility of public spaces including step free spaces and seating; and\nthe availability of public toilets.\nDesign principles such as those set out in the Housing our Ageing Population Panel for Innovation (HAPPI) report are applicable to housing for older people and age-friendly places including:\nintegration with the surrounding context\nsocial spaces that link with the community\nspace standards that facilitate flexibility\nenhanced natural light\npriority for pedestrians in outdoor spaces\nParagraph: 018 Reference ID: 63-018-20190626\nRevision date: 26 June 2019\nHow can for the needs of people with dementia be addressed?\nEvidence has shown that good quality housing and sensitively planned environments can have a substantial impact on the quality of life of someone living with dementia. People with dementia need to have access to care and support to enable them to live independently and homes need to be designed with their needs in mind.\nLocal planning authorities should consider design principles when developing new housing in the context of the wider built environment, especially housing aimed at people with dementia. Characteristics of a dementia-friendly community include, but are not limited to:\neasy to navigate physical environment\nappropriate transport\ncommunities shaped around the views of people with dementia and their carers\ngood orientation and familiarity\nreduction in unnecessary clutter\nreduction in disorienting visual and auditory stimuli\nThere should be a range of housing options and tenures available to people with dementia, including mainstream and specialist housing. Innovative and diverse housing models should be considered where appropriate.\nParagraph: 019 Reference ID: 63-019-20190626\nRevision date: 26 June 2019"}, {"title": "Accessible Hotel", "article": "The UK has everything you need for a wonderful family holiday, short break or romantic getaway - and with DisabledHolidays.com you can enjoy all it has to offer knowing your accessibilty needs will be met!

Go to your local authority website or contact your local housing service to find out how to apply for social housing in your area. The process can vary in different areas. But you usually apply online to your local authority or council housing service. Find your local authority (GOV.UK) Apply for council housing (GOV.UK) If you cannot apply online, contact the council for an application form. Shelter has a postcode search to help you find your local housing office. How to apply for council housing (Shelter) Councils and housing associations must make the application process accessible to you. Ask for reasonable adjustments like Word documents or Easy Read. Asking for reasonable adjustments\nGet help applying If you find the application process complicated or difficult, a charity, occupational therapist (OT) or social care worker can help you apply. They can also refer you to your local housing department. Charities may also be able to give you housing advice or refer you to a housing adviser. Shelter housing advisers\nCheck the local allocations scheme or policy Local councils and housing associations will have different applications and rules. For example, some might ask for references from a previous landlord. Read your local council or housing association allocations policy or scheme. It should tell you: how the process works in your area\nhow they decide priority Councils and housing associations usually organise priority using a points or group system, sometimes called \u2018bands\u2019. Each council or housing association will have their own band system. Priority will be based on your needs, such as if you\u2019re: legally homeless\nmoving because of disability or a serious, long-term health condition\nmoving to a different area because of hardship, such as getting medical treatment or because you\u2019re in danger Knowing how they allocate priority bands can help you include the right information in your application. Speak to a housing adviser or occupational therapist (OT) if you need support. If you disagree with your priority band, you can challenge it. Challenging the council\u2019s decision about your housing application (Citizens Advice)\nFilling in the application form Local authorities or councils usually have an application form you can download or fill in online. Filling in the form with someone who knows you well can help. This could be a family member, friend, OT or social care worker who understands your needs. Each local area will have its own process but the information you need to include will be similar. For example: who lives with you\nhow many rooms you need\nadaptations you need\nif you need an adapted home, like a wheelchair accessible flat\nyour income, including benefits\nyour savings and any assets, like a car If you need adaptations or an adapted property, some councils and housing associations might ask for a OT needs assessment as part of your application. You can ask your local authority for this. Home adaptations and occupational therapist assessments You might need to give medical information or evidence. This could be letters or reports from healthcare professionals, like your GP, OT, hospital doctors or specialists. Some local areas might have a \u2018medical assessment\u2019 form to fill. Check your local allocations policy to find out what medical information or assessments you need.\nWaiting lists If the local authority approves your application, you will join a waiting list. Local authority waiting lists can include: council housing\nhousing association homes\nhousing associations only providing accessible housing If you think you do not have the right priority, ask the council to review it. Make sure you check the priority criteria in the allocations scheme before asking for a review. Council housing (GOV.UK) Getting a council home (Citizens Advice) How long does it take to get a council home? (Shelter) Housing association waiting lists Some local housing associations will let you apply directly. But it can help to speak to your local council housing office first. They can tell you about the process for your area and if there are housing associations with their own lists. It can help to register for these independent lists as well as the council list. Housing association homes (GOV.UK) Housing associations for adapted properties Some housing associations offer adapted properties only, for example Habinteg. If there is a waiting list for your area, you can usually apply on the housing association website. They can also list their adapted homes with the council and may recommend you join the council list too.\nWaiting for a property Your priority on the waiting list is based on your needs. How long you\u2019ll wait for a home will depend on: how many properties are available\nhow high your priority is\nhow many people are before you on the waiting list\nif you need an adapted property and how many are available You can ask the housing association or council how long they think you\u2019ll have to wait. This estimate is not based on your personal situation but can help you make a decision about your current housing.\nWarning Waiting lists can be long You may have to wait a long time, possibly years, for a suitable property to become available, even if you are high priority.\nDirect offers and bidding for properties Check the allocations scheme to find out how your council assigns properties. This will vary between councils and could be one of the following systems: you have to \u2018bid\u2019 for homes (choice-based lettings)\nyou\u2019re offered a suitable home when it becomes available (direct offers)\nthe council uses both choice-based lettings and direct offers Choice-based lettings (CBL) You look for properties you\u2019re eligible for and apply. This is usually called \u2018bidding\u2019. People with the highest priority will get an offer first. With choice-based lettings, you need to find and bid on properties. If your council only uses choice-based lettings, you will not get offers without bidding, even if you are high priority. You can bid online, by phone or by text. If the system is not accessible to you, the local council must give you another way to bid. For example, a proxy bid system where the housing association or council bids for you. Ask your council or housing association for more information. Direct offers The council or housing association will offer you a suitable property when it becomes available. They might do this by phone and then follow it up with a letter. If your council uses both direct offers and choice-based lettings, you might also need to bid for properties you\u2019re eligible for.\nGetting offered a property Check your local council or housing association policy on offers. Some will only offer 1 suitable property. If you only get 1 offer, accept the property even if you feel it is not completely suitable. Once you\u2019ve accepted, you can ask for adaptations or a council review of the suitability. Challenge a council housing register decision (Shelter) Some councils or housing associations may give you a chance to explain why you feel a property is not suitable. Do this in writing and include evidence from professionals supporting you, like an OT or a social care worker. Help with discrimination in housing (Equality and Human Rights Commission) You could also check if you can get legal aid or free legal advice about your rights and what you can do next. Finding legal help (Citizens Advice)\nAsking for adaptations If you need minor adaptations, first accept the property and ask for them. Local councils and housing associations will usually pay for small adaptations that cost under \u00a31,000. You can try working with them to make the adaptations before you move in. Or you can wait until after you have signed the tenancy agreement. Once you are a tenant, your social landlord must make reasonable adjustments. You can ask for an OT needs assessment if you do not already have one. What is considered reasonable will depend on cost and the type of adaptation. Social housing landlords should have a budget for reasonable adjustments and minor adaptations. Getting home adaptations Major adaptations If you need major adaptations, your council and housing association do not have to make these by law. They may want you to move into an adapted property instead. You can still apply for major adaptations. Approval will depend on: the type of property, for example, if it\u2019s a listed building\nadaptation cost\ntype of adaptation\nthe council or housing association\u2019s policy You can apply for a Disabled Facilities Grant (DFG) to help with the cost of large adaptations. DFG is means-tested (based on income) so check if you\u2019re eligible.

If I can\u2019t use a product or service, then the business loses not only one person\u2019s business, but five.\u201d\nAs seen in the above quote, Martin Heng emphasizes that people with disabilities and people with different access needs do travel, and are likely to travel with others. And these travelers represent, according to the Amadeus Accessibility Study, a \"$70 billion market\" just in Europe and the USA.\nThis fact alone would make a strong business case for investing time, effort, and resources needed to become more accessible and inclusive as a business and as an industry. But beyond the economic imperative, there are important reasons for the tourism industry to take this segment seriously.\nBelow are some ideas and insights on how and why we should promote not just accessibility, but also inclusive tourism that benefits everyone as well as relevant industry resources for tourism businesses and destinations seeking to better understand accessible and inclusive tourism, and to improve their practices. Parts of the content featured here have been inspired by and based on Martin's presentation (originally recorded on July 18th, 2019 as part of the GSTC Sustainable Tourism Training Online Course).\nTourism for All: Including As Many Different Groups As Possible\nContrary to what many might think, accessible tourism is not just about providing facilities that are wheel-chair accessible.\nSenior travelers. Parents traveling with small kids. Travelers with allergies and other medical conditions. These are all different types of travelers who have different degrees of accessibility restrictions and mobility requirements.\nAnd a large proportion of travelers with disabilities have \"invisible\" impairments (such as cognitive or mental health conditions and long-term illnesses) that may not be, unlike wheelchair users, immediately obvious just by looking at them.\nWhen planning for and communicating about the accessibility features and services you provide, therefore, rather than simply using the \"handicap symbol\" (the ubiquitously used sign of a wheelchair user - the top-left pictogram on the above image), these various areas of accessibility needs must be considered and appropriately indicated.\nShare on your website and brochures, for example, if you provide assistive listening devices on your tour, or if sign language interpretation is available within any of the attractions you visit.\n\"Tourism for All\" is a concept that is addressing a growing segment of travelers with a diverse range of needs and requirements. What is \"accessible\" to one traveler who is a wheelchair user, for example, may be very difficult to access or completely inaccessible to another traveler with a different type of disability, mobility impairment or other conditions.\nThat's why becoming more inclusive is a more appropriate goal for the tourism industry than focusing just on \"accessible tourism\" (which can be vague and hard to define - accessible for whom?).\nAn inclusive tourism business or destination works to offer positive travel experiences to people with different needs by addressing them from various perspectives, and by providing design and service solutions that aim to cover as many different groups as possible.\nUniversal Design: Designing for Everyone, Being a Good Host\nWhen it comes to being inclusive and promoting Tourism for All, a key concept that underlies the solutions to be implement by tourism businesses and destinations is Universal Design.\nThe definition of Universal Design is as follows:\nUniversal Design is the design and composition of an environment so that it can be accessed, understood and used to the greatest extent possible by all people regardless of their age, size, ability or disability. An environment (or any building, product, or service in that environment) should be designed to meet the needs of all people who wish to use it. This is not a special requirement, for the benefit of only a minority of the population. It is a fundamental condition of good design. If an environment is accessible, usable, convenient and a pleasure to use, everyone benefits.\n- Centre for Excellence in Universal Design, \" What is Universal Design\nTo understand where you need to improve in order to offer universally accessible experience for everyone's benefit, take some time to reflect on the whole customer journey from the perspectives of guests with different access needs and mobility requirements.\nThink about how they experience travel - from the customer finding your business, to booking their trip, to arriving in your destination, to getting around during their stay.\nAre there steps to enter the restaurant that will make it difficult for customers with limited mobility? Does your hotel offer an accessible and easy-to-follow process for guests with disabilities to check in/out and get around within the property? And is your website designed for users with different needs (e.g. individuals with hearing or vision impairment)?\nBusinesses often have barriers that make it difficult for customers with particular access or mobility impairments to enjoy a certain product or service, because of the lack of awareness that those barriers exist.\nAnd in some cases, businesses may be \"rejecting\" prospective customers without ever knowing. The 2016 Click-Away Pound study found that \"71% of customers with access needs will click away from a website that they find difficult to use\".\nWith all the different types of accessibility requirements, it may seem difficult or impossible to anticipate and accommodate the various needs of your customers. But it's important to remember that in tourism we are in the business of providing services to welcome guests; and that it is in fact your responsibility as a host to cater to the needs of your guests and to make them feel welcome.\nIt's part of being a good host.\nBy considering the diverse needs and abilities of all throughout the design process, universal design creates products, services and environments that meet peoples' needs. Simply put, universal design is good design. - Centre for Excellence in Universal Design, \"What is Universal Design\"\nInclusive Growth and Sustainable Development\nWith the growing importance of the accessible tourism market, and especially the spending power of this market segment including the \"multiplier effect\" (each traveler with impairment is likely to influence the purchase decisions of multiple members of their party), there is a strong economic imperative to be considered. To remain competitive, your tourism business and destination should be investing in universal design and inclusive solutions.\nBeyond the economic imperative, however, there are also key reasons why inclustive tourism should be part of the global sustainable tourism agenda.\nWith an estimated 15% of the world population living with some forms of disabilities (World Health Organization, World Report on Disability 2011), and the changing demographic of the \"rapidly ageing\" populations around the world (WHO, Aging and Life Course), sustainable development can only be achieved through an inclusive approach to creating solutions and opportunities.\nThe United Nations' \"Disability and Development Report: Realizing the Sustainable Development Goals by, for and with persons with disabilities\" (2018) recognizes that \"striving to achieve disability-inclusive development is not only the right thing to do, it is also the practical thing to do,\" as \"the success of the 2030 Agenda requires a participatory and inclusive approach in which all stakeholders, including persons with disabilities, are engaged.\"\nAnd that's why Tourism for All is highlighted in the Global Sustainable Tourism Criteria, the baseline standard for sustainability in travel and tourism.\nSource: Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC)\nAnd in the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO)'s Global Code of Ethics for Tourism.\nSource: UNWTO, Global Code of Ethics for Tourism\nInclusion in the Work Place\nHaving understood the importance of striving for universal design and working towards becoming more inclusive, what can tourism businesses do to get started? What are some of the first steps?\nOne of the key challenges when considering steps to becoming more inclusive is to understand the diverse needs of your customers and your prospective customers. The barriers that prevent some people from having a positive travel experience - whether they may be steps that cannot be climbed, signs that cannot be read, or buttons that cannot be reached - are hard to notice unless you put yourself in the position of those with particular disabilities and impairments.\nOne of the most effective ways for businesses to understand the various accessibility needs of their customers is to have team members who know and represent the perspectives of those customers. In short, hire people with disabilities. Empower them to help make your business more inclusive, both within your operations and through your products and services.\nThe UNWTO report \"Recommendations on Accessible Tourism\" (2013) states that \"the staff of tourism establishments and related services should be prepared to know, understand and address the needs of customers with disabilities\", and \"the staff should include employees who know how to communicate with persons with sensory disabilities.\"\n\"The hospitality industry serves travellers from all over the world. The diversity of cultures implies a diversity of customer expectations as well. The hotels with a diverse workforce to cater to such a wide customer base hold a strong competitive advantage over others. ... [To] have employees that understand the needs and requirements of the customers and provide key insights into making properties progressively accessible is also a crucial element of the overall business strategy.\" - Hospitality Workers Training Centre, \"Disability Inclusion in the Hospitality Industry Makes Business Sense\"\nBusiness Examples: Staff Diversity and Inclusion\nLemon Tree Hotels Limited, India\nWinner of the 2019 Tourism for Tomorrow Awards, in the category \"Investing in People\", Lemon Tree Hotels have focused on creating a socially inclusive work environment, bringing together people of different backgrounds, abilities and ethnicities to work as a unified team with a common goal. Lemon Tree supports \"opportunity deprived\" workers, including those with physical, social or economic disabilities, by creating and offering opportunities to realize their full potential and live with dignity.\nIlunion Hotels, Spain\nFifty percent of ILUNION Hotels' employees have disabilities. The hotel is committed to integrating its approach to universal accessibility not just in its services for customers with disabilities, but also throughout its business model, including its employees and suppliers. Illunion Hotels received the 2016 UNWTO Ethics Award for its work in the area of accessible tourism for all and its contribution to change attitudes, break down social barriers and make the accommodation industry more inclusive.\nEinsmehr Hotel\nPhoto: hoteleinsmehr\nLocated in Augsburg, Germany, Einsmehr Hotel is an inclusive hotel with about half of its workforce consisting of people with disabilities. The hotel works with a local association \"einsmehr\" (\"one more\"), which supports people with the Down Syndrome in the surrounding area, seeking to create jobs and a labor market for people with (mental) disabilities.\nSV Tenacious\nSource: Martin Heng\nOperated by the UK-based Jubilee Sailing Trust (JST), SV Tenacious is the largest wooden tall ship, and the only one of its kind designed and built to be fully accessible for people with disabilities or impairments (including wheelchair users).\nMartin Heng, who joined Tenacious\u2019 voyage from Sydney to Melbourne in 2018, describes his experience in this Lonely Planet blog:\n\"There are no passengers on JST voyages, only crew \u2013 made up of nine permanent crew members and 30 to 40 voyage crew \u2013 and everyone is expected to fulfil their duties to the best of their ability, whatever that ability is. Experiencing a voyage on Tenacious (or her sister ship Lord Nelson) is an object lesson in the benefits of inclusion and accessibility.

In taking a limited Delphi approach to canvassing key areas likely to shape accessible tourism futures, the following concepts and policy initiatives were examined: motivations, dreams and aspirations of people with disability; demography; UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; destination competitiveness; universal design (UD); and the UN Sustainable Development Goals for 2030.\nAccessible tourism is evolving as a field of academic research and industry practice, set within a dynamic social context.

The special issue explores theoretical approaches, foundations and issues in the study of accessible tourism from a futures perspective. Accessible tourism, as with any area of academic study is an evolving field of academic research and industry practice, set within a dynamic social context. The field is interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary, and is influenced by geography, ageing and disability studies, economics, public policy, psychology, law, architecture, construction sciences, technology and marketing. Past research has attempted to view, explain and unpack the inherent complexities (Darcy, 2010) within accessible tourism through a variety of lenses, including human rights, critical tourism, embodiment, customer segmentation and universal design (UD), to name a few (see Buhalis and Darcy, 2011; Buhalis et al., 2012). The special issue is timely given the operationalisation of the United Nations (2006) Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities by 160 countries. Central to the convention is the right for tourists with disability to access transport and built environment in Article 9 and tourism experiences, goods and services within Article 30. It is therefore pertinent to look at the future of accessible tourism and contemplate a number of issues including (but not limited to) the role of technology in reshaping disability; if and how policy makers and planners are addressing the impact of accessible tourism in a sustainable manner; the political influence of people with disabilities, who make up the largest minority group in the USA, on the future of tourism; the science fiction of exoskeletons and gene therapy as a new form of adventure tourist; and the future state of embodied identity and accessible tourism. The special issue provides the opportunity for contributors to take part in the current discourses on accessible tourism from a futures perspective, in order that we can understand, manage and contribute to the development of accessible tourism in the context of economically, socially and environmentally sustainable communities. Specific topics included conceptual and research papers, viewpoints and trend papers, both qualitative and quantitative, discussing topics relating to the future of accessible tourism. Papers include a range of issues including: inclusive destinations; accessible tourism in Development Planning (toward the UN Sustainable Development Goals 2030); policy-making for accessible tourism; embodiment; representation; law and legislation; architecture and universal design; inclusion/exclusion from experiences; markets and needs analysis; accessible transport; accessible events; accessibility and culture/heritage; accessible accommodation; education/training; and technology and applications. In contrast to the past 30 years, where disability and tourism research has been largely concerned with overcoming barriers that exclude certain people (see Smith, 1987), we can discern the contours of new movements in accessible tourism, whereby overarching principles and standards of sustainability, social responsibility and customer service. The delivery of equitable tourism experiences demand the attention of sector actors and stakeholders. Accessible tourism, in this context, should be seen in the future as much more than a range of supports to excluded target groups, becoming a set of ground rules and codes of practice which contribute to the development of all tourism offers and destinations in an inclusive way. If we should gaze into the crystal ball for a moment, we could envisage that tourism will not be defined primarily in terms of different target groups, since principles of responsibility, sustainability and accessibility will in the future inform the quality criteria to which all destinations should comply and be judged as part of destination competitiveness in increasingly global context. Customers will become more aware of their individual rights and also the need to protect and sustain communities and the natural environment, influencing tourism service providers to follow generally accepted rules of service quality, genuine interactivity and engagement with the local culture, people and resources. The capability of tourism providers to recognise those rights for all (e.g. of tourists with disabilities, Design for All, responsible behaviour, inclusion of the local communities in a transparent system of remuneration and participation, working opportunities for socially excluded group etc.) is going to be the threshold, which determines whether their offers will succeed or fail in the future. The tourism sector will increasingly be seen as having transformational power as \u201ca shaper of society\u201d, acting as a promoter of jobs and economic growth, a participant in regional and community planning and a partner in global development programmes. In addition, tourism should be developed as industry that promotes understanding, inclusion and well-being for all in an equitable way. Businesses, destinations and networks, that are already active in the field of accessible tourism and/or representing markets with different specific requirements will participate more widely in the mainstream, bringing their expertise and knowledge to bear on all those issues that are still seen as \u201cdifferent types of tourism\u201d. In the development of accessible destinations and experiences, the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (2015) will be playing an increasingly supportive role, especially through its Global Code for Ethics in Tourism and the recently published Manuals on Accessible Tourism (2015), produced by ONCE Foundation and the European Network for Accessible Tourism (2015b). Before discussing the papers that have been selected for publication we would like to set the scene by examining some major conceptual and policy development areas that we believe will have a significant influence on accessible tourism futures in the future. These include: dreams and aspirations of people with disability; demography; UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; destination competitiveness frameworks; UD; and the newly adopted UN Sustainable Development Goals for 2030. Each of these areas of influence will now be outlined prior to the papers for the special edition being summarised for their contribution to the future of accessible tourism.\nDefining and conceptualising accessible tourism Conceptualising accessible tourism to reflect all its dimensions and multidisciplinarity is critical for the future. The study of tourism and disability has been a reasonably recent phenomenon with the first detailed examination emerging from the leisure constraints literature (Smith, 1987). From this beginning, a great deal of individual studies are emerged that documented significant issues with demand, supply and coordination of travel for people with disability. More recently the field has started to mature with a conceptualisation that has sought to make sense out of the individual studies and provide an overall framework for understanding the phenomena. To assist with this conceptualisation, Buhalis and Darcy (2011) offer the following definition: Accessible tourism is a form of tourism that involves collaborative processes between stakeholders that enables people with access requirements, including mobility, vision, hearing and cognitive dimensions of access, to function independently and with equity and dignity through the delivery of universally designed tourism products, services and environments. This definition adopts a whole of life approach where people through their lifespan benefit from accessible tourism provision. These include people with permanent and temporary disabilities, seniors, obese, families with young children and those working in safer and more socially sustainably designed environments (adapted from Darcy and Dickson, 2009, p. 34 in Buhalis and Darcy, 2011, pp. 10-11). Importantly the definition recognises collaboration between stakeholders across demand, supply and coordination to recognise that disability is a complex construct involving mobility, vision, hearing, cognitive and other embodiments. The definition recognises that developing inclusive destinations and accessible tourism experiences also benefit other groups in the community. Hence, it contributes toward a greater social sustainability of the industry by including and, hence, providing for a much broader cross-section of consumers that has previously been considered by the industry. In understanding the importance of individuals with disability, the stakeholders they engage with and the influence of UD on the products, services and environments they wish to seek enabling experiences. Buhalis and Darcy (2011) suggests that to develop accessible tourism futures destination managers must strategically plan through the lens of UD. Figure 1 outlines the cyclical strategic approach to engaging UD approaches across disability and lifespan considerations as a foundation for developing future accessible destination experiences.\nDreams and aspirations of people with disability The dreams and aspirations of individuals play a fundamental role in shaping the choices, which lead them to travel. Among people who live with a disability, the idea of leaving behind one\u2019s everyday surroundings and going on a journey can create significant anxiety (Darcy, 1998). People with disability often can design or influence their everyday environment whilst they have routines to negotiate any difficulties and thresholds that exist. This does not apply to new environments whilst travelling, where they do not have prior knowledge, networks or influence on the design nor the potential barriers that are to face and the way to overcome them. Indeed, a recent European survey (GfK, 2015) suggests that up to half of people with disability do not travel on holiday, due to a combination of lack of reliable information, lack of funds and previous bad experiences. Yet, the desire to travel remains with studies showing that it is not a person\u2019s impairment that impedes their travel but a series of interpersonal, attitudinal structural constraints (Daniels et al., 2005; Darcy, 2003). In recognising that a person's impairment does not constrain their travel motivations, the boundaries to what is regarded as accessible tourism destinations and experiences are continually pushed by the accessible explorers who forge new pathways for others to follow.\nMillennium development goals (MDGs) and the UN global compact At the Millennium Summit in September 2000 the largest gathering of world leaders in history adopted the UN Millennium Declaration, committing their nations to a global partnership to reduce extreme poverty and setting a series of targets, with a deadline of 2015. These targets, known as the MDGs are a set of eight specific goals set by the 191 United Nations member countries that have the goal of halving world poverty by the year 2015: Eradicating extreme poverty continues to be one of the main challenges of our time, and is a major concern of the international community. Ending this scourge will require the combined efforts of all, governments, civil society organizations and the private sector, in the context of a stronger and more effective global partnership for development. The Millennium Development Goals set timebound targets, by which progress in reducing income poverty, hunger, disease, lack of adequate shelter and exclusion \u2013 while promoting gender equality, health, education and environmental sustainability \u2013 can be measured. They also embody basic human rights \u2013 the rights of each person on the planet to health, education, shelter and security. The Goals are ambitious but feasible and, together with the comprehensive United Nations development agenda, set the course for the world\u2019s efforts to alleviate extreme poverty by 2015 (United Nations Secretary-General BAN Ki-moon). The aim of the MDGs is to encourage development by improving social and economic conditions in the world\u2019s poorest countries. Since the MDG\u2019s were agreed to significant progress has been made. To date average overall incomes have increased by approximately 21 per cent. The number of people living in extreme poverty declined by an estimated 130 million. Chile mortality rates fell from 103 deaths per 1,000 live births a year to 88. Life expectancy rose from 63 years to 65 years. An additional 8 per cent of the developing world\u2019s people received access to clean water and an additional 15 per cent acquired access to improved sanitation services. In 2015 the UN countries will adopt a new sustainable development agenda and a new global agreement on climate change. The actions taken in 2015 are expected to result in new sustainable development goals that build on the eight MDG\u2019s (United Nations, 2015). Tourism has long been seen as having significant potential to help achieve the MDG\u2019s in developing countries. For example in 1990 developing countries had 18 per cent of international tourism receipts. By 2005 this had risen to 30 per cent and to date it continues to rise. There has been significant promotion of the direct economic links between tourists and the poor. Tourism may provide employment opportunities for marginalised groups, may bring direct income to individual communities and may promote equality in developing countries (Saarinen and Rogerson, 2013).\nUD supports destination competitiveness The tourism industry needs to design and deliver offerings and services that are suitable to all potential users and remove any physical or organisational barriers that can prevent visitation. UD incorporates the accessibility requirements of people with the widest possible range of abilities, so that the greatest number of people can use mainstream products and services without the need for adaptations or special interfaces. Additionally, mainstream products and services should use interface standards which match those of technical aids, so allowing disabled people to access and use mainstream equipment. UD has been defined as: Universal design is the design of products and environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design. The intent of the universal design concept is to simplify life for everyone by making products, communications, and the built environment more usable by more people at little or no extra cost. The universal design concept targets all people of all ages, sizes and abilities\u2019. The Universal Design approach goes beyond traditional design, which tends to focus on the \u2018average\u2019 user. Universal Design is a design approach, reflecting a way of understanding people\u2019s needs. It is not a list of particular solutions, measurements, or products \u2013 Universal Design is the way to reach the solution, contributing to social inclusion (cited in Center for Universal Design, 2009; and first articulated by Mace, 1985). Applying the principles of UD can be seen as a way of developing tourism environments, transportation, services and offers, underpinning sustainable communities and businesses. Today, according to a recent study by European Network for Accessible Tourism (2015a) and partners, less than 10 per cent of tourism suppliers in Europe offer \u201caccessible\u201d tourism services, while demand for such services is set to increase due to the ageing population and continuing upward trend in market demand. Adopting UD enlarges the target markets of destinations as well as ensures that more pleasant experiences can be delivered. Therefore it can increase the market base, reduce seasonality and support the competitiveness of destinations (Buhalis, 2000). Yet, few studies have examined accessible tourism in relation to destination management and only recently has accessible tourism been examined from destination competitiveness perspective (Dom\u00ednguez Vila et al., 2015).\nPapers in this issue To address these concepts and developments this special issue is bringing a range of papers together that discuss research on many accessibility tourism aspects. Naniopoulos and Tsalis (2015) discuss a methodology for addressing the accessibility of monuments. They focus on heritage attraction sites, highlighting the challenges with archaeological sites where interventions become problematic or even impossible. In doing so, they approached accessibility as a dual notion; accessibility of an area and its potential for independent physical access and movement around the monuments as well as perceived accessibility in terms of interpreting, understanding and learning from the environment. The methodology was applied to a number of byzantine monuments as part of a cultural route in the city of Thessaloniki in Greece, as case studies. Results provide both tools for assessing monument accessibility (process orientations and checklists) and insights into the needs of travellers with disabilities for more \u201cusable\u201d heritage attractions. Concluding remarks place a focus on the prerequisites of training and cooperation to allow for the future of accessible monuments to be realised. Tsalis et al. (2015) provide an interesting study on the challenges of implementing accessibility solutions, also within the context of protection, conservation, and management of historical centres and monuments. Viewed from a tourism perspective, archaeological sites and monuments are location bound and exist only in their original place. Hence, access to such sites enables unique and authentic tourism experiences. Discourses on objective, constructive and existential authenticity are of paramount importance when accessibility is concerned. This study provides relevant examples of accessibility interventions on six monuments as well as considerations on the design of the tools that assisted site interpretation and interconnection in a cultural route. Results demonstrate how accessibility improvements can occur while respecting the history, architecture and character of the monuments. The study concludes by emphasizing that it is primarily through providing greater access, that the \u201csocialisation\u201d of these monuments will propagate authentic tourism experiences in the future. Bowtell (2015) offers an examination of the market value and attractiveness of accessible tourism in Europe. Historic data were used to provide a forecast for 2025, while primary data obtained from travel and leisure companies provided insights into managerial perceptions. Findings show a very promising potential for accessible tourism market with significant projected revenues. However, a number of challenges including lack of awareness, cost of investments, complexity of customers\u2019 needs and legal inconsistencies within the EU, create barriers toward developing comprehensive solutions for accessible tourism. Authors provide recommendations on bridging demand and supply. Gillovic and McIntosh (2015) present an interesting study on stakeholder perspectives of the future of accessible tourism in New Zealand. The study provides insights into the current situation and the future propensity for an accessible tourism industry in New Zealand. A number of interviews with key stakeholders revealed that there is a need to develop a culture of accessibility that is perceived as the norm. Findings also include the business and demand arguments, but additionally highlighted the \u201cineptness\u201d of upper industry levels to recognize the opportunity of accessible tourism, exhibiting apathy and complacency instead. Authors conclude with recommendations for the future of accessible tourism in New Zealand which can easily be generalised for other regions. Zajadacz (2015) discusses the evolution of models of disability as a basis for the future development of accessible tourism. A review of medical, social, biopsychosocial, geographical and economic models of disability reveals the theoretical underpinnings and assumptions entailed in those. These are then linked to tourism, demonstrating that different models influence the tourism provision in terms of both products and services. Authors highlight the understanding of disability under different models toward diverse tourism experiences. Several suggestions are offered on the complementary of the models and the implications on the transformation of the accessible tourism industry in the future. Cruces Portales (2015) uses a scenario planning approach to envisage alternative futures for accessible tourism. With a timeframe leading to 2050, four alternative futures are unravelled through storytelling. The scenarios are built on a matrix that includes the opposing forces of empathy \u2013 apathy, and fear of loss and certainty of benefits. The resulting, aptly named scenarios (Eden Gardens, Golden Bridge, Wasted Future and State of Hope) showcase different behaviours, schedules of changes and insights. Authors conclude with strategic ideas and proposals for the future of accessible tourism.\nConclusion When exploring the future of tourism in this area two opposing trends can be observed: future societies are predicted to become more similar, more homogenous as a consequence of consumerism, globalisation and converging urban lifestyles. However, the accessible tourism market is characteristically diverse, with complex needs and the range of dreams and ambitions is boundless. Will future global travellers be able to access more varied and personal services or will increasing numbers of travellers give rise to greater standardization of services? Accessible tourism as an emerging field of study will influence tourism destination competitiveness in the future, whether that be from a human rights, emerging market segment or service delivery perspective. In this conceptual examination, we have presented implications of number of theoretical constructs and lenses through which accessible tourism will be influenced in the future. In this special issue, a number of future dimensions are explored that demonstrate how the field has moved from an examination of the intersection of disability and tourism, to one that is clearly defined through conceptual and definitional approaches as accessible tourism. There is a common thread amongst all the papers presented in this special issue. They focus around stakeholder collaboration, as a foundation for the future development of accessible tourism. It has been explicitly suggested that raising awareness amongst stakeholders is essential to overcome barriers inhibiting the application of solutions that enhance access. The importance of stakeholder collaboration across the accessible tourism value chain has been emphasized in a number of ways in this special issue. Improving accessibility of facilities, transportation, attractions and destinations more generally, demands the collaboration of a wide range of stakeholders including architects, designers, economists, local councils, policy makers, travellers with disabilities, historians and archaeologists to name a few. Therefore \u201csocialising\u201d tourism means that access can be granted only when a number of relevant stakeholders are in accord, work together and specifically developed strategies to target the accessible tourism market. Stakeholder collaboration is a key factor for developing accessible tourism solutions, recognising the value of the market and capitalising on it. Hence, a collaborative approach is required to recognise the complementary nature of the different paradigms; to re-shape and transform the future of the accessible tourism through influencing the tourism industry, contributing government organisations and the not-for-profit sectors. The strength and depth of stakeholder collaborations will determine alternative future realities; from a future where all cooperate and share benefits for all parties, to a fatalistic picture where each stakeholder is sailing alone because they consider their interests incompatible, and everything in between. UD should provide a better accessible tourism future that should enhance the competitiveness of tourism destinations and organisations."}, {"title": "Universal Design Guide for Inclusive Tourism by Scott and Sarah Pruett", "article": "\u201cInclusive tourism is a global movement to ensure the full social participation of all persons with disabilities in travel, citizenships, and cultural contribution \u2013 and in the process, to ensure the same for everyone else.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Scott Rains , srains@oco.net www.RollingRains.com For more on the Pruetts see: Universal Design Partners https://universaldesign.org/"}, {"title": "Finding a way towards high-quality, accessible tourism: the role of digital ecosystems", "article": "By drawing on the concept of digital ecosystems, this paper is amongst the first studies to suggest a path to making tourism locations more accessible to all tourists (with or without disabilities) based on technology.\nThis paper describes a path to fostering accessible tourism, drawing on local authorities, particularly municipalities and universities.

Tourism experience and tourism ecosystem from perspective of tourists with mobility disability 4.1 Mapping the tourism experience through the tourism customer journey The tourism customer journey (TCJ) involves mapping the entire journey of a tourist, outlining all the stages a person goes through when experiencing the need to move for tourism purposes (\u00c5str\u00f8m, 2020). The TCJ draws on the more general concept of the customer journey, which is the \u201cprocess a customer goes through, across all stages and touch points, that makes up the customer experience\u201d (Lemon and Verhoef, 2016, p. 71). Mapping customer journeys is a popular and effective way to grasp the entire tourism customer experience (Rosenbaum et al., 2017). If the tourism product as a whole was offered by one single company, the general customer journey concept could be easily applied to tourism in the same way as it is applied to other kinds of services (e.g. banking, retail and insurance services). However, as will be discussed shortly, tourism is a more complex service because of the number and variety of co-creating actors and the relationships amongst them. Here, we apply the TCJ to the context of people with mobility disability. A similar analysis could be applied to people with other disabilities (Al\u00e9n et al., 2012), resulting in different and specific types of TCJs. Given the complexity of applying a contextual study to all types of disabilities, this study focusses only on people with mobility disability, but the same method of analysis could be easily extended and replicated. From the very beginning of the TCJ, even when individuals are planning their holiday, they will encounter a series of actors, whose number will dramatically increase in the subsequent stages of the journey (Buhalis, 2000; Saraniemi and Kyl\u00e4nen, 2011). This is because tourism involves a complex ecosystem that has many actors who influence to a greater or lesser extent the experience perceived by individuals during their journey (Gretzel et al., 2016). The quality delivered by each actor clearly influences the overall quality of the tourist's overall experience (Ciasullo, 2017). Sometimes this phenomenon is emphasised because the quality performance of one provider has a spillover effect on the customer's evaluation of the quality performance of other components of (or actors in) the tourism ecosystem (Bourdeau et al., 2007). That is, a negative performance in one part of the journey may have a negative halo effect on the entire journey, considering that the tourist (beyond being the focal actor of the ecosystem) (Storbacka et al., 2016) is the only actor to see all the components of the ecosystem. Similarly, a positive performance in one of the moments of truth (Normann, 2001) has the potential to compensate for a series of negative performances in other parts of the journey. Overall, there is a remarkable risk of tourist dissatisfaction, which is heightened when the person undertaking the journey has some form of disabilities, such as when they have reduced mobility. These arguments can be illustrated through the construction of the TCJ for a holiday that is independently conceived and designed by a person with mobility disability who has time to spend in a destination to be selected and does not want to rely on standardised offerings delivered by tour operators. For this purpose, we draw on the general framework suggested by Baccarani and Cassia (2017), according to which a holiday is articulated and occurs in the following four main stages (Figure 1): destination choice and trip design; outbound trip; staying at the destination; transfer to another destination or return home. Each of the four stages of the TCJ develops through the processes that are outlined below. The points marked with the sign (*) in the following list represent critical aspects for people with mobility disability because they can entail various problems related to accessibility because of the presence of architectural, communication, cultural, technological and relational barriers. The first stage of the TCJ \u2013 destination choice and trip design \u2013 encompasses the formation of a tourist's experiential expectations drawing on the following elements: time available for the journey, motivations triggering the need for the journey, any previous personal holiday experiences, any previous indirect holiday experiences (e.g. information collected online, online reviews and e-word-of-mouth), dialogue and interactions with disability organisations and associations, information available online or printed specialised magazines and publications, information available in promotional materials delivered by tourism destinations, means of transportation available and reservation of such transportation (*), type of accommodations available and reservation of such lodgings (*), definition of a hierarchy of suitable destinations (*). The second stage of the TCJ \u2013 outbound trip \u2013 covers the most complex part of the holiday. In fact, the anticipated benefits of the planned holiday take shape during this stage. In the case that the tourist uses a personally owned means of transport suitable for their disability to reach the boarding point and that the travel is done by aeroplane, this stage includes the following elements: printing the boarding pass, estimating the time that they must leave home to reach the airport (this estimation is informed by customers' sensitivity to risk and the information available), preparing their luggage, planning which road or highways to take to reach the airport, stopping at rest areas to meet their needs or the needs of others or to comply with the requirements of the transport providers (*), parking in an area near the airport (*), checking in their luggage (*), reaching the boarding point (*), complying with any safety control procedures (*), waiting at a boarding gate (*), boarding the aeroplane (*), flying to the destination (*), disembarking and claiming their luggage (*), searching for a local means of transport to reach the accommodation facility (*), arriving and being welcomed at the accommodation facility (*). The third stage of the TCJ \u2013 staying at the destination \u2013 represents the core of the holiday with all that a person desired for their time away on holiday. This is a stage of personal enhancement in relation to seeking knowledge, values and relationships. During this stage, the core value of the holiday emerges and is influenced, at least in the beginning, by the travel experience, which may increase or diminish the initial enthusiasm. This stage encompasses the following points and involves a variety of actors at the destination: planning itineraries, visits and activities that the tourists wish to engage in at the destination based on their previous knowledge and the information available to them, visiting cultural, artistic and natural sites in an area (*), forming relationships with the host community (*), selecting from a variety of foods and eateries on offer (*), participating in local guided tours (e.g. wine tours) (*), using local means of transport (*), purchasing souvenirs. The fourth stage of the TCJ \u2013 transfer to another place or return back home \u2013 is similar to stages two and three described above, and includes the overall evaluation of the perceived quality in relation to the expected quality developed in stage one. In addition to the steps described above, which imply a variety of relationships between the tourist and several different actors, the context of a holiday is even more complex because tourist safety and care must be specifically assured, particularly for PwD. These conditions must be guaranteed by higher-level welfare systems, with which the tourism service network should be able to cooperate effectively. In summary, in this TCJ the tourist benefits from a variety of services that globally support the creation of the tourism experience, which is phenomenologically determined and perceived by the beneficiary (i.e. the tourist) (Vargo and Lusch, 2016). 4.2 Identifying the tourism ecosystem in relation to tourists with mobility disability This subsection identifies the actors that form the complex tourism ecosystem in its co-creation of the tourism experience. During each of the four stages of the TCJ, many different actors contribute to the formation of the overall tourist experience by delivering or not delivering the expected quality. In the tourist's experience, all these actors form a tourism service ecosystem, even if they represent only a set of services that the customer has assembled (Baccarani and Cassia, 2017). In fact, a service ecosystem implies a self-contained, self-adjusting system of resource-integrating actors connected by shared institutional arrangements and mutual value creation (Vargo and Lusch, 2016). However, this level of coordination amongst all the actors involved in the co-creation of tourism experience does not yet exist. Below, we outline the actors involved in each of the four stages of the TCJ. In the first stage, the tourist imagines, designs, plans and anticipates the pleasure of their holiday. To complete this stage, the tourist relies on the information provided by actors such as airlines and accommodation providers and interact with them directly or through intermediaries. For people with mobility disability, the dialogue and interactions with disability organisations and associations play an important role. As highlighted by the UNWTO, disabled peoples' organisations (DPOs) play a key role in accessible tourism because \u201cthey are mediators in understanding specific needs, existent barriers and the ways to bridge them\u201d (UNWTO, 2020). At this first stage of the TCJ (destination choice and trip design), quality is evaluated on the basis of the completeness and clarity of the information provided by multiple actors. All the actors involved in this first stage of the TCJ represent the holiday-design ecosystem (see Figure 3). In the second stage of the TCJ (outbound trip), at least the following 12 actors are involved, and this number could be even higher if a tourist decides to use public means of transport (instead of a personally owned means on transport): producers of publications or websites and intermediaries distributing information that guides the tourist in selecting the destination during the season in which the journey takes place; booking organisations through their websites; transport providers, including those preparing the service timetable; highways operators who have information about roadworks and any related delays; firms executing the roadworks who have information about any interruptions that may affect the roadworks and travel times; firms managing the rest areas and a variety of other services that may be required; firms managing the parking areas who may assist customers to reach their boarding point after having parked their vehicle; airport company that manages the departure airport that offers a welcome service and controls safety processes; airline that is responsible for checking in passengers, assigning boarding gates, flying times and delivering baggage; airport company that manages the arrival airport that offers welcome services and provides information to customers and about local means of transport; local transport service operators; accommodation services providers. Therefore, a tourist interacts with at least 12 different co-creating actors during the second stage of the TCJ. These actors are connected in the tourist's mind but they are practically linked only through market relations and they do not coordinate their decisions and behaviours. Thus, it is unlikely that the tourist will be able to complete the second stage without experiencing some level of difficulty. For example, the tourist may miss the flight because of planned roadwork not being properly notified in advance or because of other unforeseen events. To evaluate the quality of the overall experience, the tourist considers all the components of this stage of the TCJ, comparing expected and actual quality. In particular, the tourist will appreciate the problem-solving capability of the actors. This second group of actors represents the travel ecosystem (see Figure 3). In the third stage of the TCJ (staying at the destination), the tourist stays at the chosen destination where they interact with at least the following actors: firms who manage welcome and accommodation services; restaurateurs; local inhabitants (local community); local transport service operators; local merchants with their value propositions; agencies who organise local tours so that customers can explore local traditions, culture and products; municipalities; organisations protecting tourists' safety and care. This third stage of the TCJ has fewer actors than the second stage. However, the variety of actors is greater because during the tourist's stay at the destination, the tourist will engage in activities such as trying different types of food offerings to appreciate the local food culture, which means they will have contact and engage with more actors. Similarly, to explore local artistic, natural and cultural heritage, the tourist will select from a variety of opportunities that are available at the destination. In the third stage of the TCJ, the local community also plays a fundamental role in welcoming tourists and in co-creating their tourism experiences. In fact, in addition to the technical and functional\u2013relational components of the quality delivered by local services (Gr\u00f6nroos, 1990; Kang and James, 2004), the welcoming atmosphere experienced at the destination plays a central role in the formation of the overall perceived quality (Nunkoo and Ramkissoon, 2011). All the actors involved in the third stage of the TCJ represent the staying at destination ecosystem (see Figure 3). The fourth stage (transfer to another place or return back home) is a replication of the stages two and three outlined above and encompasses the tourist's comparison between the overall perceived quality and the expected quality developed in stage one. The actors that populate the tourism service ecosystem are largely the same for tourists with and without disabilities. However, tourists with disabilities can select amongst a smaller number of offerings than tourists without disabilities. Moreover, actors are required to have adequate technical and relational skills to deliver tourism services to tourists with disabilities. Thus, tourists with disabilities must face greater difficulties in their travel-related choices because of the presence of several types of barriers (see Figure 2). The tourism ecosystem described in this sub-section is depicted in Figure 3. The quality of the tourism experience emerges from the relationships established within this tourism ecosystem through which resources are combined and value is co-created. Such relationships have different degrees of smoothness depending on the presence of several barriers.\n5. Barriers to accessible tourism: can digital ecosystems represent a solution? Drawing on the arguments developed so far, this section identifies in detail the barriers to fulfilling tourism experience co-creation for PwD. The intention of the discussion is to understand whether and how digital ecosystems could represent a viable solution to such barriers. The identified relationships amongst the co-creating actors have not been harmonised to deliver the overall quality desired by the tourist because they are regulated by pure competitive mechanisms, emphasising the value of a specific part of the ecosystem instead of the value of the entire ecosystem. However, in tourism, competition amongst companies of the same sector can exist only once a territory as a whole is attractive. As highlighted in several studies (Baccarani et al., 2019; Barnes, 2004), the territory is not a physical space, but a highly complex viable subject emerging from all co-creations over time through the interactions between nature and human beings. Thus, the territory emerges from the relational synergies between the people who inhabit it and the environment. Therefore, the stronger the synergies established in a certain location, the higher the location's attractiveness and value, which then make the location a platform in which individual actors can compete against each other with their propositions. That is, the long-term attractiveness of a territory and of a tourism destination derives from the actions of the entire ecosystem, within which the actors must aim to do their best through a continuous dialogue with the territorial ecosystem. For this purpose, tourism must be conceived in a holistic manner by deploying planning efforts that involve all the actors of the ecosystem and engage all the potential beneficiaries of the tourism offering \u2013 be they are tourists with or without disabilities (Darcy et al., 2020). This perspective cannot ignore a series of barriers that determine biases in the co-creation of a location that provides tourism services for all tourists and particularly for those with mobility disability. In detail, the following barriers to accessible tourism can be identified (Gillovic et al., 2018; Michopoulou et al., 2020; Nyanjom et al., 2018): informational barriers; architectural barriers; political barriers; cultural barriers; relational barriers; technological barriers; entrepreneurial myopia. These barriers are outlined below from the perspective of PwD. Informational barriers refer to the difficulties that a person with disabilities faces when desiring to autonomously evaluate and choose a means of transport, accommodation, a holiday itinerary or simple holiday activities such as shopping. While there is usually a great deal of information is available for such services, informational needs of PwD leads to higher levels of complexity. For example, even when information about tourism services is available it can difficult to verify. Architectural barriers refer to the obstacles PwD encounter on holiday when engaging in activities such as accessing means of transport, moving in different locations, and using sidewalks and roads. Inconveniences related to architectural barriers can often also be experienced by people without disabilities (e.g. finding it difficult to understand the subway system) but the barriers are emphasised for PwD. Architectural barriers are directly connected to political barriers, which refer to the needs of PwD in the context of a political agenda. While political discourses highlight the ideal of acting to eliminate architectural barriers, political actions are often guided by urgency, short-termism and narrow-sighted electoral benefits. Cultural barriers refer to the indifference that can characterise the behaviour of all people of all abilities (Gillovic et al., 2018) towards PwD. This barrier is manifest in factors such as the lack of respect for PwD parking slots. Relational barriers refer to the general population viewing PwD from a self-righteous perspective, believing that the PwD cannot live a full life, even within the constraints of the experienced impairments. Technological barriers refer to the speed of the technological change related to means of transport and communication, which can create difficult situations for those who do not keep up with the ongoing changes. Entrepreneurial myopia refers to the inability to appreciate the size and value of the tourism market for PwD and of changes occurring in public opinion. This myopia is in tension with the ideals of sustainability provided by Agenda 2030 (United Nations, 2015), which explicitly highlights the need to promote sustainability and inclusivity and to empower PwD (e.g. points 11 and 23 of Agenda 2030) and by the Global Code of Ethics for Tourism (UNWTO, 2001), which states the \u201cright to tourism\u201d (article 7). When accessible tourism experiences are designed, it is important to avoid ad-hoc solutions aimed exclusively at PwD (Scheyvens and Biddulph, 2018). Following the principles of universal design (Michopoulou et al., 2020), tourism providers should in fact enable experiences that are useable by all people, with or without disabilities. This approach is consistent with the idea that tourism carries a value that makes it a public service, interpreted as a service that should be assured for every member of communities that desire such services. The question now arises of the assessment of the potential of digital ecosystems to remove the identified barriers and enable effective accessible tourism experience co-creation. While it is clear that technology cannot solve all the problems, we contend that it represents a valuable engine for such effective co-creation. As noted by Akaka and Vargo (2014), technology should be conceived as an operant resource able to bring about changes in ecosystems and influence value co-creation processes. The provision of a platform to support the engagement of actors involved in accessible tourism can thus represent a first step to first removing informational and relational barriers, and over time, smoothening other barriers (e.g. cultural barriers). Thus, technology can enable the emergence of a digital ecosystem with tourists and their needs as the focal actors (Gretzel et al., 2015, 2016). Such an ecosystem could initially organise and coordinate suitable solutions to emerging PwD needs and issues by collecting and sharing the information concerning all the actors of the ecosystem. Given that tourism is a service provided by a specific territory, the digital ecosystem should be led by the authorities in charge at the territorial level, whether a municipality, province, region or country. Given that the emerging ecosystems require rapid efficiency and effectiveness checks, it seems more appropriate that the process begins at the local territorial level and then extended (through imitation and adaptations) to higher levels. Beyond authorities in charge at the territorial level, universities and other research institutes should play a central role in the design of a tourism ecosystem. These institutions should establish a dialogue with tourists, with PwD and with disability organisations and associations, without overlooking local inhabitants who are important for creating a warm and smooth welcoming. The emergence of the tourism ecosystem also draws on the constructive contributions of all the organisations representing the service providers who play a role in co-creating tourism experiences. The digital ecosystem should also be based on a series of incentives for firms that decide to be a part of the ecosystem, beyond a process of certification and evaluation of their delivered quality. As a good starting point, municipalities could establish tourism departments that have the additional responsibility for the removal of mobility barriers. The viability of this choice is demonstrated by the experience of Verona, the first (and currently the only) municipality in Italy that has introduced such a department. For smaller municipalities, the digital ecosystem could be created at a higher level, such as in a consortium of municipalities, a province or a region. Figure 2 presents the main features of the tourism digital ecosystem. Overall, the establishment of a digital ecosystem aims to make the territory an inclusive, warm and welcoming location where people want to live or stay. Hence, by providing an engagement platform, technology can act as an operant resource, disrupting the myopia guiding each actor's individual behaviours. An example of a digital ecosystem to support accessible tourism is the one being implemented by Explora, the destination management organisation of the Lombardy region (Italy). Explora has begun to establish a digital ecosystem (Ecosistema Digitale Turistico della Lombardia) through a platform that aims to support information sharing amongst the actors of Lombardy's tourism ecosystem. This ecosystem has not been created specifically to support accessible tourism. However, through this platform, operators could coordinate and harmonise the design of accessible tourism experiences, which would then be communicated and sold through the related web portal \u201cin-lombardia.it\u201d. This web portal currently hosts dozens of accessible tourism experiences; however, these are not conceived following the concept of the holistic ecosystem described in this paper. Nonetheless, the technological infrastructure that has been created has the ability to foster the future emergence of such a holistic accessible tourism ecosystem."}, {"title": "Universal Design and Tourism: Why it\u2019s crucial that we focus on accessibility", "article": "In a world where 15% of the population is living with some form of disability and where our population is also steadily ageing it is more important than ever to consider universal design in every industry planning to be operational in our ageing future.\nThe World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) understands this crucial importance and have called for more investment and improved management for disabled tourists globally.

Check your travel insurance\nFrustratingly, travel insurance costs more simply because you have a disability \u2014 but it\u2019s very important to get the right cover; listing long-term medical conditions and chronic illnesses will save you a fortune if you need medical attention on holiday. Remember that additional insurance to protect mobility aids may also be needed. Shop around for your insurance, a comparison website can show you the best deal depending on how much assistance you need.\n2. Pack enough medication\nAnd check that you can take it into the country you\u2019re visiting. Remembering your medication could be the difference between a good break away and a bad one. Cut down your chances of losing medication when you travel by packing it in separate bags \u2014 one lot in your suitcase, one lot in your hand luggage \u2014 it will mean you\u2019ve always got some to hand no matter what.\nSome countries limit how much of certain types of medication you can carry on one person at one time; strong painkillers are often restricted so get a dispensation letter from your doctor if you need one.\n3. Check with your GP for any extra immunisations\nWe all need jabs when we go to certain destinations but, with particular health conditions, you may need more. It\u2019s definitely worth booking an appointment with your GP or registered nurse to make sure you\u2019re covered.\nHollie-Anne Brooks in Paris\n4. Check you\u2019re fit to fly\nYour GP should also help check that you\u2019re fit to fly. Don\u2019t forget any extras you may need to take with you such as compression socks, spare feeding tubes or masks.\n5. Get a free (or discounted) space for your carer or PA\nTravelling often means having to take a personal assistant with you and if you need multiple carers this can soon add up. Thankfully, you can get discounts \u2014 and often get free spaces. Eurostar, for example, only has wheelchair spaces in standard premier or business class but you will get these at the price of standard tickets; this includes one seat at standard price for your carer too.\n6. Remember all your mobility aids\nMany of us use different mobility aids for different days. If you\u2019re an ambulatory wheelchair user, are you also going to need to take a walking stick with you? Do you need different mobility aids to cover all terrains you might experience on your trip?\nAn airport lift for passengers who use wheelchairs (Getty Images)\n7. Familiarise yourself with the procedure for checking-in mobility aids\nDon\u2019t panic about being without your wheels when flying. Your wheelchair will be stored with the luggage and you\u2019ll be given another to transport you around airports at either end and to and from your seat. If your personal wheelchair or mobility aid comes with specialist storage instructions or needs to be handled in a certain way, make sure the airline knows and you know where, when and how your mobility aid will be returned to you.\n8. Use websites like AccessAble to plan your trip\nAccessAble provides full reviews and information about everything from where the accessible public toilets are in a city to which hotels offer accessible spa access. Plan ahead, including where you are going to eat, and make sure any companies you book through are aware of your access needs and have ramps, working lifts, braille menus and anything else you may require.\nEuan\u2019s Guide provides similar reviews and allows disabled people to leave reviews of different aspects of their visit to certain attractions, so you can get a first-hand account of what you\u2019re about to experience.\n9. Use a specialist travel agents\nSome travel agents, such as Travel Counsellors, specialise in creating incredible accessible travel experiences. If you\u2019re unsure where to even begin, use a specialist agency who can cover everything for you from booking your transfers to and from the hotel to whether the swimming pool has a hoist to which spas have wheelchair accessible treatment rooms.\n10. Consider renting a mobility device\nMany hotels, museums, cruise ships and holiday resorts have mobility scooters and wheelchairs that you can often rent free of charge or for a small fee. Airport assistance will be able to transport you around the airport in a wheelchair or on a buggy and, once you arrive at your destination, check out the range of mobility aids on offer to help get you round the resort.\nMake sure your hotel room has space for your service animal to work, rest and play (Alamy)\n11. Make sure your accommodation has enough room for your service animal\nIf you\u2019re travelling with a service animal, such as a guide dog, make sure the hotel room you\u2019re provided with has enough room for your animal to work, rest and play. Look for hotels with large grounds so you can walk your animal and know your rights \u2014 it is illegal for anyone in the UK to turn away someone with a guide dog, whether that be when entering a taxi or going to a restaurant.\n12. Take an extension lead\nA multi-plug extension lead will become your best friend on holiday; if you\u2019ve got an electric wheelchair to charge and other pieces of equipment that require electricity then the one plug socket that\u2019s not by the bed isn\u2019t going to help. Take an extension lead so you can plug your equipment into multiple holes and have the power connected right next to where you need it.\nSee our pick of the best hotels with accessible rooms\nWhile you\u2019re there\n13. Pace yourself\nIt can be tempting to take part in a tonne of activities, visit all the museums and galleries and spend the night working your way through the cocktail menu but it\u2019s important to remember to pace yourself to keep your health in its best shape for as long as possible.\n14. Embrace train and airport lounges\nOn Eurostar, for example, all disabled people can use the business lounge whether you\u2019re travelling business class or not. I like to use this time to familiarise myself with my itinerary, as well as enjoy the perks such as free snacks, wine and beer.\n15. Use your blue badge\nWe may not be in the EU anymore but your blue badge for parking that you use in the UK is still valid across the EU. Outside of the EU, different rules apply so make sure to check the country\u2019s driving and parking rules ahead of time to avoid a potential fine.\n16. Check foreign public transport\nNot all transport abroad will be as equipped for disabled people as what we\u2019re used to in the UK. Check to see if you need to book assistance or make any other amendments.\nWhere can I travel without a vaccine?"}, {"title": "Travelling with mobility and medical equipment", "article": "If you use an electric mobility aid such as an electric wheelchair or scooter, you will need to give the airline some information in advance about the equipment, including its make and model.

Can I take my liquid medication on board the aircraft? Normally passengers may only take liquids past the security search point provided that they are in containers which hold not more than 100 ml. All liquids containers must be put in one transparent and re-sealable bag, which must not be larger than one litre in volume (approximately 20cm x 20cm). Suitable bags are usually available at the airport before you go through security. You will usually only be able to fit about five 100ml containers into a bag of this size. If you are not able to fit all of your essential medicines, including inhalers and liquid dietary foodstuffs, into the bag, or if they are supplied in containers larger than 100ml, you may still be allowed to carry these in your hand baggage. Before your trip you will need to: Contact the airline to make sure that they know that you will be carrying extra liquids and to check if they have any extra requirements.\nIt is also advisable to check if the airport you are flying from has any extra requirements.

Extra supplies and larger containers of medicine can go in your hold baggage. Additional information may be found on the Direct.gov website: Direct.gov My medication needs to be kept cool. Can I put it in a refrigerator on the aircraft? Many aircraft either do not have refrigerators or have chiller cabinets which are cooled by 'dry ice' and are unsuitable for storage of medication such as insulin. The chiller cabinets and refrigerators are intended for storage of food only and most airlines will not allow medication to be stored in them. If your medication does normally need to be kept cool, speak to your doctor or pharmacist about how best to store it during your journey. Most modern insulins can safely be kept at room temperature for a period.

All batteries, including any spare batteries, must meet the airline requirements for carriage, whether carried as hand baggage or in your hold baggage. (Please note , spare lithium batteries must be carried in the cabin. They are not permitted in hold baggage). Even where an electrical supply is available on the aircraft, it will not be guaranteed to be available throughout the flight and you should carry back-up in the form of batteries if necessary.

Some devices have been tested and approved for use throughout flight but you must contact the airline well before the date of travel, to make sure that they know that you will be carrying the medical equipment and to check if they have any additional requirements.
