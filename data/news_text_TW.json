These recommendations aim to guide the decision-makers of natural resources in tourism in undertaking accessibility improvements. The document has a particular focus on facilitating access to protected areas, beaches and parks. The WCPA Tourism and Protected Areas Specialist Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT), acted as the expert reviewers. Their involvement was key in identifying the best actions geared towards a greater extent of accessibility and inclusiveness within nature areas, vis a vis tourism. The guidance tool, whose drafting was led by UNWTO, the ONCE Foundation and UNE, is part of the promotion of ISO Standard 21902:2021. Download here the guidelines in English and Spanish.\nRecommendations for cultural tourism key players on accessibility UNWTO, Fundaci\u00f3n ONCE and UNE issued in September 2023, a set of guidelines targeting key players of the cultural tourism ecosystem, who wish to make their offerings more accessible.\nThe key partners in the drafting and expert review process were the ICOMOS International Cultural Tourism Committee and the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT). The ICOMOS experts\u2019 input was key in covering crucial action areas where accessibility needs to be put in the spotlight, in order to make cultural experiences more inclusive for all people.\nThis guidance tool is also framed within the promotion of the ISO Standard ISO 21902, in whose development UNWTO had one of the leading roles.

Just as other guidelines on the UNWTO series, this document will be revised in 2021 with relevant accessibility partners.\nReopening Tourism for Travellers with Disabilities:\nHow to Provide Safety Without Imposing Unnecessary Obstacles In partnership with the ONCE Foundation of Spain and the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT), UNWTO suggested in July 2020 a set of practical steps to ensure accessibility for all, under the new circumstances. \u201cReopening Tourism for Travellers with Disabilities\u201d provides recommendations for destinations and service providers to accommodate customers with disabilities and specific access requirements, including seniors.\nAccessible Tourism Destination The \"Accessible Tourism Destination\" was launched in 2019 by UNWTO and the ONCE Foundation, to recognize and promote accessible tourism destinations. The ATD is an annual UNWTO distinction based on an Expert Committee evaluation, which acknowledges destinations enabling a seamless experience to any tourist, regardless of their abilities. The first ATD was awarded in 2019 and has been temporarily put on hold, given the pandemic.\nVideo \"Change your destination\" The video \u201cChange your destination\u201d was issued by Fundaci\u00f3n ONCE and UNWTO by the occasion of the 2019 International Fair of Tourism (FITUR). Facilitating travel for people with disabilities is an exceptional business opportunity. Yet, a change in mind-set and in the model of tourism services provision is needed in order to meet this major market demand. Accessible environments and services contribute to improve the quality of the tourism product and can create more job opportunities for people with disabilities. Accessibility, therefore, must be an intrinsic part of any responsible and sustainable tourism policy and strategy.\nWorld Tourism Day 2016: \"Tourism for All - promoting universal accessibility\" To mark the celebration of the World Tourism Day 2016 under the theme \"Tourism for All - promoting universal accessibility\" UNWTO, the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT) and the Spanish ONCE Foundation for the Social Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities have produced a compilation of Good Practices in the Accessible Tourism Supply Chain. While these examples provide a small sample of possible solutions regarding accessibility, they will hopefully inspire others to take steps towards broadening the availability of accessible offers in tourism destinations around the world.

While trips are on pause during the pandemic, Seable Holidays will bring them back in summer 2022.\nEasy Access Travel\nDebra Kerper and her team at Easy Access Travel accommodate most types of physical disabilities in their solo trips and mixed group tours. While Kerper sometimes relies on her own experiences as a traveler in a wheelchair, she says every trip needs to be tailored to an individual client\u2019s needs. To do so, the team spends time getting to know their clients to match them with the best vacation choice, and visits hotels and tourist spots for inspection, takes cruises beforehand, and collects information from trustworthy sources to ensure a safe, accessible, and fun experience.\nPlanet Abled\nNeha Arora\u2019s Planet Abled arranges customized tours for people with different types of disabilities, and also plans group tours that include non-disabled people. Their trips mostly take place in India and South East Asia, with plans to expand to countries in Europe, and popular activities include river rafting, skiing, trekking, and wildlife safaris. Some of their extra touches include assigning a travel buddy for the blind, seeking special permission from museums so clients can touch and feel the articles on display, and arranging for sign language interpreters for the hearing impaired.\nWheel the World\nAlvaro Silberstein, the CEO of Wheel the World, was paralyzed from the chest down after surviving an accident at 18.

To find accessible hotels, first search for hotels in your destination, and then check the \u201cIncreased accessibility\u201d box in the \u201cAmenities\u201d filters on the left-hand side of the page. This filter reveals properties that offer these features: wheelchair accessible, facilities for disabled guests, in-room accessibility, accessible rooms, facilities for disabled guests, and disabled access.\nPlaya del Carmen, Mexico\nOne hour from Canc\u00fan International Airport, Playa Del Carmen is a far cry from its more revelrous neighbor, yet still has accessible hotels and an accessible beach furnished with beach wheelchairs. There\u2019s even adaptive equipment to allow you to go snorkeling to enjoy the coral reef and green turtles. But the main reason for coming here is to visit the nearby and largely wheelchair-accessible Mayan archaeological sites, Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 and Tulum, a rare chance for the mobility-impaired to get up close to ancient ruins.\nSan Diego skyline from the harbor \u00a9 David Toussaint / Getty Images\nSan Diego, California, USA\nWith the Americans with Disabilities Act having just celebrated its 30th anniversary, much of the USA\u2019s infrastructure is accessible, but our pick is San Diego. Laid out along the classic grid system, generally flat and with a fully accessible trolley system, it also boasts a balmy year-round 64-80\u00b0F climate.\nThe historic Gaslamp Quarter is very wheelchair friendly, as is the massive Balboa Park (incorporating the slightly hilly San Diego Zoo), but it\u2019s the miles of beachfront promenade with beach wheelchairs available \u2013 including a motorized one with caterpillar tracks at Mission Beach! \u2013 that are the main attraction.\nBarcelona, Spain\nWith the national tourism authority and Catalonia in particular pushing accessible travel, it\u2019s no surprise that wheelchair users have been flocking to Barcelona. With 80% of the metro stations and 100% of buses wheelchair-accessible, as well as a relatively flat and cobblestone-free old city, getting around is a breeze.\nWhat\u2019s more, wheelchair users not only jump to the front of the queue for attractions such as the breathtaking Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, they often get in for free! You can explore the length of La Rambla and get around the famous Mercat de la Boqueria; even the beach has wheelchair access and people on hand to help.\nWelcome to Las Vegas \u00a9 Michael Phillips / Getty Images\nLas Vegas, Nevada, USA\nLas Vegas is undoubtedly one of the most accessible cities for people with disabilities in the US. Of course, the casinos and the venues hosting world-renowned musicians and shows are all wheelchair accessible, as are the vast majority of sites and attractions, many of which \u2013 like the Fountains of Bellagio and the Fremont Street Experience \u2013 are completely free.\nMore surprising, perhaps, the High Roller \u2013 the tallest observation wheel in the world, which takes 30 minutes to do a full revolution \u2013 is also wheelchair-accessible. And if you\u2019re after an adrenaline rush, wheelchair users can even enjoy the SlotZilla Zip Line and the Zoomline, which reach speeds of up to 35 miles an hour, or a hot-air balloon ride over the city.\nAdd to this a very wide choice in accessible accommodation, easy exploration along the wide sidewalks of the Strip, a fully accessible bus service that serves all parts of the city, and plenty of wheelchair-accessible taxis and you can begin to understand why Las Vegas has become something of a destination for wheelchair users.\nManchester, UK\nAlthough it was the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, much of central Manchester was rebuilt in the late 1990s, making smooth, wide, step-free pavements, as well as stepless entry into shops, restaurants and bars the norm \u2013 ideal for anyone with mobility requirements.\nNorthern England\u2019s cultural hub is well served by accessible public transport, leaving you free to pay homage at Old Trafford, learn about our industrial roots at the Museum of Science and Industry or shop with the goths at Affleck\u2019s.

But there are a number of tour operators that cater to travelers with disabilities. Motor-impaired travelers can enjoy scuba diving, 4WD off-road driving, traditional Sicilian fishing and olive oil making \u2013 not to mention the gastronomic delights normally associated with Italy. Indeed, two Guinness world records have been set here: first paraplegic to dive to 59m and first blind woman to dive to 41m!\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania, USA\nAs one of the oldest cities in the US, you might not expect Philadelphia to be very accessible \u2013 but it is! While the Old Town may offer some challenges for wheelchair users, sidewalks are generally well maintained in the more touristed areas, with plenty of curb cuts and tactile markings.\nThis is particularly useful for wheelchair users considering most of the city\u2019s attractions are within a two-mile radius of the City Hall. The subway, opened in 1907, is only partially wheelchair-accessible, as is the overland rail network, but unfortunately the aging trolley system is not. However, the city\u2019s fleet of more than 1000 buses are all low-floor and wheelchair-accessible, as is the PHLASH tourist bus which runs a continuous loop downtown, stopping at many popular attractions, and costs only $5 for an all-day pass.\nNeedless to say, all of the city\u2019s most popular attractions \u2013 including Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell, Love Park and the Philadelphia Museum of Art \u2013 are fully wheelchair-accessible despite their antiquity. And when it comes to finding accommodations, there are plenty of wheelchair-friendly options right in the center of the action.\nSandridge Bridge in Melbourne, Australia \u00a9 Catherine Sutherland / Lonely Planet\nMelbourne, Australia\nWith its highly accessible public transport system and compact city center, Melbourne is one of the most accessible cities in the world.

Discover Melbourne\u2019s best wheelchair-friendly restaurants, enjoy spectacular scenery along the Great Ocean Road, and visit one of the world\u2019s best zoos as well as many of the parks that progressive Parks Victoria is opening up to visitors with access needs.\nLjubljana, Slovenia\nSlovenia\u2019s flat and largely pedestrianized capital, served by accessible electric vehicles, is well worth a visit. Most of its buses are accessible, but the city is so small, with plenty of ramps and curb cuts, you might rarely need them.\nThe city\u2019s main drawcard, the 16th-century Ljubljana Castle is reached via a funicular (free for people with disabilities and a companion) or train, both wheelchair-accessible. Many of Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik\u2019s famous bridges have recently been made accessible, and were joined in 2010 by the award-winning Butchers\u2019 Bridge, which allows wheelchair users access to boats.\nSingapore has established accessibility requirements into its city code \u00a9 Ninnat Fongsupa / 500px\nSingapore\nSingapore has to be the most accessible city in Asia and one of the most accessible cities in the world. Its universal code on barrier-free accessibility, in place for decades, plus increasing affluence have resulted in an infrastructure with stepless access to most buildings and no shortage of curb cuts.\nAlthough power wheelchair-friendly taxis aren\u2019t common, the accessibility of the mass rail transit (MRT) and buses makes them unnecessary. In Singapore, the question is not \u201cwhat is accessible?\u201d but rather \u201cwhat isn\u2019t?\u201d \u2013 from its street food hawker centers to its marvelous zoo.\nVienna, Austria\nLike many European cities, Vienna is steeped in history, being the center of the former Habsburg Empire and the musical heart of Europe. Unlike many of its counterparts, however, its cobblestones have been removed, as have many of the curbs.\nThe refurbished city is both flat and compact, with most central shops and cafes fully accessible. Getting around is relatively easy with elevators to the metro and plenty of low-floor trams. Most museums and places of interest are fully accessible, including the must-see Schloss Sch\u00f6nbrunn.\nYou might also like:\nTake a spin around the globe with an accessible travel expert\nWhat I have learned from travelling the world with a wheelchair"}, {"title": "Accessible tourism", "article": "Accessibility of tourism for disabled people\nNehantic Trail - Rhododendron Sanctuary Trail entrance and Wheelchair-accessible sign\nAccessible tourism is the ongoing endeavor to ensure tourist destinations, products, and services are accessible to all people, regardless of their physical or intellectual limitations, disabilities or age.[1] It encompasses publicly and privately owned and operated tourist locations. The goal of accessible tourism is to create inclusivity of all including those traveling with children, people with disabilities, as well as seniors. This allows those with access requirements to be able to function as an independent using products following the universal design principle, a variety of services, and different environments.[2]\nBackground [ edit ]\nOverview [ edit ]\nAccessible tourism is defined as a way of making tourist locations more accessible to all populations. It does not just encompass those with disability, but it includes people of all populations including those with children and the elderly.[3] The tourism industry is continuously evolving which has led to a need for accessibility. Because of this, it has also led to an increased market for accessible tourism.[4] With the rise of the independent living movement, seen in places such as Berkeley, California, it has also raised questions about the definition of the landscape and the people within it. The rise of this movement in turn created a demand from the population to modify the city to allow for greater and equal access for everyone.[5]\nModern society is increasingly aware of the concept of integration of people with disabilities. Issues such as accessibility and universal design[6] are featured in the international symposia of bodies such as the European Commission.[7] Steps have been taken to promote guidelines and best practices, and major resources are now dedicated to this field.\nA greater understanding of the accessible tourism market has been promoted through research commissioned by the European Commission where a stakeholder analysis has provided an insight into the complexities of accessible tourism.[8] Similarly, the Australian Sustainable Tourism Cooperative Research Centre funded an Accessible Tourism Research Agenda[9] that sought to outline a research base on which to develop the supply, demand and coordination/regulation information required to develop the market segment. The research agenda has now seen three other funded projects contribute towards a research base on which the tourism industry and government marketing authorities can make more informed decisions.[10][11][12]\nAs of 2020, approximately 15% of the world's population lives with some form of disability, with one-fifth of the total, or between 110 million and 190 million people, living with a disability that affects daily life.[13] Based on a report in 2011 by World Health Organization and the World Bank, over 1 billion of people in the world had some disability, with 200 million of those who have experienced severe difficulty in functioning.[14]\nIn addition to the social and health benefits,[15] the market represents an opportunity for new investment and new service requirements, rarely provided by key players in the tourism sector.\nAccording to ENAT, the European Network for Accessible Tourism, accessible tourism includes but is not limited to:[16]\nBarrier-free destinations : infrastructure and facilities\n: infrastructure and facilities Transport : by air, land and sea, suitable for all users\n: by air, land and sea, suitable for all users High quality services : delivered by trained staff\n: delivered by trained staff Activities, exhibits, attractions : allowing participation in tourism by everyone\n: allowing participation in tourism by everyone Marketing, booking systems, web sites & services: information accessible to all\nBrief history and trends [ edit ]\nThe shift from the medical model to the social model of disability had a major contribution in the development of the concept of accessible tourism. With the Disability Rights Movement in full swing in the mid to late-1900s, the traditional view of disability that focuses on the individuals' impairments and the medical interventions to fix those impairments was significantly challenged.[17] The newly emerged social model of disability postulates that disability is not constructed solely by a medical condition a person has but rather by the social environments that impose various kinds of barriers on people with impairments.[18] With the influence of the social model, the general understanding of disability has been expanded to place greater emphasis on removing the socially imposed barriers and achieving greater accessibility for individuals with disability and various access needs. This endeavor to create a more inclusive environment for all people led to the emergence of the concept of Universal Design, which is the design of products and environments that can be easily accessed, understood, and used by anyone, regardless of one's ability. In 1997, the 7 principles of universal design were developed.[19] These principles include:\nEquitable Use\nFlexibility in Use\nSimple and Intuitive Use\nPerceptible Information\nTolerance for Error\nLow Psychical Effort\nSize and Space for Approach and Use\nThe principles of universal design provided important conceptual foundation and guidelines for the tourism industry on how to design tourism products and services that have the value of inclusivity at their center.[20]\nToday, Europe and the United States of America are home to the majority of the existing companies in the accessible tourism industry. However, companies worldwide are starting to appear as the result of a growing need, largely driven by senior tourism, due to increasing life expectancy in developed countries. The United States requires ADA compliant ramp access to virtually all businesses and public places.[21] Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, Germany, France and other northern European countries are increasingly prepared to receive tourists in wheelchairs, and to provide disability equipment and wheelchair accessible transport.\nWith the growth of the internet, online travel planning is also becoming more common, leading to the rise of online accessibility maps. For example, starting in 2016, Lonely Planet started offering online accessibility resources by country.[22] As for the future of accessibility tourism, b predicts that, \"emerging field of study will influence tourism destination competitiveness in the future, whether that be from a human rights, emerging market segment or service delivery perspective\" ( Michopoulou, Darcy, Ambrose , & Buhalis, 2015).\nRegulations [ edit ]\nMany individual countries have legislation designed to support the needs of people with disabilities, but the closest thing to an international standard for accessible tourism would be Article 9 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). Since its adoption on December 13, 2006, the CRPD has gained 164 signatories and was the fastest human rights treaty to be enacted. The convention was designed to combat many of the challenges that people with disabilities face through legal protections of rights and freedoms, increased access to services that facilitate independent living, decreased discrimination and stigmatization, and raised awareness of disability-related issues. Article 9 focuses specifically on accessibility and what is required to provide people with disabilities with equal access and opportunities to participate in every aspect of society. Not only do these accommodations benefit the disabled citizens of the countries that are a part of the CRPD, but they also improve the experiences of disabled travelers and tourists.\nTypical accommodations that are beginning to become implemented globally to improve accessible tourism include, but are not limited to:\nAccessible travel-related websites\nReliable information about a specific attraction's level of accessibility\nProfessional staff capable of dealing with accessibility issues\nAccessible airport transfer, vehicles, and public transportation\nAccessible restaurants, bars, and other facilities\nTechnical aids and disability equipment such as wheelchairs, bath chairs, and toilet raisers available when making living arrangements\nAdapted restrooms in restaurants and public places\nAccessible streets, sidewalks, and building entrances/exits\nAccessible communication systems\nSpecific accommodations [ edit ]\nAlthough this is not an exhaustive list of possible accommodations related to accessible tourism, the examples below demonstrate some solutions to common problems that people with disabilities experience while traveling."}, {"title": "Travellers with disabilities", "article": "Disabilities do not have to make travel impossible. Most high-income nations have implemented strict requirements for accessibility by law in recent decades, and the US legislation on that topic even served as a model for a UN agreement. That being said, some places \u2013 whether through carelessness or lack of resources or historical restrictions \u2013 are rather hard to access for people with some disabilities. Common problems include sidewalks marred with potholes and or blocked by poles protruding at odd angles, which make walking a challenge even for the healthy and greatly inhibit mobility in a wheelchair, insufficient or non-existent public transit infrastructure, unthoughtful currency design, and needlessly noisy restaurants.\nBlind and visually impaired [ edit ]\nCrossing with tactile paving\nGetting in [ edit ]\nIn most parts of the world, airports and train stations are generally manageable places for a blind or visually impaired person with reasonable mobility skills, except for the navigation problems caused by fast-moving crowds. Plan extra time to get from one place to the other, and let the teeming hordes pass you by. For airport security, you'll need to know what you've put on the scanner to be X-rayed, and how to describe it when it comes out the other end. If they have a question about some of your hand luggage, then you won't be allowed to touch it to confirm that it's yours before they've double-checked it. So if a security officer vaguely asks someone in your direction, \"Is this yours?\", be ready to say that you brought a black wool jacket, a MacBook Air laptop, a black leather briefcase, and an iPhone in a silicone rubber case.\nThe quality of bus service varies much more, and your next stop after the plane or train may be the local bus or a hotel shuttle bus. Some cities have speaking buses, accessible apps that you can download to plan your route, and braille labels on the stop buttons. In other places, you have to rely on the driver to tell you what bus you're getting on, which direction it's going, and when it's your stop.\nIf you have some vision, then mark your luggage in a way that will let you identify it. There won't be too many people with their suitcases covered from edge to edge in a large X or other shape made with neon pink duct tape. If you need something that doesn't rely on vision, then consider a specialized electronic speaking device or a tactile pattern, perhaps made of knots in thin rope very securely wrapped around the handle.\nOnce you're there [ edit ]\nThere are a few hotels that specialize in blind and visually impaired guests. These hotels provide high-contrast features, talking elevator controls, room keys that make it easy to tell which end goes in first, and otherwise understand what makes your life simpler. However, the odds are that you'll be arriving at a typical hotel. In that case, tell the hotel about any requests you have when you make your reservation. Whenever possible, speak to the local hotel staff about their facility before reserving your room, rather than relying on a central call center. When you arrive, the check-in process will likely be the same as any other transaction, right down to the detail of needing to explain to the clerk how to position your signature card or asking him to use the top edge of your credit card to indicate the bottom edge of the signature line. Ask someone to walk you to your room, at least the first time, so that you can orient yourself, check for nearly invisible glass doors and other obstacles along your route, and also figure out the room key. Some hotels deliver a newspaper to each room in the morning. This tripping hazard can usually be stopped or held at the front desk for you upon request.\nIf you use any specialized computer tools, such as a screen reader or software for zooming, then bring your own laptop, braille notetaker, or other electronic devices. You almost certainly won't find what you want in an internet caf\u00e9. Ask hotel staff to point out where the electrical outlets and sockets for internet cables are located in the room.\nIf you're traveling for work, you may not have time to do much else. But if you are on holiday or otherwise expect to have some time, then consider your options. Ask the hotel staff for help finding your preferred form of transportation, as well as for general advice. If you're interested in your destination, try signing up for a guided tour, so that you can hear the tour guide describe the history and culture. Large history and art museums sometimes hold special hands-on tours for blind and visually impaired people. A gift shop that sells scale models of famous local buildings and monuments may let you touch them, so you can better understand the places you've just visited.\nYou may also be able to get useful advice about your destination from the local blindness institute at your destination.\nGuide dogs [ edit ]\nIn general, travel should be planned for well in advance when traveling internationally with a guide dog. As dogs can carry diseases, special testing, vaccination and paperwork is required in many countries, especially island countries. Countries with such requirements include the UK and Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Sweden, Norway, and Finland. The US state of Hawaii has very similar requirements, which are more strict than those in use on the US mainland.\nMany countries allow guide dogs where dogs are not normally allowed (e.g., inside a restaurant, on public transit), while most developing countries don't have laws permitting guide dogs in public places, and locals may not distinguish the difference between pet dogs and guide dogs, causing troubles when entering places where pet dogs are forbidden.\nDeaf and hard of hearing [ edit ]\nSome fire alarms use flashing lights as well as sounds.\nTravellers who are deaf or hard of hearing (HOH) may benefit from some specific features, such as lights on fire alarms. If you can't hear fire alarms, then always tell the hotel staff about your hearing situation when you check in.\nAlmost all restaurants, especially in areas with significant international travel, can take orders from diners who merely point at what they want on the menu. An increasing number of casual restaurants allow ordering online for takeout or delivery, which reduces the risk of miscommunication.\nA few restaurants and stores have employees that use sign language. If you're traveling near a large school for deaf and HOH students, you are likely to find more establishments that are accustomed to patrons who can't hear well. For example, if you're near Washington, D.C., then it may be worth a trip across town to its Near Northeast district, to be near the businesses that cater to students and staff from the famous Gallaudet University.\nNoise is a problem in many restaurants, and it can affect everyone. Most restaurants will do their best to accommodate people who want to be able to hold a conversation, so it's worth asking if a quiet table is available. The makers of the SoundPrint app, which aims to crowd-source noise ratings for American restaurants, say that American Chinese and Indian restaurants tend to be less noisy than other types of restaurants in the US.\nMobility impaired [ edit ]\nWheelchair ramp to a shopping mall in Johor, Malaysia.\nInfrastructure for the mobility impaired varies widely. When considering destinations, looking at cities that have hosted the Olympics (and Paralympics) is a good starting point. Wheelchair ramps and accessibility are part of the preparation. Developed countries tend to have better infrastructure to support travellers with reduced mobility than developing countries. However, some public transit systems like the Paris Metro have poor accessible design, despite serving the capital of one of the wealthiest countries on Earth. Newly constructed infrastructure tends to keep accessibility in mind during the design phase while older infrastructure often do not.\nIn many developed countries some categories of establishments, including most public services, are required to be accessible by wheelchair. Even so, it may be good to call in advance, as the door to use may be a locked back door, or it may be temporarily blocked by roadworks.\nParking placards from your home country may be recognized in other countries.\nThe permits used for getting to use dedicated parking are partly standardised; a tag from a member country of the International Transport Forum should be valid in nearly all of Europe and North America and in a dozen countries elsewhere under the reciprocal recognition of parking badges resolution.\nDepending on your travel goals, your everyday access methods may not be the right choice. Even if you can usually get by without a wheelchair, jetlag and other fatiguing effects of travel, as well as a desire to keep up with the rest of your group, might make a wheelchair desirable some times. Most airports offer wheelchair service to disabled passengers, and many large attractions, such as amusement parks, keep a small number of wheelchairs and baby strollers on hand for use by patrons on the premises.\nEquipment for wheelchair users to enter and exit the water (Syros, Greece)\nAdditionally, a wheelchair that works well in your home area might not carry you over the terrain at your destination. Some people will find it cost-effective to buy a specialized chair, but many others will benefit from renting them. Powered trackchairs that can handle forest floors usually cost more than US$10,000, but they can be rented in some places for as little as $100. The rickshaw-styled single-wheel Jo\u00eblette wheelchairs are popular with hiking families all over Europe, and they can be rented in some public parks for a nominal fee. Wheelchairs with wide balloon tires to navigate sandy beaches often cost more than $1,000, but some beaches rent them at a low cost. These are generally manual chairs that require someone else to push the chair. Because this specialized equipment is key to seeing your destination, and because most parks only keep one chair on hand, contact your destination in advance to confirm that any advertised equipment is still available and in good working order, to make sure that it is suitable for your needs, and to ask whether it can be reserved in advance.\nSpecialized wheelchairs for travelers\nSingle-wheel rickshaw-style wheelchair for hiking, usually pulled by one person and pushed by another\nAll-terrain, powered, tracked wheelchair used for hunting\nBeach wheelchair with wide tires\nAutism [ edit ]\nA sunflower lanyard can be worn to signal hidden or invisible disabilities to trained transit staff.\nTravellers with autism (including Asperger\u2019s Syndrome) often feel overwhelmed by noise and general \"hustle and bustle\". Airports and trains often have a lot of noise. A pair of noise-cancelling headphones can muffle the sound, while a fidget spinner can be a distraction. Some airports have sensory areas or quiet rooms to provide a calming environment. Inquire ahead of time if a hotel offers autism-friendly rooms, which reduces the anxiety of travellers who are extra sensitive to the changes of the new surroundings while travelling.\nTravellers with autism are often vulnerable to scams, as they can find it more difficult to tell when someone is lying to them. Having a solid understanding of typical local crimes and scams, and practising how to respond to strangers, may help counter scams. The basic point is that you in this context should ignore most strangers who claim to need help and those who offer help you did not look for. If somebody needs help, some locals are better equipped to provide it.\nFatigue [ edit ]\nRegardless of whether your fatigue is caused by a sleep disorder, an autoimmune disease, heart disease, or something else, there are several strategies that can help you have a successful trip. The first is: whatever things really work for you at home, whether that's following a particular diet, only doing one \"big\" thing every other day, taking a nap each afternoon, or something else, don't leave those strategies at home.\nPlan ahead. This includes all of the usual travellers' plans, like where to eat and what sights to see, but also find out things like whether you need to make reservations in advance and whether they can be cancelled without penalty if you run out of energy. Consider travel insurance if you think the whole trip might need to be cancelled. If airplanes wear you out, plan for a day to recover when you get there. If you can recharge on a train or in a car, then you might be ready to go as soon as you arrive. When you are thinking about travel, think about all of it: the hour-long drive to the airport, the two hours in the airport, the four hours on the plane, the half-hour waiting for your checked luggage, and so forth. Have a plan for dealing with jetlag if you're changing time zones. Keep your plans flexible and not too crowded. It's better to plan to see one museum, and have some backup options in case you're having a particularly good day, than to plan to do three things, and feel disappointed that only two happened. Remember that the most memorable moments aren't usually the headline attractions, but instead are the unexpected, unplannable moments of joy. Visiting the Louvre may be a life goal, but you may remember other moments \u2013 a new favorite flavor of ice cream, the silence after a snow storm, that still-warm baguette, the ladybug on a child's finger \u2013 with more clarity later. Remember that you are not doing travel \"wrong\" if your plans involve relaxing in a comfortable spot instead of rushing back and forth between popular tourist activities. Be realistic about your energy and abilities, and factor that in to your plans. If your trip has one main goal in mind, such as an amusement park or a large museum, you might be able to save money by buying discounted end-of-day tickets or by getting a multi-day or annual pass. These may permit you to visit the destination for a couple of hours each day for the same cost as a few long and exhausting days.\nConsider the demands of your destination. If you don't fare well in the heat, then either pick a cooler time to visit or plan for ways to stay cool. Make sure that hotels, restaurants, and vehicles have air conditioning. If you need to be out in the heat, look into cooling vests and other specialized equipment. Layers of clothing, such as two thin T-shirts instead of one heavy one, can let you adjust to changing temperatures.\nPack everything you need, and nothing else. Make a list and check it twice, especially if your fatigue makes it difficult to remember a thousand little details. Depending on your destination and your needs, you might find it more convenient to ship some things to your destination in advance, or to rent it locally so that you have less luggage to bring with you. Keep medication, water, safe snacks, and any necessary equipment, such as a walking stick or a pillow, with you.\nTake advantage of services that are intended to help you. For example, call the airline or cruise line and arrange a wheelchair ride. If you can afford it, hire people to help you, such as a local tour guide or a driver. Can someone else wash the laundry or help with getting ready to leave or returning home?\nIf you're traveling with other people or if you are visiting friends and family at your destination, have a conversation well in advance, so that everyone has the same expectations about your energy budget. Tell them what's important to you and what you'd like them to do when you need to rest.\nRespect [ edit ]\nParking space for mobility impaired in Malaysia\nKeep the following in mind when travelling with or meeting a fellow traveller who happens to be disabled.\nIf you need to interact with a person with disabilities, then speak directly to that person, in the same manner that you would speak to any other stranger whom you would like to make a favorable impression on. For example, do not ask a blind man's children what he would like to do; ask him directly.\nDo not touch people with disabilities, or any of their equipment or other belongings, without getting their permission first. \"May I help you with that?\" is more polite than grabbing their things. Be prepared to have your offer of help declined.\nPeople all have varied interests, and once practicalities have been taken care of, a person's disability is seldom the most important thing in their life. Someone in a wheelchair may prefer to spend the day at a bird sanctuary rather than attend a wheelchair race, and a blind person might prefer discussing the local culture and history of a town rather than the absence of braille on the museum exhibits. Don't ask how or when they became disabled. This can be perceived in a rude way and they\u2019re probably bored with telling that story already. Do ask the same things that you would ask any non-disabled person, which includes small talk about your adventures with fellow travellers and requests for advice about local sights and restaurants from people who are familiar with your destination. Don't make jokes or say clever things. They have already heard all of them, from \"Don't run over me in that wheelchair\" to \"I sure wish I could board the plane first\", hundreds of times. These types of jokes are also considered very poor etiquette.\nThere is no need to talk loudly or slowly to blind people. They can hear you well enough.\nDo not pet, feed or otherwise distract a guide dog without first asking the owner's permission.\nThough ignorance, laziness and arrogance probably could be classified as disabilities, they are self-inflicted and do not qualify one to occupy a disabled parking space. These parking spaces are reserved to make it easier for someone in a wheelchair, or who uses crutches or a cane, to enter and exit a vehicle. At the same time, if you see someone walking from a disabled space alone with no apparent difficulty, don't jump to the conclusion that the person is not qualified to occupy the space. Disabled parking permits are often available to many people who don't use wheelchairs, but have other conditions that seriously limit their mobility (such as a leg amputation, certain cardiac or respiratory conditions, or chronic severe pain). The driver may also be going inside to pick up the person who is entitled to use the space, and assist that person in entering the vehicle.\nMost people rarely give a second thought to toilets because they are always there and easy to use, but for a person with mobility limitations, using a standard toilet can be very difficult or even impossible. Check on toilet facilities before planning an outing.\nCountries information [ edit ]\nWheelmap has information about wheelchair-accessible places in many countries. The information is rather basic with 3 levels: All rooms accessible, some rooms accessible, not accessible.\nLonely Planet created a free resource for finding accessibility information by country called Accessible Travel Online Resources (free PDF download through store).\nCanada [ edit ]\nIn Canada, legislation that regulates federal accessibility standards was passed in 2019, with varying grace periods. The regulation includes interprovincial bus routes, train service and airlines. For Ontario, the building codes, and rules for transportation and service providers to improve accessibility, will be fully enforced by 2025.\nThe European Union tries to set common accessibility standards, especially in new construction and public transit. Most bus operators and many train operators should be able to accommodate people in wheelchairs, though more rural stations may lack elevators and legacy platforms may not have the right height for current rolling stock.\nThe Euro banknotes and coins are intentionally designed to be easily recognizable by touch. While the ten cent coin is slightly smaller than the five cent coin, it is easily distinguished by its ridge. Similarly the fifty cent coin, while bigger than the one Euro coin, has a different ridge as well. Also, banknotes increase in size as the denomination increases.\nFinland [ edit ]\nGeneral awareness of accessibility issues is quite high, although in practice there are still many problems. Most public facilities and many private ones have arrangements for people with wheelchair or hearing aids. Anyhow it is a good idea to call in advance to check any special arrangements (such as entry by a locked back door) and have company that can help with unexpected problems.\nToilets designed for use with a wheelchair are common where there is more than one toilet. Public buildings and modern shopping centres should be fairly safe bets. Bus and railway stations also used to be, but since the 2000s they have all too often been closed or repurposed, even in big towns.\nService dogs are accepted also in shops where dogs in general are not allowed. Many traffic lights have audible signals. On buses there is usually a reserved seat behind the driver, but in practice that seat may not have space for the dog but in the aisle. Ask the driver (any fellow passenger can help with translation, if needed). Service dogs generally travel for free, also on the railways, where you should include them on your ticket (you might want to buy the ticket by phone or at a desk rather on the net, to have the personnel handle the booking interface).\nWhere finding a parking lot may be hard, there are often parking space reserved for people with disabilities. There is a special permit to use these parking lots. Foreign permits are recognized, given they have the international symbol.\nThe railways have wheelchair-accessible cars on most routes; sleeper cars each have one cabin for a person with disabilities and his or her assistant. Assistance can be ordered in advance, from the platform to your seat; conductors will help you on the train itself. If you have a personal assistant (any adult) travelling with you, he or she gets a free ticket, provided you are in wheelchair or have an accepted certificate. Call \u260f (domestic calls free) for details.\nLocal buses are usually equipped for wheelchair access (and using the buses is free at least in some cities, also for a person assisting). Coaches, on the other hand, usually cannot handle wheelchairs, other than by putting collapsible ones in the luggage compartment; you will need your own assistant to get to a seat.\nTaxis usually charge extra if you have a wheelchair or need significant assistance. On the other hand, the elderly and people with disabilities belong to their most important customer groups, so most drivers will be very helpful and professional.\nMets\u00e4hallitus (\"Forest Administration\"), which manages the national parks, gives information on accessibility for each destination, many of which have trails accessible by assisted or motorized wheelchair. Often, the trails are too steep to cope on your own in a normal wheelchair. The other trails are often too rough for people with even minor mobility impairment. The exhibitions and services at visitor centres are usually accessible.\nThere are specific regional SMS emergency numbers for those that cannot communicate by voice. These are not posted on the Internet. Enquiries to \u260f .\nJapan [ edit ]\nACCESSIBLE JAPAN offers information for tourists with disabilities and other mobility issues with sections including general information, a database of accessible hotels, tourist attraction reviews, equipment rentals and more. They have also published a tour guide book for Tokyo, Accessible Japan's Tokyo: All you need to know about traveling to Tokyo with a disability.\nHEART BARRIER gathers a database of wheelchair-accessible restaurants and shops all around Japan. They include details like slope width and slope, which are not included in Wheelmap.\nPeru [ edit ]\nWheelchair tours of Machu Picchu are available, as are accessible tours of the Inca Highlands. Apumayo Expediciones is the most established accessible tour operator in the area.\nSouth Africa [ edit ]\nSee also Disabled travel in South Africa\nUnited Kingdom [ edit ]\nThe gap between some platforms and the train doors is uncomfortably large even for people with no disabilities.\nAccessibility in the UK is generally good, although there are challenges. For example, train station platforms frequently do not align with the train doorway, sometimes by more than a foot (0.3 m). Assistance is available at most train stations, but you'll want to arrive in plenty of time to make arrangements.\nDeliberate discrimination against individuals with disabilities is prohibited in law, with many popular destinations and venues having gone considerably beyond the 'reasonable' adjustments required. For example, Bournemouth offers not only beach access through concrete ramps down to the beach, but also beach wheelchairs to rent, charging stations for electric scooters, and beachside elevators during the day. In the Yorkshire Dales, barriers have been removed on certain, mostly short, routes in the Miles without Stiles program, to create routes that have appropriate gradients and surfaces for people with mobility impairments.\nUnited States [ edit ]\nWhile the U.S. for the most part is very good at accommodating disabled travelers, one glaring exception is money for blind travelers. While coins can be distinguished relatively easily by touch, the physical sizes of the coins do not consistently relate to the value of the coin. Most notably, the dime (10 cents) is physically the smallest coin. The situation for paper currency (notes) is even worse for the blind. All denominations are the same physical size (unlike the euro, in which the notes increase in physical size as the denomination increases), and there are no tactile features that enable blind people to readily distinguish different denominations by feel. A redesign of each U.S. note that would include a tactile feature to better accommodate people who identify currency by touch has been delayed until 2028 at the earliest and probably several years later for the $20 bill, which is one of the most commonly used. In the meantime, the American Foundation for the Blind has published a guide detailing alternative ways to identify currency."}, {"title": "Planning an accessible trip?

When you book, it's a good idea to call and note if there are any physical limitations you'll need help with \u2014 such as boarding a plane with a wheelchair. Also, call again 48 hours before your trip to confirm any assistance arranged at booking, and mention it again at the check-in counter.\nRelated: Air travel tips for wheelchair users\nResearch contingency plans before you go\nTalk to your doctor before your trip to discuss any specific concerns, get any doctors' notes required for travel and arrange for any medication refills you may need before you go (you'll want to pack more than you need of any medication, and it should go in your carry-on bag for easy access).\nAdditionally, research the area where you're traveling, and have contact information for doctors' offices, pharmacies and hospitals in case of emergency.\nIt's also not a bad idea to look into comprehensive travel insurance that includes medical coverage while you're abroad."}, {"title": "Accessible Travel Press", "article": "Accessible Travel Press\nHelp us share our content to reach more travelers around the world"}, {"title": "Accessible travel holiday guide", "article": "Hostility, not hospitality Tourists with access needs have too many sorry tales about their travels.

Now that restrictions are largely a thing of the past and travelers are free to move about the world, people are once again turning to travel for inspiration, relaxation, and the opportunity to experience something new.\nIt goes without saying that those opportunities should be available to everyone, regardless of race, gender identity, or sexual orientation.\u00c2\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been in the travel industry for more than 15 years\u00e2\u0080\u0094some might even say I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m an expert in the field. As a cisgender heterosexual white male, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m acutely aware that I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t experienced the hurdles or prejudices others have when traveling to certain destinations.\nHowever, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen first-hand how travel connects people and bridges divides, and I want that experience for others. As a leader in the travel industry, I feel like it is my duty to ensure that everyone has a good experience, and that means helping every traveler feel safe and welcome on every trip.\nWorking with destination marketing organizations, I have learned how destinations can create safe, welcoming, and inclusive spaces for diverse travelers. Here are some ways destination marketers can support that vision.\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nIntegrate values that match up with the needs of diverse travelers.\u00c2\nJust like with other products, travelers are \u00e2\u0080\u009cshopping their values.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They want inclusive, accessible destinations where they know they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll feel safe and welcomed. According to a recent survey from Accenture, approximately three out of every five travelers want their travel providers to share similar diversity and inclusion values.\nWhen LGBTQ+ and ethnic minorities responded, that number increased to nearly three out of every four travelers. In today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s market, travelers are no longer willing to compromise their beliefs, which means destinations must prioritize diversity and inclusion to create the right reputation and win travel bookings.\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nEnsure authenticity for your destination through collaboration and accessibility.\u00c2\nDiversity and inclusion go well beyond marketing; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a way of life and a belief system that requires destination marketers to think about the messaging they're putting out and what kind of destination they want to be. You must become advocates for both your destination and the travelers you want to attract, and advocacy isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just about race or gender.\nIt also includes abilities, such as making places wheelchair accessible or safe for those with autism, and meeting the diverse needs of all travelers. Above all, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to be authentic. This level of grit, sweat, and passion goes way beyond a hollow tagline. Travelers will see through any attempts to woo them without substance.\u00c2\nOne of the best ways to be authentic is to have open-minded conversations and learn from travelers who are looking for inclusive destinations. Rather than making assumptions or boxing in travelers, speak directly to Black, Latino, Asian and LBGTQ+ travelers to find out what they really want and embrace who they are. Travelers everywhere want the same thing\u00e2\u0080\u0094to feel included, safe, and able to explore without prejudice.\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nConnect with travelers along their journey throughout your destination.\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the best way for you to put your best, most inclusive foot forward? First, learn which travelers are coming to your destination. You likely have diverse travelers visiting your destination, so find out who they are and what they want and find ways to accommodate and inspire them.\nFor example, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re attracting LGBTQ+ travelers, you could put on more LGBTQ+-friendly events, which will naturally encourage travelers to return and attract new travelers. The best way to do this is to band together. Embracing diversity is a collective effort, so work with hotels, restaurants, and attractions in your destination to ensure travelers will have the same inclusive experience wherever they go.\nIn addition to knowing your travelers and working together, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to have the right toolkit. For example, Destinations International is creating diversity and inclusion toolkits for destinations. Your website is the face of your destination and a huge part of your toolkit, so periodically review your content. Do you use inclusive language? Would a traveler feel safe and comfortable when visiting?\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nDestinations leading the charge in making travel accessible for all.\nA number of destinations are working diligently to ensure travelers from all backgrounds feel safe and accepted. New York City\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website is rich with options for all travelers, ranging from The Black Experience to halal-friendly options and AAPI leaders.\nBoston recently launched its All Inclusive campaign, offering insights into Boston\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cultural diversity and helping travelers understand their options for accessibility around the city.\nThis year, Cleveland celebrated Freedom Fest in honor of Juneteenth, while Baltimore continues to celebrate its diverse population. Regardless of the destination, there are so many incredible ways to showcase diverse populations and traditions while welcoming travelers from all backgrounds.\u00c2\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nEnsuring inclusive and accessible environments into the future.\nI am proud to be part of an industry that connects human beings and helps us realize we are all the same. Travel is the best weapon to break down ignorance and judgment barriers. It is inspirational to witness destination marketers leading the charge to promote diversity and inclusion and make travel accessible to all people.\nBy creating inclusive, safe environments, DMOs are positioned to lead the charge in making sure travelers can explore the world in which we live.\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d"}, {"title": "Inclusive Travel: The Importance of Getting Tourism Right", "article": "The number of international tourist arrivals surpassed 1.3 billion in 2017, generating an equal $1.3 billion in tourism spending. According to the UNWTO, the gains were led in part by a 9 percent increase in international arrivals in Africa.\nAt a time when so many booming industries are technologies, tourism has become a powerful people-driven economic force, and with that power comes a massive responsibility. In many parts of the world, inequality is widening and wealth increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few. Tourism\u2019s potential for inclusivity presents an opportunity to distribute the economics of a booming global industry more broadly, to communities and people who not only have not benefited from tourism before but may face limited options for building better livelihoods for themselves and their families.\nOur upcoming Africa Travel Summit reminds us of how critically important it is that we get the tourism opportunity right. If done well, the benefits will stay within the communities in which the travel occurs\u2014distinguishing travel from many other industries that have found riches in Africa and exported them elsewhere. For us at Airbnb, the two-day summit will be a chance to hear and learn from some of the continent\u2019s most visionary entrepreneurs in travel and technology. The Summit is part of our $1 million commitment, announced in 2017, to expand tourism in Africa in ways that are local, authentic, sustainable, geographically diverse and yes, demographically inclusive\u2014what we call \u201chealthy tourism.\u201d\nTo help our broader community beyond Africa engage with the Travel Summit, Airbnb will showcase the work of African content creators, highlight African destinations and celebrate African hosts on our global social media channels for the week.\nAlso this month, you can join us in following Jessica Nabongo, who is now nearly 70 percent of the way toward becoming the first black woman to visit all 195 countries and states in the world. A dual citizen of both Uganda and the US, Jessica is using her Ugandan passport as well as her American one in order to raise awareness of outbound African tourism and the mobility gap between US and African passports. We\u2019ll be engaging with Jessica as she travels to Lebanon, Cyprus, Jordan and Beijing.\nBut opportunities to make sure underserved communities can benefit from inclusive travel aren\u2019t exclusive to developing countries\u2014they can be found in the world\u2019s most advanced economies.\nAirbnb\u2019s Srin Madipalli, Suzanne Edwards, and the rest of the team formerly of travel startup Accomable are working with our staff and local governments in the UK and Japan to find ways to expand both hosting and travel opportunities for people with disabilities.\nFor the start of Hispanic Heritage Month on September 15, Airbnb\u2019s own Juntos employee resource group will host a fiesta to celebrate our local employee, vendor, host and guest community and raise awareness of Latinx issues. We\u2019re also sponsoring 25 students as they attend the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute\u2019s Leadership Conference in Washington, DC, a gathering designed to empower young Latinx to take on issues affecting the US Latinx community.\nThis month also brings the second anniversary of Airbnb\u2019s anti-discrimination report, issued on September 8, 2016 as our first step\u2014of what we know will be many\u2014toward eliminating bias wherever possible from our platform. At Airbnb, we are committed to fighting bias through inclusion. Our ability to provide guests with an inclusive travel experience can only start with Airbnb being an inclusive travel company, looking internally and externally for opportunities to champion diversity and rid the platform of potential discrimination. We also believe that inclusiveness is self-perpetuating. As our CEO and Head of Community Brian Chesky often observes, when we travel and experience new surroundings and cultures, we realize people are 99-percent the same.\nAmong the many other initiatives we launched in releasing the report was Instant Book, an opt-in feature for hosts that reduces the potential for bias by allowing any guest to book a listing without securing prior host approval. While we have much more work to do here, I am pleased to report that two years after we launched the feature, Airbnb now offers 3 million listings, 60 percent of our inventory, that are instantly bookable.\nWe also recently took a step toward fulfilling our commitment to diversifying our senior leadership by appointing our first woman board member, Ann Mather, an incredible leader from Pixar and Disney and current board member of both Pixar and Alphabet. Ann joins former American Express Chairman Ken Chenault as our second independent board member.

Developing an inclusive & accessible system\n2. Creating safe spaces\n3. Designing an engaging & relevant system\n4. Exemplifying inclusion & accessibility\nHighlights from these important guidelines include providing training to staff on disability awareness and how to support travellers with disabilities, as well as collaborating with other businesses in areas where there are gaps in accessibility knowledge, experience, and services.\nThe report also emphasises the importance of fostering a respectful environment at all locations and for all activities, specifically reminding staff that their attitude towards people with disabilities plays an integral role in making that customer feel welcome and included.\nThere is also an importance given to developing accessibility features that are clear, overt, and which such travellers do not require special assistance from staff to use.\nFurthermore, the guidelines make clear that businesses should regularly and proactively engage travellers with disabilities in the creation of accessible products and services so that these meet their needs appropriately. They should also include accessibility features from the booking process, enabling travellers with disabilities to engage with the business before booking their travel service or product.\nStaff should also be empowered to address customer concerns as they occur or to engage other staff members if and where necessary, and inclusive marketing should be developed to dignify representations of all people and authentically represent them.\nGloria Guevara, President & CEO, WTTC said: \u201cWTTC is proud to release these important high-level guidelines, which will help Travel & Tourism businesses of all kinds, foster more accessible and inclusive environments.\n\u201cThe Travel & Tourism sector is one of the most diverse in the world. As the report shows and according to the World Health Organization, almost everyone will temporarily or permanently experience disability at some point in their life, and about 15% of the global population live with some form of disability. It is therefore imperative that we are inclusive.\n\u201cFurthermore, throughout its very nature, the sector promotes cultural exchange and understanding, therefore it makes perfect sense that we reflect these values within the sector as well. We look forward to seeing these guidelines make real change within the workforce.\u201d\nPeter Kern, Vice Chairman and CEO, Expedia Group said: \u201cTravel opens minds and drives better understanding between people from different cultures and identities, but sometimes travel isn\u2019t inclusive of or accessible for people with disabilities or accessibility needs.

Yet while the travel industry has made some strides toward becoming more inclusive, diverse, and accessible, there\u2019s still work to be done.\nExpedia Group\u2019s mission is to power global travel for everyone, everywhere. To help realize this vision, we started by looking inward to ensure that we are reflecting the diversity of our travelers and modeling the inclusive mindsets that make travel a force for good. We understand the importance of not only practicing inclusion, but also empowering our partners to do the same.\nThat\u2019s why we commissioned custom research to understand how consumers feel about inclusive travel, and how they believe the current travel landscape stacks up. Conducted with Wakefield Research, the study surveyed 11,000 representative consumers in 11 countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, the UK, and the U.S. Our findings are included in a new Inclusive Travel Insights Report to help your brand practice inclusion better, promote diversity, and provide equal access to all travelers. Below is a snapshot of the report.\nAccessibility and diversity in travel\nOne aspect of inclusion is ensuring equal access to all travelers. This is especially important as Baby Boomers are expected to be a growing traveler segment while also experiencing age-related health issues. Our research shows that 54% of this generation finds accessibility in travel is very important, 5% more than the general population.\nAs for diversity, our research shows that 7 in 10 consumers would choose a destination, lodging, or transportation option that is more inclusive to all types of travelers, even if it\u2019s more expensive. This means they are willing to spend more on travel that\u2019s truly inclusive.\nHotel advertising that can reach any traveler, anywhere Travelers looking to book a hotel use multiple channels to find their ideal place to stay, from social media to travel websites, and more. This is why it\u2019s imperative that you know when \u2014 and where \u2014 to reach the right traveler. Whether you\u2019re trying to reach early-bird or last-minute bookers, our targeting capabilities can help you connect with the right traveler at the right time. Connect with your target audience\nLocal culture and community in travel\nIt\u2019s also important for the travel industry to be inclusive of local cultures and communities, and for travelers to pay attention to their interactions with them. Indeed, our research shows that over 1 in 3 consumers are looking for information on ways to engage, recommendations for supporting indigenous cultures, and ways to spend time volunteering while traveling.\nIn fact, 74% would choose a travel option that supports local cultures and communities, even if it was more expensive.\nRepresentation in travel marketing\nClearly travel marketers have an opportunity to do better, to help all travelers and destination communities feel represented. This is important not only because it\u2019s the right thing to do, but also because it\u2019s better for business.\nAccording to our research, 78% of survey respondents said they have made a travel choice based on promotions or ads they felt represented them through messaging or visuals. For Millennials that figure is even higher \u2013 84% have made a travel choice based on representation in travel advertising.\nExamples of inclusive travel marketing campaigns\nSo what does representation in marketing look like? Here are a couple examples of partners that worked with us to help share their commitment to inclusion in their travel advertising.\nVisit Panam\u00e1\u2019s \u201cThe Next Turn\u201d Features Blind Adventurer\nOur research shows that 92% of consumers think it\u2019s important for travel providers to meet the accessibility needs of all travelers. But travel shoppers may not know if a destination they are considering can accommodate them.\nThat\u2019s why Visit Panam\u00e1 partnered with Expedia Group Media Solutions and our award-winning creative team on a new video series called \u201cThe Next Turn\u201d to promote the destination. One episode features Amar, a blind traveler, who experiences a rainforest, volcano hike, and coffee farm in Panam\u00e1 through his sense of hearing, smell, taste, and touch. This campaign showcases how travelers with different abilities can immerse themselves in the amazing experiences Panam\u00e1 offers.\nTourism Malaysia Promotes Local Culture\nAnother way to practice inclusion is to respect local cultures and help improve the livelihoods of host communities.\nTourism Malaysia knows this, which is why it worked with us to create a Travel Spotlight landing page. The Spotlight shows travelers how they can experience Malaysian culture by visiting historical sites such as Georgetown, Penang, a UNESCO World Heritage site and home to one of the largest collections of pre-war buildings in Southeast Asia; or by observing a different way of life in Sarawak, which has traditional longhouses housing communities of up to 100 families; or by visiting the indigenous communities of Kadazan and Dusuns, where visitors can shop an array of traditional handicrafts.\nHow your brand can be more inclusive\nWhen traveler shoppers feel understood and embraced, they\u2019re more likely to book. So how can your brand be more inclusive? First, travel marketers can draw from our Inclusion & Diversity in Travel Advertising guidelines, which documents best practices on delivering marketing campaigns that represent and cater to all people."}, {"title": "Inclusive Travel Insights Report", "article": "Signup is easy, free, and gives you exposure to over 675 million monthly site visits.\nIn our last Travel Recovery Trend Report, covering the second quarter of 2021, we highlighted several positive signs for the industry.

From Braille-friendly information centres to barrier-free infrastructures, accessible tourism adds value to travel experiences, enabling people from all walks of life to travel with equity. That vision can be a reality with the help of ISO 21902, which facilitates enjoyment of travel by people of all ages and abilities \u2013 making tourism accessible to everyone.\nA study suggests that accessible tourism is a significant emerging market, expected to generate revenues of EUR 88.6 billion by 2025. The standard helps tourism service providers promote tourist-friendly destinations for the disabled and realize the opportunities this lucrative market has to offer. Whether you are an expectant mom, a senior citizen or a person with a disability, you have the same right as everybody else to enjoy life through barrier-free tourism.

This will help tourists make more informed choices on where to dine and savour the locals\u2019 culinary pride.\nTravelling green\nSustainability will continue to be a priority for hotels in 2022 and beyond, with recent studies suggesting that 76 % of travellers would choose accommodation facilities that have sustainable practices in place.

[ 17 ], accessibility represents a central element of sustainable tourism and simultaneously provides an exceptional business opportunity for tourism facilities, which corresponds to the arguments of Sisto et al. [ 18 ] about accessible tourism representing an emerging segment of tourism demand. With regard to sustainable tourism development, travel for people with disabilities constitutes an opportunity to increase the overall quality of tourist facilities [ 17 ]. Although studies demonstrate the potential of accessible tourism [ 7 13 ], there is a lack of studies focusing on product development for people with disabilities with regard to the sustainable tourism concept. This research therefore relates to the study of accessible tourism product development as a part of sustainable tourism and focuses on the following research question:\nAccessible tourism represents an increasingly relevant segment for tourism development. While the broadly known term \u201cbarrier free tourism\u201d concentrates explicitly on people with disabilities, \u201caccessible tourism\u201d takes all potential visitors of a destination into account [ 8 ]. Accordingly, the concept of accessible tourism pays heed to the \u201cdesign for all\u201d approach, which notes that all user-groups deserve holistic tourism experiences [ 9 10 ]. The tourism industry faces significant challenges related to the implementation of accessible tourism, which leads to continuous critique regarding the omnipresent exclusion of people with disabilities [ 11 12 ]. Moreover, it is argued that the huge potential for accessible tourism is still neglected in the planning and realization process of tourist facilities [ 13 ], although more than 135 million people in Europe live with disabilities [ 14 ] and the number of people at the age of 65 and older is forecast to increase from its current 20% of the population to 30% by the year 2100 [ 15 ]. Thus, referring to the UNWTO [ 16 ], accessible tourism presents an opportunity for destinations and businesses to increase their revenues by attracting new visitors.\nThe tourism industry contributes significantly to the global economy [ 1 ], Europe being the largest tourism continent with approximately 50% of the global overnight stays in 2018 [ 2 ]. Product development in tourism is thus focused on attracting tourists to a destination. Benur and Bramwell [ 3 ] demonstrate in this context that diversified, linked, and intensified products correspond to destinations\u2019 competitiveness and sustainable development. Sustainability in tourism is represented by the sustainable tourism concept, which focuses on meeting \u201cthe needs of present tourists and host regions while protecting and enhancing opportunity for the future.\u201d [ 4 ] (p. 7) Thus, sustainable tourism addresses the balancing of economic, social and environmental tourism impacts by pursuing 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [ 5 ], emphasizing the absence of poverty, as well as empowering less favored groups [ 6 ]. In terms of considering people with disabilities, Darcy et al. [ 7 ] place accessible tourism as a part of the social, environmental, and economic requirements for the implementation of sustainable tourism.\nThus, building on the TBL, this research focuses on product development with objectives of environmental protection, economic prosperity, and social responsibility [ 51 52 ]. According to Mattioda, Fernandes, Detro, Casela and Canciglieri Junior [ 52 ], research on product development in light of the TBL concept is still at an initial stage, making further research necessary. Furthermore, as Haid and Albrecht [ 44 ] recommend studying sustainable tourism product development for particular types of tourist products, this research focuses on products for people with disabilities, in line with the accessible tourism approach.\nFollowing the TBL approach, individual businesses play an important role in the development of sustainable tourism [ 27 ]. Darcy, Cameron and Pegg [ 7 ] linked accessible tourism to the TBL framework by identifying economic, social, and environmental aspects of accessible tourism. In this respect, accessible tourism is based on a set of social networks of destinations rather than individual tourism organizations. Thus, Darcy, Cameron and Pegg [ 7 ] advocate the development of an accessible destination experience to satisfy the tourism market. A key objective of the TBL is that performance is not based solely on shareholder benefits, but rather on the inclusion of all stakeholders, including groups such as community residents [ 26 ]. The central meaning of stakeholder collaboration in project management is emphasized by several authors [ 45 46 ]. Although stakeholder collaboration is considered an important tool to foster the destination image in tourism management in a sustainable manner [ 47 ], this is found to be complex and scarce [ 48 ]. Gillovic and McIntosh [ 10 ] identified a lack of stakeholder collaboration in the development of accessible tourism. In addition, Nyanjom et al. [ 49 ] concluded that there is only minimal collaboration among different stakeholder groups in the development of accessible facilities. However, according to the UNWTO [ 50 ], the cooperation of all public and private stakeholders is required to implement accessibility, placing destinations at the centre of all tourism activities and thus being seen as promoters and disseminators of accessible tourism.\nFor Benur and Bramwell [ 3 ], sustainable development can be supported by developing a mix of tourism products that are mutually beneficial and have collaborative relationships. Thus, profitable products that meet strategic objectives potentially contribute to sustainability [ 3 ]. Following Eckert and Pechlaner [ 43 ], diversification in the form of tourism products is therefore necessary to develop sustainability in tourism. In this regard, a product development approach is targeted to contribute to sustainable tourism. Thus, the coexistence of alternative as well as traditional tourism products is discussed, with a focus on going beyond existing tourism models by focusing on themes and values that characterize a destination. The tourism products help to address destination challenges, for example, by considering the local community as well as dealing with environmental issues [ 43 ], in line with the sustainable tourism concept [ 21 ]. Haid and Albrecht [ 44 ] show that products for sustainable tourism can be developed by adjusting distribution channels and supply chains with the introduction of a sustainability requirement.\nTourism products are developed to meet the needs of potential consumers [ 40 ] and thus attract tourists to destinations [ 3 ]. In this context, tourism products consist of five elements: hospitality, service, inclusion, choice, and physical plant [ 41 ], which are all pull factors aimed at motivating tourists [ 3 ]. Referring to Smith [ 41 ], product development in tourism is characterized by raw inputs being the beginning of generic production, followed by intermediate outputs and inputs leading to tourists\u2019 experiences as final output. Successful integration of the five elements thus leads to the development of a product that is designed to attract tourists\u2019 attention and satisfy their needs [ 40 ]. Following Shuhsien et al. [ 42 ], knowledge about the patterns of consumer demand, consumer preferences, as well as tourism flow is required for strategic tourism product development. Referring to Benur and Bramwell [ 3 ], tourism product linkage, diversification, and intensification are crucial for sustainable development, as well as for destination competitiveness. Thus, tourism products are developed for both mass and niche markets to improve diversification [ 3 ].\nTo foster the development of accessible tourism, different tourism stakeholders need to share similar perceptions on people with disabilities [ 36 ]. In this regard, Oliver [ 31 ] highlights the differentiation between the medical and the social model of disability. The medical approach to disability, which is still predominant in Europe, refers to disability as a result of limited functioning in moving, hearing, seeing, or learning [ 13 31 ]. This is equivalent to a former statement by the WHO [ 37 ] which referred to disabilities as individual problems that trigger obstacles in a natural manner. In contrast to that, the social model of disability refers to disabilities as a result of societal evolution and perceives disability as a social construct that excludes people with disabilities from social participation [ 31 ]. Over the past 40 years, the perspective of the WHO on disabilities has shifted to accord with the social model of disability [ 14 ]. However, to trigger a shift towards the social perspective on disabilities in society, a collective campaign action for change is fundamental [ 38 ]. McIntosh [ 11 ] concludes that such a collective campaign can be achieved by sustainable tourism development for all. According to the UNWTO [ 39 ], the COVID-19 pandemic can serve as a trigger for the development of good accessibility for persons with disabilities to combat the negative effects of the crisis.\nPeople with disabilities in the context of tourism were first reported in relation to the Paralympic games in 1960 [ 29 ]. Twenty years later, Woodside and Etzel [ 30 ] first investigated the travel behavior of people with disabilities. Since then, several concepts for bridging tourism and disability have emerged [ 13 ]. However, the tourism industry is still repeatedly criticized for its exclusive attitude [ 31 ]. This is ascribed to the fact that the requirements and needs of people with disabilities are frequently neglected in the development of tourism products and in the implementation of tourism services [ 12 ]. People with different types and dimensions of disability have in common that their right to social participation is repeatedly unsatisfied [ 32 ]. Different from the broadly known concept of \u201cbarrier free\u201d tourism, accessible tourism includes, in addition to people with disabilities, seniors, families, pregnant women, and people with temporary disabilities [ 13 ]. In this regard, Dickson et al. [ 33 ] conclude that everyone with or without disability will appreciate accessibility once in a lifetime. Moreover, people with disabilities are commonly accompanied by their colleagues or families when travelling and show a high rate of return if destinations fit their accessibility requirements [ 34 ]. Due to demographic changes, there is also an increasing number of seniors travelling, who show, due to retirement, a low seasonal dependency [ 15 35 ]. Thus, accessible tourism development promises a considerable potential.\nSince the inclusion of people with disabilities in the SDGs, the importance of addressing this segment in tourism development has increased [ 28 ]. Following the SDGs, sustainable tourism focuses on the empowerment of disadvantaged groups and the prevention of poverty [ 6 ]. According to Sisto, Cappelletti, Bianchi and Sica [ 18 ], accessible tourism is a key prerequisite for all sustainable tourism strategies and policies. The consideration of people with disabilities is based on socially, economically as well as ecologically sustainable implementation [ 7 ]. Therefore, accessible tourism is an important part of the global sustainable tourism agenda, with accessible tourism being defined as a form of responsible tourism to include people with disabilities [ 17 ]. For the UNWTO [ 16 ], accessibility in tourism must be a central component of all sustainable and responsible tourism policies.\nHowever, Demeritt [ 23 ] criticizes sustainability, claiming that divergent social group interests distract attention from problematic policies by focusing on economic, social, and environmental problems in relation to the SDGs [ 5 ]. Following Higgins-Desbiolles [ 24 ], there is also a discrepancy between tourism and the SDGs, as tourism development is often still based on quantitative growth, such as the goal of increasing the number of overnight stays still being pursued. Accordingly, without considering the environmental and social impacts of tourism, the economic benefits of tourism are considered, and the SDGs are neglected accordingly. Therefore, tourism encounters environmental and social limits but continues to be geared towards growth, which requires comprehensive transformations [ 24 ]. According to Mihalic [ 25 ] sustainable tourism is based on divergent environments that underlie tourism ecology within the tourism system, referring to the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) framework [ 26 ]. The TBL is adopted by tourism organizations in an attempt to incorporate social and environmental sustainable development strategies alongside economic sustainability [ 26 ]. For Dwyer [ 27 ], the TBL provides a decision-making framework in sustainable tourism for both public and private organizations, serving as an external reporting framework and an internal management tool with the aim of achieving sustainable management by integrating social, environmental, and economic considerations into business activities.\nSustainable tourism is widely acknowledged in tourism research and practice, referring to tourism policy, destination management organizations (DMOs), or tourism businesses [ 5 ]. Since its emergence in the 1980s, sustainable tourism has evolved considerably, without, however, detracting from its still considerable relevance [ 19 ]. Sustainable tourism refers to a development [ 20 ] that seeks to protect both tourism communities and tourists while providing opportunities for the future [ 4 ]. In this respect, sustainable tourism builds on the SDGs as introduced by the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development [ 5 ]. The SDGs are focused on economic, environmental, and social impacts in order to reduce global poverty [ 21 ]. Sustainable tourism thus aims to achieve a balance between positive and negative impacts of tourism development, approaching the three pillars of sustainability [ 21 22 ].\nThe data were analyzed following the template analysis approach of King [ 58 ]. In an attempt to pursue a facilitated and systematic data analysis process, MAXQDA was used as qualitative data analysis software. Following the template analysis, the two authors collaboratively developed an initial coding template with a priori themes and a priori codes being defined on the basis of previous studies. In order to enhance the quality of the data analysis, after an evaluation of the interview data, the coding template was revised separately by the researchers. A discussion about parallel findings resulted in a rewording and redefinition of the final coding template. Thus, critical comparison between the two researchers, alongside the independent coding, made it possible to modify the template and thus enhance the overall quality of this research [ 58 59 ]. Additionally, all divergent interviewees\u2019 opinions were incorporated in the data analysis process in order to enhance the objectivity of the research [ 60 ].\nEven though the use of business cases is considered a good tool for raising awareness of the potential of accessible tourism, their application is still underdeveloped [ 7 18 ]. Darcy, Cameron and Pegg [ 7 ] (p. 533) conclude that \u201cuntil examples of good business practice are identified and promoted, the industry cannot be guided with certainty about the benefits in providing expanded accessible tourism products\u201d. Thus, a multiple case study method is adopted, which is particularly useful when developing an understanding of real-life phenomena [ 53 54 ]. In collaboration with organizations for people with disabilities in Italy and Austria, four leisure parks as tourist facilities in Central Europe were selected. The choice was based on three criteria. First, the facilities had to offer products for accessible tourism that were developed in the recent past. Second, facilities that are characterized by nature experiences were regarded. Third, the institutions were proved to have a maximum number of 15 employees. Thus, a purposive sampling technique was applied. For each tourist facility, two representatives involved in the product development process were interviewed, as Haid and Albrecht [ 44 ] recommended including owners or operators in studies on product development for sustainable tourism. The interviews lasted an average of 77 min and were conducted online via Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic and consequent travel restrictions. The interview guideline was developed based on existing research on sustainable tourism [ 19 22 ], accessible tourism [ 7 28 ], and product development [ 3 44 ] literature. In this regard, questions regarding the process of product development, its implementation, and its completion were asked as key themes of the interview guideline. The semi-structured interviews made it possible to delve deeply into the experiences of the interviewees [ 55 ], and the data was triangulated [ 56 ] with publicly available information about the products developed, e.g., from the websites of the tourist facilities. Organization-specific data including the location and size of the organization and the position of the interviewee [ 57 ] (see Table 1 ) was collected by the authors.\n4. Results\n4.1. Values Both the secondary data and the interview analysis reveal that all the tourist facilities researched convey similar core values for their regions. One such major element is nature, which is displayed prominently on all four tourist facilities\u2019 websites. Thus, central to all participants is to provide the best possible nature experience by \u201cbuilding everything on the relation between the person and nature\u201d (TF2_2_10). Similar philosophies can be seen with regard to the consideration of nature in the destinations. Here, the interviewees show that they use nature as a basis on which to build their product developments: \u201cOne thing that we tried was to develop a product, that is to build on the relationship between the park and nature. [\u2026] he felt that the product actually gives him the opportunity to experience this relationship\u201d (TF2_1_23). In addition to that, three of the four regions convey cultural and historical backgrounds: \u201cThe most important requirement was that it should be an immersive experience of the World Heritage Site [\u2026] and bring added value. That was the initial situation\u201d (TF1_1_3). Finally, the analysis of the websites results in the conclusion that leisure is the central anchor of all these tourist facilities. Thus, they display leisure activities for both guests and residents. In the course of the respective product developments, the participating regions\u2019 values, namely, nature, culture, and leisure experiences, were to be made available to people with disabilities. However, the developments at the tourist facilities were not meant to be supportive solely of people with disabilities but were also for people without disabilities. \u201cIn this respect, it is a technology or an application that brings something to all visitors and has been developed on a broad basis.\u201d (TF1_2_3). Furthermore, according to the interviewees, value should be created in terms of opportunities and alternatives, as this quote shows: \u201cWe don\u2019t just want to make something that is useful for people or visitors with a walking disability, but it is important to us that this visitor platform at the top is an added value for days when it rains, or out of season\u2014when there is perhaps a winter closure, where it is too icy or too slippery to enter the gorge\u201d (TF1_1_3). Retrospectively, the lessons learned from working on the inclusion of people with disabilities are twofold. While the tourist facilities mainly stated that they would realize the product development in a similar manner again, there are still some issues related to that. To increase the sustainability of the implementation process, suppliers would have needed to receive a deeper briefing on the core themes of the respective facilities and destinations. Such takeaways made participants conclude that \u201c[\u2026] if I had to make another trail of perception now, I would be less clueless. So, I would have already a method because as we showed during our presentation, now we have kind of a model\u201d (TF3_2_24).\n4.2. Product Development For product development, the interviewees indicated that they tried to make the best use of the manifold potential of information provision for everyone: \u201cWe wanted to offer this new opportunity with all the physical and also technological tools and instruments to facilitate\u2014not just facilitate, also give this experience a natural flavor\u201d (TF3_1_1). Thus, interviewees indicated that inclusion of people with disabilities took a central role throughout the product development: \u201c[\u2026] the focus was inclusive communication as a way to involve those who are sometimes neglected or are not taken into consideration when developing this kind of product, which means especially that deaf people or people with visual impairments, but also pregnant mothers, children, as well as old people are to be regarded\u201d (TF2_1_9). The applications were planned in a way that should enhance the ability of people with disabilities to experience the facilities and regions on their own. \u201cActually, the trail of perceptions in some segments of the trail allows the visually impaired people and also people in wheelchairs to have the experience all alone. So, this is another very important aspect which is very positive for people with disabilities\u201d (TF3_1_3). Throughout the product\u2019s development, feedback from the target groups was described as essential: \u201cThe two visually impaired ladies told us that there might be some points\u2014where there is water, that could be a little bit difficult. But if you have someone who will show you where to put your feet, it is no problem\u201d (TF3_1_3). In addition, feedback from H&T service providers as promoters of the product was requested in the way that \u201cwe have sent it to 31 hotels of medium and large size. [\u2026] We asked all of them for some feedback where the managers were asked to describe if it fits their requirements or not\u201d (TF4_1_17). To reach the best possible outcome, the feedback was taken into consideration and brought up the relevant consequences regarding further development. For instance, infographics were adjusted, special virtual reality effects were reduced, the web app was enhanced with new features, and the contrast level in illustrations was adapted. These improvements, however, did not always work out as expected beforehand and led to several drawbacks for the parties responsible. One such was caused by bureaucracy, e.g., \u201cWe may have 8 different info-panels in 8 municipalities, and I have to get the permission of 8 different municipalities before I install a sign anywhere\u201d (TF1_2_29). In terms of the product development phase, the most important lesson learnt at the four tourist facilities is aimed at stakeholder collaboration: \u201cThey were working together, and they were not just working on it in an isolated way. So, they were not just working on this and that. They were all working together, updating each other\u201d (TF2_2_38). Accordingly, the fusion of different interests is described as an essential tool for fostering a sustainable product development. To avoid conflicts between the parties involved, clarity of roles is of vital importance. In particular, the development of accessible implementations is characterized as a \u201cmultidisciplinary system of work, which brings together different competences, such as narratives, as well as IT and accessibility experts\u201d (TF2_2_38). On the one hand, it is important to \u201c[\u2026] have suppliers that are aware that they are doing something for a particular target group\u201d (TF3_2_22). On the other hand, there are stakeholder groups that are in a position to put greater pressure on accessible tourism development than others, as this quote shows: \u201cWe do not have a mandate. There must be entities that have a mandate involved [\u2026] for example representatives of people with disabilities or organizations for people with disabilities\u201d (TF4_2_86). In addition to the involvement of stakeholder groups, such as H&T service providers, volunteers, municipalities, and suppliers, the continuous involvement of the target groups is fundamental in order to take account of all the potential requirements of people with disabilities throughout the development process: \u201cThe main aspect is to involve the specific target group that you are working for, because they can, in certain cases, change a lot the perspective that you have and that you think is the right one. And so, they can help you to avoid making big mistakes that maybe cannot be solved, if you do not involve them from the beginning\u201d (TF3_2_22). COVID-19 had several impacts on the product development process for the tourist facilities: \u201cDuring coronavirus, we had some delays, some significant delays due to the fact that suppliers were not able to work, or they were supplied or expecting supplies of goods from different countries with border problems\u201d (TF2_2_50). To catch up again, \u201cwe asked to prolong the end of the project. But the lead partner informed us that it was not possible\u201d (TF3_2_28). In addition to that, the pandemic situation led to limited financial resources, which forced the tourist facilities to concentrate on their core competences and required that \u201c[\u2026] the visitor survey be in some way suspended or executed in a reduced form this year\u201d (TF1_1_76). In addition to issues related to the pandemic situations, limited resources were also mentioned: \u201cThere you can insert many new trails and provide even more detailed descriptions. However, this would have required much more effort which we were not able to afford\u201d (TF4_1_4)."}, {"title": "A Guide on Barrier-free Travel", "article": "In January 2020, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) and Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU) jointly organized the Barrier-Free Discover Tour in Taipei.

So, be sure to check with the airline before booking your ticket. With the proper preparation and communication with the airline, individuals with disabilities can have a safe and enjoyable flying experience in Taiwan.\nCultural Considerations\nOne must be mindful of cultural differences and customs when traveling in Taiwan to ensure a respectful and enjoyable experience. Taiwan is a country deeply rooted in tradition and etiquette, and as a visitor, it\u2019s important to be aware of these customs.\nFor example, it\u2019s customary to remove your shoes when entering someone\u2019s home or certain establishments, such as temples. Additionally, it\u2019s considered impolite to point with your finger, so it\u2019s recommended to use an open hand or nod in the direction you are indicating.\nAnother important cultural consideration is the concept of \u2018face\u2019 in Taiwan. This refers to the need to maintain a positive social image and avoid causing embarrassment or shame to oneself or others.\nAs a traveler, it\u2019s important to be respectful and avoid any behavior that may be perceived as confrontational or disrespectful. This could include speaking loudly in public, ignoring local customs, or being overly critical or negative in your interactions with others.\nBy being mindful of these cultural differences and customs, you can have a more enjoyable and respectful experience while navigating Taiwan\u2019s transportation system with a disability.\nResources for Travelers with Disabilities\nYou\u2019ll be relieved to know that there are resources available to help you plan your trip and ensure a smooth and comfortable journey as a traveler with disabilities in Taiwan.\nThe Taiwan Tourism Bureau has a website dedicated to accessible travel information, which includes a list of accessible tourist attractions, accommodations, and transportation options.

From minor annoyances to violent crimes, getting from point A to B can be fraught with risk.\nGoal 11 of the United Nations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sustainable development goals exhorts member states to provide safe, affordable, and accessible transportation for everyone, especially those who find themselves in vulnerable situations. And yet, while disparate initiatives have been launched around the world to make public commutes safer and accessible for everyone, a survey of the United Nations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and other international agencies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 research, plus our own analysis, suggests there is still more to be done across the three main stages of the commuter journey: planning and booking, the predeparture experience at boarding areas, and the travel itself.\nIn this article, we consider just how inclusive global public-transit systems are and explore ways that municipalities, urban planners, and other key stakeholders can assess and accommodate the end-to-end needs of all travelers.\nHow inclusive are our public-transit systems?\nOver the past decade, international organizations such as the United Nations have made the concerted effort to study inclusivity in urban-transport systems as a means to guarantee fair opportunities for all commuters. The insights that have come out of this endeavor fall under two broad themes.\nFirst, a collection of studies\u00e2\u0080\u0094including the UN Commission on the Status of Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Safe cities and safe public spaces for women and girls study\u00e2\u0080\u0094provide analyses of the key safety and communications issues that public-transport operators need to address. These include reducing violence and harassment on public transit, ensuring safer nighttime commutes, and providing clear, effective, around-the-clock communication between operators and travelers.\nSecond, a separate stream of research studies the main barriers that limit inclusion on public transit for women, people with disabilities, and low-income travelers, among others. Critical obstacles include, among others, poorly designed transportation, high ticket prices, inadequate safety regulations, and schedules that fail to account for the travel patterns of commuters with specific needs.\nAs they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve become aware of these issues and limitations, many public-transit system providers and urban planners have launched initiatives to address them\u00e2\u0080\u0094to limited effect, however. Such campaigns and programs have typically been introduced in an ad hoc manner rather than integrated into the overall public-transport system.\nSome cities, such as Los Angeles and Santiago, focused on surveying travel patterns of public-transit users, while others, including a major European capital and a large city in Southeast Asia, mostly worked on communication campaigns to raise awareness of nighttime safety. Other cities\u00e2\u0080\u0099 efforts were limited in scope. In Madrid, for example, on-demand bus stops were introduced on suburban routes during specific times to reduce the walking distance home for female passengers.\nFrom booking to travel: An end-to-end approach to inclusion\nShare From the inside out: Inclusion in the urban-transport workforce According to the latest Kantar Inclusion Index, less than half of transportation employees believe that their organizations are actively pursuing inclusion. In addition, the sector reports above-average workplace bullying/harassment and situations in which employees were made to feel uncomfortable. Fostering greater inclusion for public-transport employees requires providers to start with an accurate assessment of where they stand. Then, they can begin embarking on diversity, equity, and inclusion\u00c2 (DEI) transformation journeys to reshape their way of working. Diversity refers to workforce composition across various identity-related characteristics, such as gender, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, and disabilities. Equity focuses on ensuring that identity is not predictive of opportunities or workplace outcomes. Inclusion refers to the degree to which an individual feels that they can bring their authentic selves to work, enabling them to contribute in a meaningful and deliberate manner. From our experience working in this space, public-transport providers can gain DEI awareness in different ways. Sometimes targeted, eye-opening workshops aimed at uncovering deeply rooted unconscious bias represent a wake-up call for organizations: having diverse subsets of colleagues collaborate to identify unexpected biases in their ways of thinking is sometimes sufficient to trigger top-management engagement toward a new way of working. In other cases, transport agencies go even further and fully train their staff on civil-rights issues, among others, and on potential biases toward underrepresented categories. In other cases, achieving a profound understanding of the internal level of inclusivity can require more time and various sessions at all levels of the organization. Once companies agree that room for improvement exists, the journey to a fully inclusive work environment unfolds. After the first step of assessing and building the fact base through company-specific business cases, other challenging steps of the process remain: Architect (development of key performance indicators and road map): beginning with a solid awareness and understanding of the internal level of inclusion, companies develop a plan by designing a portfolio of initiatives linked to specific and tangible objectives, prioritizing them on feasibility and expected impact. The initiatives plan is complemented by the identification of pilots to be launched and tested, either on selected perimeters or on a company-wide basis.\nAct (test and learn with quick programs): companies start launching pilots and initiatives on target business units, functions, and geographies, in line with the agreed-upon implementation plan. As the plan unfolds, insights from pilots can be used to learn and refine ongoing and future initiatives.\nAdvance (build on success and track progress): in the core phase of the implementation, companies get the program to full scale. This requires a strong monitoring and accountability structure, alongside a proven knowledge codification and sharing system to constantly improve idea generation and the implementation of initiatives. Among public-transportation providers, one of the most notable programs in the past few years was launched by the roads and transport authority in a major city in the Middle East, which focused on including and elevating women\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, it created a dedicated fund for high-performing women employees and another initiative for \u00e2\u0080\u009cpeople of determination,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which included ad hoc employment and training programs.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time for urban-transport providers to draw from our collective understanding of inclusion and design and implement an urban-transport system that works for everyone. While this article focuses on the customer journey, travel providers should not miss the opportunity to transform their own organizations as well (see sidebar, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom the inside out: Inclusion in the urban-transport workforce\u00e2\u0080\u009d).\nTo further contribute to our existing understanding of travel and inclusion, we conducted our own research. We surveyed more than 20 different public-transport operators around the world and identified key requirements and initiatives for an inclusive public-transport system. We found that while there are many initiatives to enhance inclusion, they are typically not part of an integrated, 360-degree framework. We believe that a comprehensive and integrated approach to inclusive transportation comprises initiatives that fall into six categories (Exhibit 1).\n1\nWe mapped these requirements and initiatives along the commuter journey, which we broke down into three parts: the booking stage, the predeparture stage, and the actual travel experience (Exhibit 2). In each phase, there are actions travel providers can take to address specific pain points. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll explore those actions using the example of a rail-based journey\u00e2\u0080\u0094although the conceptual principles here can be applied to other forms of urban transport, such as buses and ferries.\n2\nThe booking stage\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s common nowadays for people to use navigation apps to find the most convenient route to their destination. The would-be passenger decides on the starting and arrival points, preferred mode of transport, and time of travel. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll factor in potential route disruptions (and explore alternatives, if necessary), how crowded the commute might be, and whether there are any loyalty-program benefits to be accrued.\nThis stage presents a number of potential pain points for some commuters. For instance, a wheelchair user may not know if a train station is equipped with elevators and if there are design barriers that may make it difficult to board and alight from a train.\nSome cities have tried to create a more accessible and safe experience for senior travelers. For instance, Salzburg has launched initiatives to promote the use of public transport among older people. The city has hosted \u00e2\u0080\u009cmobility days,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and pamphlets on commuter safety can be found in all train stations. Salzburg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bus drivers are also trained to be extra vigilant around older passengers, and vehicles are designed with senior citizens in mind. These initiatives have reduced accidents among older people and increased awareness among the remaining population.\nOur research points to a number of actions urban-transport providers can take at the booking and planning stage to create more inclusion. For instance, they could create pooling options in their travel apps so that passengers could choose to commute in groups. They may offer special rates at this stage as well, to disabuse people of the idea that accessible travel options are more expensive than standard ones. Passengers could also be given the option to easily share their itinerary with their friends and loved ones for an additional layer of oversight.\nTravel providers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 mobile apps may also provide a direct line of communication between the traveler and the provider and are a tool providers may want to use more strategically. Safety issues could be flagged immediately. Information about security measures, optimal travel times, and easy-access facilities could be relayed through this channel when passengers check and confirm their itinerary. The Transport for London, for instance, allows for just this with its dedicated journey planner; the app lets would-be passengers optimize their journey from the booking stage.\nPredeparture phase\nArriving at a station or terminal can be an overwhelming experience, with hordes of people crisscrossing in every possible direction\u00e2\u0080\u0094businesspeople rushing to catch their trains with barely minutes to spare, families trying to herd rowdy children toward the right platform, and buskers plying their craft.\nFor many, the predeparture phase looks like this: you receive a push notification from your travel provider with information about your train\u00e2\u0080\u0099s departure time. To get to the platform you go through a thermal-imaging scanner that checks your temperature, you make it past the turnstile with an electronic ticket, and you find the correct platform, where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll wait to board.\nFor groups or travelers with specific logistical needs, this phase can be full of hazards. If they are early for their train, for instance, such passengers may find few accessible waiting spaces to accommodate them.\nThere are a number of ways urban-travel providers can improve the predeparture experience for all travelers. They may want to integrate important safety and pooling information into the departure reminder, noting the location of accessible facilities and safe train cars\u00e2\u0080\u0094carriages with an attendant, conductor, or security officer. Visual \u00e2\u0080\u009cnudges\u00e2\u0080\u009d and cues could promote positive behaviors, such as offering assistance to people with mobility constraints or to pregnant women. In stations where longer wait times are common, more rooms for nursing mothers and a greater number of dedicated waiting areas could be created. Treating the station as a civic space by promoting community-focused activities\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as increasing retail outlets and installing open pianos\u00e2\u0080\u0094could also enhance commuters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sense of safety.\nIn 2006, the city of Graz, Austria, upgraded its key stops to make them both more accessible and livable; and, targeting both safety and comfort in its train platforms and stations, the Canadian cities of Ottawa and Toronto created designated Transecure waiting areas.\nTraveling and arriving at the destination\nThere are a number of actions travel providers can take to make passengers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 journeys inclusive once they are on board. For instance, it is possible for travelers on most trains to track their progress while en route\u00e2\u0080\u0094but it may not always be clear how to request help in cases of violence of harassment. Particularly when it comes to late-night routes, passengers may be in near-empty train cars. To provide peace of mind for all passengers, urban-travel planners should install highly visible GPS panic buttons throughout the system, as they have in New Delhi and Bangalore.\nCommuters with specific needs could be directed to the train\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safe wagons with security personnel and closer supervision. Pregnant women or passengers with specific physical needs could wear \u00e2\u0080\u009cMay I sit\u00e2\u0080\u009d pins to alert other commuters to give way to them. Travel providers could also make it easier for these commuters to find information about connections and the safest ways to get to the next boarding point.\nWhile our case study focuses on rail travel, alternative transport modes may offer other opportunities for greater inclusion. The flexibility afforded by bus travel presents more options for making the travel experience safer. Passengers could be allowed to alight, on request, at specific time slots, for example, from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m., to reduce the distance between the drop-off point to the final destination. This is exactly what the city of Madrid put in place, arranging on-demand night bus stops on interurban bus lines.\nCreating an inclusive urban-transport system doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop the moment a passenger gets off the train. Transport providers could review the arrival experiences and partner with security companies to provide additional support or with taxi and rideshare companies to provide special rates for arriving passengers.\nSetting the goal of an entirely accessible public-transport system is becoming increasingly common in major cities worldwide. Barcelona has committed to a 100 percent accessible underground metro system by 2024, and Seattle is already fully wheelchair accessible.\nOther municipalities and travel providers can do the same by undertaking a thorough assessment of customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 needs along the whole journey, mapping the potential pain points, and implementing targeted initiatives to address them. Of course, this process is an iterative one; any initiatives launched should be evaluated and refined over time. The systemic, end-to-end approach outlined in this article should help make traveling in our cities truly safer for all."}, {"title": null, "article": null}, {"title": "Wheelchair Accessible Transportation Options When Traveling", "article": "For wheelchair users, accessible transportation can become a fundamental consideration when planning a trip.

While some destinations may not provide many accessible rental vehicles or ride-shares, others offer exceptional wheelchair accessible public transportation, which may be the best option for traveling within the city. Places like San Fransisco, New York, and Europe as a whole have excellent public transportation. In either case, it is important to research as much as you can so you\u2019re well prepared and know what to expect.\nConnecting with other travelers can be a great resource for preparing for your trip. Ask questions, share your experiences, and connect with like-minded travelers in our Facebook group Wheel the World - Accessible Travel Community.\nWheelchair Accessible Vehicles (WAVs) \u267f\nWhat is a Wheelchair Accessible Vehicle(WAVs) and what does it mean? WAVs are specially designed (or adapted) vehicles of any kind that allows wheelchair users to enter and exit the vehicle with ease. These vehicles have lowered floors and a ramp or lift that allows the wheelchair to be rolled into the vehicle. The interior is designed to accommodate the wheelchair user, with features such as wheelchair tie-downs and accessible controls that allow the user to travel in their wheelchair safely. Some WAVs are also equipped with features such as hand controls for driving, power lifts, and transfer seats to make the transportation experience even more comfortable and convenient for the user.\nAccessible ramps into van.\nWheelchair Accessible Rental Van Services\nFor those who require more specialized transportation, accessible vans can be a great option. These vehicles are designed specifically to accommodate wheelchair users, with features such as wheelchair lifts and tie-downs. Accessible vans can be scheduled through phone or email.\nAt Wheel the World we work with several wheelchair accessible van providers in various destinations around the world, such as Morocco, Chile, Mexico, Costa Rica, France, Spain, Israel, and Qatar, to name a few.\n\u267f Need help with transportation, van rental, and/or insurance for your trip? Request a quote , hear back in less than one business day.\nWAV Options at Ride-Sharing Services\nRide-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft provide accessibility through their WAV option. Typically, the vehicles are minivans or something similar, and the rates are usually the same as a standard UberX. Keep in mind that these aren\u2019t available in every city, so if you\u2019re considering using ride-sharing on your trip, make sure you research to see if it\u2019s a viable option at your destination. At this time, some of the current cities where WAV is offered and has solid availability:\nNew York\nSan Francisco\nPortland\nBoston\nSeattle\nToronto\nWheelchair accessible transportation in Costa Rica\nAccessible Public Transportation\nMany public transportation systems offer wheelchair accessible options, such as buses and trains, while others offer paratransit services for those who are unable to use traditional public transportation. It is important to plan ahead and research the accessibility options in your area because not all public transportation systems are fully accessible.\nIn the U.S, public transportation is not accessible in every destination:\nBus transportation is accessible in almost every city, but can be very ineffective due to the lack of coverage in many cases. Research the bus routes at your destination and see if it would be a good option for you.\nThe San Francisco BART is almost 100% accessible. Every station has elevators, and although they are not very clean, it covers a majority of the city.\nOutside of the U.S there are many cities that we have identified with good public transportation. A few examples are:\nBarcelona, Spain - Great train and bus systems that are fully accessible.\nLondon, England - The buses have great accessibility and the Underground has a number of accessible stations, especially the ones around downtown.\nBerlin, Germany - Most subway stations are accessible.\nSantiago, Chile - The majority of subway stations and buses are accessible. Staying in the Vitacura/Providencia area of the city will allow you to use the subway and buses and go around accessible areas of the city.\nWheelchair lift into public transportation (bus)\nWheelchair Accessible Dispatch Taxis\nWheelchair-accessible dispatch taxi services are another great option for those who require specialized transportation. These services allow users to schedule a ride in an accessible taxi that has been designed to accommodate wheelchair users. These services can be scheduled in advance, allowing you to plan you transportation needs more conveniently. However, it's important to keep in mind that not every destination may offer these services, so it's important to research your options in advance.\nConclusion\nAlthough finding accessible transportation can be a challenge, there are several options available to wheelchair users. By exploring these alternatives, you can find the transportation option that works best for your needs and helps you maintain your independence and mobility.

Check with your airline for more information. Airlines are required to provide people with disabilities access to the aircraft, an aisle seat, and a seat with a removable armrest.\nIf you plan to fly within a foreign country or between countries while abroad, the regulations above might not apply. Check with the airline to find out what accommodations it makes for people with disabilities.\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation has a toll-free hotline, 800-778-4838 (voice) or 800-455-9880 (TTY), for more information about the rights of air travelers with disabilities. Also, check federal relay 711 or the Transportation Security Administration\u2019s website for answers to questions about screening policies, procedures, and checkpoints. Find out if there are specific policies for devices such as wheelchairs, portable machines, batteries, respirators, and oxygen.\nConsiderations for Cruise Ship Travel\nMost cruise ships can accommodate travelers with disabilities. Check with the cruise line before booking to make sure any accommodations you\u2019ll need are available, such as medical oxygen or a wheelchair. Some cruises cater to travelers with special needs, such as patients on dialysis.\nTraveling with Service Animals\nMost airlines allow a trained service animal to accompany a qualified individual with a disability. Be sure to check with your airline to ensure that your service animal meets the airline\u2019s requirements, including necessary documentation. Service animals may not be allowed to enter all countries and are subject to animal importation regulations, such as quarantine regulations. Your service animal will also be subject to US animal import regulations when flying to the United States.

If you need medical care abroad, see Getting Health Care During Travel.\nMore Information"}, {"title": "Travelers with Disabilities", "article": "Air Travel Regulations & Standards\nAir Carrier Access Act\nIn 1986, Congress passed the Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA) to ensure that people with disabilities are treated without discrimination in a way consistent with the safe carriage of all air passengers. These regulations were established by the US Department of Transportation (DOT) and apply to all flights provided by US airlines and flights to or from the United States by foreign carriers.\nACAA ensures carriers cannot refuse transportation based on a disability. The ACAA has a few exceptions, however; for example, the carrier can refuse transportation if the person with a disability would endanger the health or safety of other passengers or if transporting the person would be a violation of Federal Aviation Administration safety rules. Travelers and their clinicians can learn more about exceptions and other aspects of the ACAA by reviewing What Airline Employees, Airline Contractors, and Air Travelers with Disabilities Need to Know about Access to Air Travel for Persons with Disabilities (see Table 3-05 for link). Air carriers are also obliged to accept a declaration by travelers with disabilities that they are self-reliant. A medical certificate (a written statement from the traveler\u2019s health care provider saying that the traveler can complete the flight safely without requiring extraordinary medical care or endangering other travelers) might be required in specific situations. Examples of specific situations include a person intending to travel with a possible communicable disease, a person requiring a stretcher or oxygen, or a person whose medical condition can be reasonably expected to affect the operation of the flight. Under the guidelines of the ACAA, when a traveler with disability requests assistance, the airline is obliged to meet certain accessibility requirements. For example, carriers must provide access to the aircraft door (preferably by a level entry bridge), an aisle seat, and a seat with removable armrests. However, aircraft with <30 seats generally are exempt from these requirements. Any aircraft with >60 seats must have an onboard wheelchair, and personnel must help move the onboard wheelchair from a seat to the lavatory area upon request. Only wide-body aircraft with \u22652 aisles are required to have fully accessible lavatories.\nAirline personnel are not required to assist with feeding, visiting the lavatory, or dispensing medication to travelers. Travelers with disabilities who require this type of assistance should travel with a companion or attendant. DOT maintains a toll-free hotline (800-778-4838 [voice] or 800-455-9880 [TTY]), available 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday\u2013Friday, except federal holidays, to provide general information to consumers about the rights of air travelers with disabilities and to assist air travelers with time-sensitive disability-related issues.\nMany non\u2013US airlines voluntarily adhere to codes of practice that are similar to US legislation based on guidelines from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO; see Table 3-05). These guidelines are not identical to those outlined in US legislation, however, and the degree of implementation can vary by airline and location. Travelers planning to fly between foreign countries or within a foreign country while abroad should check with the overseas airlines to ensure that the carriers adhere to accessibility standards adequate for their needs. ICAO (see Table 3-05) also provides accessibility scores for airports across the world that can aid in travel planning.\nAssistive Devices\nAssistive devices can make traveling more accessible for people with disabilities. Travelers and their health care providers can consult the DOT and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) websites (see Table 3-05) for information on traveling with an assistive device. Travelers should check for specific policies for assistive devices, including wheelchairs, portable machines, batteries, respirators, and portable oxygen concentrators.\nIn-Flight Services\nAirlines are not permitted to require travelers to provide advance notice of a disability. Airlines might require up to 48 hours advance notice and 1-hour advance check-in, however, for certain accommodations that require preparation time for services (if they are available on the flight), such as medical oxygen for use on board the aircraft, carriage of an incubator, hook-up for a respirator to the aircraft electrical power supply, accommodation for a passenger who must travel in a stretcher, transport of a battery-powered wheelchair on an aircraft with <60 seats, provision by the airline of hazardous material packaging for batteries used in wheelchairs or other assistive devices, accommodation for \u226510 people with disabilities who travel as a group, or provision of an onboard wheelchair for use on an aircraft that does not have an accessible lavatory.\nAll audiovisual displays played on aircraft for safety and informational purposes must use captioning or a sign language interpreter as part of the video presentation. The captioning must be in the predominant languages in which the carrier communicates with passengers on the flight. The current ACAA rule does not require the captioning of in-flight entertainment.\nAirport Accommodations\nSecurity Screening\nThe TSA has established a program for screening travelers with disabilities and their equipment, mobility aids, and devices. TSA permits prescription liquid medications and other liquids needed by people with disabilities and medical conditions. Travelers with disabilities or medical conditions that affect TSA screening might use a TSA Notification Card to communicate with screening officers; they can also learn more about TSA guidelines for disabilities and medical conditions online (see Table 3-05).\nAs with other people with disabilities or medical conditions, travelers with hearing loss (i.e., individuals who are deaf or who are hard of hearing) can provide the TSA officer with a notification card or other medical documentation that describes their condition and informs the officer about the need for assistance with the screening process. Travelers are not required to remove any hearing aids or external cochlear implant devices. Additional screening, including a pat-down or device inspection, might be required if assistive devices alarm security technology.\nTravelers with disabilities or medical conditions can call the TSA helpline toll free at 855-787-2227, federal relay 711, or check TSA's website for answers to questions about screening policies, procedures, and the security checkpoints.\nClosed Captioning\nAs part of the ACAA, DOT rules require any airport terminal facility that receives federal financial assistance to enable or ensure high-contrast captioning at all times on televisions and other audiovisual displays. Captioning is required on televisions and other audiovisual displays located in any common area of the terminal to which passengers have access, including the gate area, ticketing area, passenger lounges, and leased commercial shop and restaurant spaces.\nTelecommunication Devices\nCurrent ACAA rules require people with hearing loss to self-identify to airline carrier personnel to ensure their receipt of accessible information. Passenger information, including information about flight schedule changes, connections, gate assignments, and baggage claim must be transmitted in a timely manner through an accessible method of communication to those who have identified themselves as having hearing loss.\nPassengers with hearing loss must identify themselves to carrier personnel at the gate area or the customer service desk even if they have already done so at the ticketing area. The ACAA rules do not require a sign language interpreter to ensure that a passenger with hearing loss receives all pertinent information. If an airline carrier provides telephone reservation and information service to the public, these services must be available to people with hearing loss through a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD), telecommunications relay services, or other technology.\nWheelchairs\nTravelers can decide to rent wheelchairs and medical equipment at their destination. Research on renting wheelchairs might include checking the availability of wheelchair and medical equipment providers. In addition, organizations such as Mobility International USA have information about overseas medical equipment providers. The country voltage, type of electrical plug, and reliability of the electrical infrastructure at the destination country might make one type of wheelchair preferable over another. In some cases, a manual instead of a power wheelchair is the preferred assistive device.\nBoarding & Deplaning with a Wheelchair\nSmaller airplanes might not have a jetway, and travelers who use wheelchairs might need to be manually lifted or carried down the stairs. Some airports have adapted hoists or lifts. An aisle chair is usually required to board and deplane an airplane. Travelers should be sure to mention they need an aisle chair, both when reserving tickets and when checking in at the airport. Additional wheelchair traveling tips are available through Wheelchair Travel\u2019s Wheelchair Users\u2019 Guide to Air Travel.\nService Animals\nSome travelers require a service animal for travel support. Travelers who require service animals, including emotional support animals, should check with the airline and the destination country to ensure that both will permit the animal and that the traveler obtains all required documentation (see Sec. 7, Ch. 6, Traveling with Pets & Service Animals). Clinicians can use the following recommendations to assist travelers with service animals. Travelers can contact the foreign embassy or consulate of the destination country for information on possible restrictions and cultural norms about service animals. Travelers should find out about any required quarantine, vaccination, and documentation for the service animal; consult their veterinarian for tips about traveling with service animals; and contact destination hotels to make certain they will accommodate service animals.\nCruise Ships\nCompanies or entities conducting programs or tours on cruise ships that dock at US ports have obligations regarding access for travelers with disabilities, even if the ship itself is of foreign registry, as outlined in Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act. All travelers with disabilities should check with cruise lines regarding availability of requested or needed items before booking. Cruise ship operators and travel agents that cater to travelers with special needs also exist.\nMedical Considerations\nSome travelers can have both a disability and an underlying health condition. Box 3-02 provides a list of suggestions the travel health provider can use to help the traveler plan to manage their condition while abroad. For more details, refer to Sec. 3, Ch. 3, Travelers with Chronic Illnesses."}, {"title": "A to Z of Disabilities and Accommodations", "article": "JAN provides the following A to Z listings by disability, topic, and limitation.

These modifications enable an individual with a disability to have an equal opportunity not only to get a job, but successfully perform their job tasks to the same extent as people without disabilities. The ADA requires reasonable accommodations as they relate to three aspects of employment: 1) ensuring equal opportunity in the application process; 2) enabling a qualified individual with a disability to perform the essential functions of a job; and 3) making it possible for an employee with a disability to enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment.\nAccommodations are sometimes referred to as \u201cproductivity enhancers\u201d. Reasonable accommodations should not be viewed as \u201cspecial treatment\u201d and they often benefit all employees. For example, facility enhancements such as ramps, accessible restrooms, and ergonomic workstations benefit more than just employees with disabilities. Examples of reasonable accommodations include making existing facilities accessible; job restructuring; part-time or modified work schedules; acquiring or modifying equipment; changing tests, training materials, or policies; and providing qualified readers or interpreters. Here are some more examples. Many job accommodations cost very little and often involve minor changes to a work environment, schedule or work-related technologies:\nPhysical changes Installing a ramp or modifying a rest room Modifying the layout of a workspace\nAccessible and assistive technologies Ensuring computer software is accessible Providing screen reader software Using videophones to facilitate communications with colleagues who are deaf\nAccessible communications Providing sign language interpreters or closed captioning at meetings and events Making materials available in Braille or large print\nPolicy enhancements Modifying a policy to allow a service animal in a business setting Adjusting work schedules so employees with chronic medical conditions can go to medical appointments and complete their work at alternate times or locations\nThese are just a few example.

In disability employment antidiscrimination law and policy, perhaps the most important driver of the inclusion command is the \u201caccommodation principle,\u201d which requires that employers make reasonable adjustments to tasks and places of work to enable full and equal participation by qualified individuals with disabilities [2].\nIn the seminal 2004 U.S. Supreme Court case Tennessee v. Lane [3], the late Justice Ruth Ginsburg wrote of the centrality of the ADA\u2019s accommodation principle:\nIncluding individuals with disabilities among people who count in composing \u201cWe the People,\u201d Congress understood in shaping the ADA, would sometimes require not blindfolded equality, but responsiveness to difference; not indifference, but accommodation. Central to the Act\u2019s primary objective, Congress extended the statute\u2019s range to reach all government activities, [], and required \u2026 \u201creasonable accommodations.\u201d\nUnder the ADA, the word \u201cdiscriminate\u201d consequently includes failure to make reasonable accommodations to the physical and mental limitations of a qualified individual with a disability, in the absence of an \u201cundue hardship\u201d on the business [1]. Discrimination includes denying opportunities to a job applicant or employee if such denial is based on the need for the entity to make reasonable accommodations to that person\u2019s physical or mental conditions [1]. By directing employers to accept responsibility, within reason, for accommodations (up to the undue hardship ceiling), the ADA\u2019s Title I sets the ADA apart from other U.S. civil rights legislation.\nThe importance of the accommodation principle to disability inclusive employment law and policy is manifest [4]. The goal of offering equal employment opportunity to everyone, regardless of disability, is meaningless if the new hire uses a wheelchair and the sole entrance to the workplace is up a flight of stairs. The right to work rings hollow if people who are deaf or hard of hearing, who are blind or have low vision, or who have reading or cognitive disabilities cannot use or access a company\u2019s web-based technologies [5]. Opportunity is foreclosed when an employer will not alter work schedules within reason, or bars telework or remote work, without consideration for qualified individuals with episodic or mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety, that require flexibility [6].\nTitle I of the ADA defines the accommodation principle to include, within reason, making facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, as well as job restructuring, part-time and modified work schedules, remote work and telecommuting, modification of equipment and devices, and other effective means of enabling qualified individuals with disabilities to perform essential functions of their jobs, whether traditional or non-traditional [1]. The ADA gives substantial weight to an employer\u2019s definition of \u201cessential\u201d job functions and the extent to which such tasks may be done effectively with accommodation.\nResearch shows the low costs and the numerous benefits of the accommodation principle. Most workplace accommodations incur de minimis or near-zero costs [7,8,9,10]. Employers in most cases can accommodate people with disabilities with relative ease, formally or informally. Further, there are far-reaching, positive ripple effects from a \u201cculture of accommodation\u201d for all [11, 12]. At the organizational level, accommodations improve employee productivity, morale, and tenure. If an organization promotes a \u201cculture of inclusion,\u201d a climate of flexible and supportive approaches, it furthers effective and innovative accommodations and productive outcomes for all employees and for itself [9, 10, 13,14,15], and it enjoys the benefits of attracting and retaining qualified workers [13]. The ripple effect extends even further: promoting economic opportunity for people with disabilities produces a corresponding decrease in their need for federal disability insurance and other governmental support funding, along with a resultant increase in tax revenues.\nThe research thus suggests the value, to all of society, of documenting, devising, and promoting strategies to increase awareness and implementation of the accommodation principle across organizations of different sizes and types, and across market and labor sectors.\nAt the thirtieth anniversary of the ADA, the articles in this special topic section consider, variously, the future of disability-inclusive employment in light of how the accommodation principle works in contemporary society, and in light of its historical precedents. The accommodation principle as part of a disability inclusive employment paradigm is a concept of the late twentieth century. It contrasts with earlier vocational rehabilitation programs for people with disabilities, which historically were based on medicalized conceptions of disability [1, 16]. This \u201cMedical Model\u201d of disability focused on individual deficits, with impairments conceived of as infirmities that precluded participation in the mainstream economy [17, 18]. It cast people with disabilities in a subordinate role to doctors, rehabilitation professionals, and governmental bureaucrats, each of whom aimed to \u201chelp them,\u201d when \u201cdeserving,\u201d adjust to a society structured around the convenience, design, and interests of people without disabilities [17].\nIn contrast, the modern model is the Social Model of disability, which is sometimes called the Ecological Model, and, in the context of the ADA, the Disability Civil Rights Model. This model, however named, includes the accommodation principle. It has changed society\u2019s perspective. It has altered the historical paradigm from a focus on a health status to be cured or rehabilitated, and even pitied, towards acceptance of individual differences as human traits that are accommodated in employment, and generally in society, as a natural part of the human experience.\nThe Social Model of disability has taken on exceptional importance due to the health and economic emergency arising from the global pandemic [19, 20]. The pandemic is challenging public and private entities in unprecedented ways to spur both traditional and new forms of employment and economic opportunity for all. But people with disabilities are presently experiencing among the highest rates of job loss, as compared to those without disabilities, from the health and economic emergency [21, 22].\nLest we forget, too, people with disabilities often own or identify with multiple minority identities that are themselves marginalized in our society. People with disabilities, for example, may also be women, people of color, and/or individuals identifying with different sexual orientations and gender identities [23,24,25]. Disability diversity and inclusion (\u201cD&I\u201d) programs that incorporate the accommodation principle for all identities\u2014what my colleagues call \u201cD&I+\u201d\u2014are crucial to people with disabilities who seek to enter or re-enter the mainstream economy."}, {"title": "What Are Reasonable Accommodations at Work (and How to Request Them)?", "article": "Forage puts students first.

See our full editorial guidelines .\nReasonable accommodations are adjustments to a hiring process, work environment, or job responsibilities so an employee with disabilities can apply for or perform their job. Depending on the type of disability, accommodations can look many different ways \u2014 from transcription services to accessible parking outside the office. In this guide, we\u2019ll share more about reasonable accommodations, examples, and how to request them in your job search or at your first job.\nWhat Are Reasonable Accommodations at Work?\nWork accommodations are changes to a hiring process, work environment, or job responsibilities that allow an employee with a disability to apply for or do their job.\nWhat makes an accommodation \u201creasonable?\u201d An accommodation is \u201creasonable\u201d if it doesn\u2019t create an undue hardship on the employer \u2014 meaning it isn\u2019t exceptionally difficult or expensive for the employer to make the accommodation.\nNot every employee with a disability needs the same accommodation; accommodations depend on the individual\u2019s needs and how it affects their ability to do their job. For example, reasonable accommodations can include:\nTechnical access, like an employee with impaired hearing who uses a transcription service\nPhysical accommodations, like a ramp for the office to make it accessible to an employee in a wheelchair\nChanges to work schedules, like more flexible hours for an employee who has mental health challenges and may need more rest periods\nThese accommodations make it so every employee, regardless of ability, can succeed in their job.\nPower BI Passionate about advocating for employees with disabilities and other underrepresented groups in the workplace?

Some common reasonable accommodations include:\nChange of job tasks\nFlexible work schedules, including remote jobs\nImproved office accessibility\nSpecialized software or equipment\nAlternative supervisory structure or methods\nAlternative formats of communication (written versus verbal communication, for example)\nReassignment\nHere\u2019s how some of these accommodations function for various disabilities.\nADHD\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that can affect an employee\u2019s ability to focus, prioritize tasks, stay organized, and control impulses. In the workplace, accommodations for ADHD allow these employees to be productive in a way that works for them \u2014 mainly through adjustments to work schedules and environments.\nExamples of ADHD accommodations at work include:\nA flexible schedule that allows an employee to work when their energy and focus levels are best\nA private or quiet workspace so an employee can work distraction-free\nTask organization tools or software to help an employee prioritize and stay on task\nAdjustments to meetings to make them shorter, have more breaks, and provide a clear agenda beforehand\nMental Health\nMental health conditions like depression and anxiety can affect an employee\u2019s ability to be productive, work closely with others, and work on a typical 9-5 schedule.\nExamples of reasonable accommodations for mental health conditions include:\nFlexible work schedules for an employee who needs to take time during the workday for treatment\nRemote work for an employee who experiences intense social anxiety\nPermission to bring a support animal to the office\nSupportive and direct supervision style for an employee who needs positive reinforcement and feedback\nA quiet work environment, either by providing a space for the employee to work distraction-free or technology like noise-canceling headphones\nPhysical Disabilities\nReasonable accommodations for physical disabilities vary widely and depend on the kind of physical disability a person has. For example, a blind employee and an employee in a wheelchair need very different accommodations to perform their jobs.\nExamples of reasonable accommodations for physical disabilities include:\nAssistive technology, like screen readers, voice recognition software, Braille displays, and specialized input devices to help an employee process or communicate information\nAdjustable workstations for an employee with a physical impairment\nWheelchair accessible offices\nFlexible work arrangements, including working from home, for employees who find it challenging to commute or need time for treatment\nAdjusting job tasks that require physical labor\nDiabetes\nEmployees with diabetes may experience a range of symptoms depending on how their diabetes affects them. For example, some employees may have diabetic neuropathy, a nerve disorder caused by diabetes that affects nerves in the hands and feet. Others may experience diabetic retinopathy, an eye condition that can affect vision.\nExamples of reasonable accommodations for diabetes include:\nFlexible work schedules or regular breaks to check blood glucose levels, eat, take medication, or go to the bathroom\nAccess to technology to regularly check blood glucose levels\nPermission to use a chair or stool for an employee with diabetic neuropathy\nA larger screen, screen readers, or Braille displayers for an employee with diabetic retinopathy\nPregnancy\nPregnancy is not a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); however, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA) is a new law that requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations to employees who experience limitations because of pregnancy, childbirth, or other related medical conditions. These work accommodations include adjustments to work schedules and changes to job tasks.\nExamples of reasonable accommodations for pregnancy in the PWFA include:\nFlexible hours or additional time to eat and rest\nAccess to accessible parking spots\nLeave or time off to recover from childbirth\nExcusal from strenuous physical activity or activities that may expose an employee to compounds not safe for pregnancy\nPregnancy and Breastfeeding\nWhile the PWFA does not have any specific guidance about breast milk pumping, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) specifically covers nursing mothers in the workplace.\nThe PPACA includes two main reasonable accommodations:\nBreak time for an employee to express breast milk, up to one year after giving birth\nA private place out of view and free of intrusion, other than a bathroom, to express breast milk\nReturn to Work for Parents and Carers Coming back from parental or caregiving leave?

According to the ADA National Network, you\u2019re allowed to request \u2014 and must gain access to \u2014 reasonable accommodations at work, as long as:\nYou\u2019re qualified for the position, meaning you\u2019re able to perform the job\u2019s essential functions\nYou meet the definition of \u201cdisability\u201d according to the ADA, meaning you have a \u201cphysical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities\u201d\nThe accommodation doesn\u2019t create an undue burden on the employer, meaning an exceptional difficulty or expense\nReasonable Accommodation Request Process\nReasonable accommodations, by law, must be addressed on a case-by-case basis. According to the ADA Network, the process is as follows:\nAn employee must disclose their disability to their employer and explain how the disability is affecting their ability to do their job. The employee and employer discuss how the disability is affecting the employee\u2019s ability to work and share potential solutions. If the employee\u2019s need for an accommodation is not obvious, the employer can request preliminary documentation of the disability. The employee and employer both provide input on what an effective solution would be. The employer makes the final decision on what the accommodation(s) will be. The employer either implements the accommodation(s) or denies the accommodation request.\nIt\u2019s up to the employee to bring their accommodation request to the employer. While the employer does have the final say, if an employee has a disability, it\u2019s their right to receive reasonable accommodations. They should actively participate in discussions on what those accommodations should be.\nHow to Request Reasonable Accommodations When You\u2019re Just Starting Out\nSo, you\u2019re thinking of requesting reasonable accommodations, whether you\u2019re in your first job search or have just landed your first role. We\u2019ve outlined the step-by-step process, but how should those conversations go?\nIt\u2019s best to be proactive and straightforward while focusing on how you\u2019ll be able to thrive in the role.\n\u201cThe best way is to confront and call out the problem and your expectations directly,\u201d says Roza Szafranek, founder and CEO at HR Hints. \u201cIt is good to clearly name from the beginning what is important to us and ask, for example, about arrangements for hybrid work, the need to work with a mask in common spaces, or the distance between desks in the office, if these are important to us.\u201d\nRequest Examples\nKraig Kleeman, CEO and founder of The New Workforce, a company that connects businesses with talent, gives an example of how someone on the job hunt with ADHD \u2014 who knows they might need extra breaks during the day \u2014 might request accommodations.\n>>MORE: How Can You Tell if an Employer Values Diversity and Inclusion in the Workplace?\n\u201cResearch the companies you\u2019re applying to and check if they have info on accommodations on their websites,\u201d Kleeman says. \u201cOnce you get an offer, that\u2019s the time to discuss your needs.

Focus on how you can rock your new job.\u201d\nWhat to Do If an Employer Denies Your Reasonable Accommodation Request\nUnfortunately, not all reasonable accommodation requests will be approved.\n\u201cApplication rejection happens often,\u201d Szafranek says. \u201cThe most common reasons are savings and lack of willingness or ability to take on more responsibilities in terms of managing the problems of the employed team. Company and team leaders are focusing on optimizing and simplifying everything that does not bring additional revenue and increases the efficiency of the team\u2019s work, so if they consider that, for example, they are unable to negotiate work from the office, they will not budge.\u201d\nWhile an employer might feel strongly that their decision is final, you can try to negotiate a rejection or take further action.\n\u201cIf they do say no, don\u2019t lose heart,\u201d Kleeman says. \u201cTalk to them, explain why it\u2019s essential, and try to work something out. It\u2019s a two-way street. If you do take further action, contact the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for help. They can mediate or investigate. If all else fails, you can consider legal action. But remember, that\u2019s usually the last resort. So, don\u2019t be afraid to speak up and advocate for your needs.

In doing so, accessible tourism futures are shown to be affected by key concepts related to core tourism considerations and major policy initiatives on accessibility and sustainability. Yet, accessible tourism futures also have the potential to create their own momentum and contribute unique learnings on the diversity of tourism markets that will shape tourism concepts and global policy initiatives in their own right.\nA discussion of each of the above areas was placed in context to accessible tourism futures and to contextualise the papers that were selected for the special issue. The latter part of the paper outlines the contribution of each empirical paper to the issue discussing the approach, findings and implications. Stakeholder collaboration was identified as the key common theme of the papers and the factor for developing accessible tourism solutions, recognising the value of the market and capitalising on it. A collaborative approach is required to recognise the complementary nature of the different paradigms; to re-shape and transform the future of the accessible tourism industry. To assist in the development of accessible tourism futures, UD principles should provide a foundation to enhance the future competitiveness of tourism destinations and organisations.\nThree of the authors have extensive academic experience in the area and the fourth author is the Managing Director of the pre-eminent European Network for Accessible Tourism. In taking a limited Delphi approach to canvassing key areas likely to shape accessible tourism futures, the following concepts and policy initiatives were examined: motivations, dreams and aspirations of people with disability; demography; UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; destination competitiveness; universal design (UD); and the UN Sustainable Development Goals for 2030.\nAccessible tourism is evolving as a field of academic research and industry practice, set within a dynamic social context.

The special issue explores theoretical approaches, foundations and issues in the study of accessible tourism from a futures perspective. Accessible tourism, as with any area of academic study is an evolving field of academic research and industry practice, set within a dynamic social context. The field is interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary, and is influenced by geography, ageing and disability studies, economics, public policy, psychology, law, architecture, construction sciences, technology and marketing. Past research has attempted to view, explain and unpack the inherent complexities (Darcy, 2010) within accessible tourism through a variety of lenses, including human rights, critical tourism, embodiment, customer segmentation and universal design (UD), to name a few (see Buhalis and Darcy, 2011; Buhalis et al., 2012). The special issue is timely given the operationalisation of the United Nations (2006) Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities by 160 countries. Central to the convention is the right for tourists with disability to access transport and built environment in Article 9 and tourism experiences, goods and services within Article 30. It is therefore pertinent to look at the future of accessible tourism and contemplate a number of issues including (but not limited to) the role of technology in reshaping disability; if and how policy makers and planners are addressing the impact of accessible tourism in a sustainable manner; the political influence of people with disabilities, who make up the largest minority group in the USA, on the future of tourism; the science fiction of exoskeletons and gene therapy as a new form of adventure tourist; and the future state of embodied identity and accessible tourism. The special issue provides the opportunity for contributors to take part in the current discourses on accessible tourism from a futures perspective, in order that we can understand, manage and contribute to the development of accessible tourism in the context of economically, socially and environmentally sustainable communities. Specific topics included conceptual and research papers, viewpoints and trend papers, both qualitative and quantitative, discussing topics relating to the future of accessible tourism. Papers include a range of issues including: inclusive destinations; accessible tourism in Development Planning (toward the UN Sustainable Development Goals 2030); policy-making for accessible tourism; embodiment; representation; law and legislation; architecture and universal design; inclusion/exclusion from experiences; markets and needs analysis; accessible transport; accessible events; accessibility and culture/heritage; accessible accommodation; education/training; and technology and applications. In contrast to the past 30 years, where disability and tourism research has been largely concerned with overcoming barriers that exclude certain people (see Smith, 1987), we can discern the contours of new movements in accessible tourism, whereby overarching principles and standards of sustainability, social responsibility and customer service. The delivery of equitable tourism experiences demand the attention of sector actors and stakeholders. Accessible tourism, in this context, should be seen in the future as much more than a range of supports to excluded target groups, becoming a set of ground rules and codes of practice which contribute to the development of all tourism offers and destinations in an inclusive way. If we should gaze into the crystal ball for a moment, we could envisage that tourism will not be defined primarily in terms of different target groups, since principles of responsibility, sustainability and accessibility will in the future inform the quality criteria to which all destinations should comply and be judged as part of destination competitiveness in increasingly global context. Customers will become more aware of their individual rights and also the need to protect and sustain communities and the natural environment, influencing tourism service providers to follow generally accepted rules of service quality, genuine interactivity and engagement with the local culture, people and resources. The capability of tourism providers to recognise those rights for all (e.g. of tourists with disabilities, Design for All, responsible behaviour, inclusion of the local communities in a transparent system of remuneration and participation, working opportunities for socially excluded group etc.) is going to be the threshold, which determines whether their offers will succeed or fail in the future. The tourism sector will increasingly be seen as having transformational power as \u201ca shaper of society\u201d, acting as a promoter of jobs and economic growth, a participant in regional and community planning and a partner in global development programmes. In addition, tourism should be developed as industry that promotes understanding, inclusion and well-being for all in an equitable way. Businesses, destinations and networks, that are already active in the field of accessible tourism and/or representing markets with different specific requirements will participate more widely in the mainstream, bringing their expertise and knowledge to bear on all those issues that are still seen as \u201cdifferent types of tourism\u201d. In the development of accessible destinations and experiences, the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (2015) will be playing an increasingly supportive role, especially through its Global Code for Ethics in Tourism and the recently published Manuals on Accessible Tourism (2015), produced by ONCE Foundation and the European Network for Accessible Tourism (2015b). Before discussing the papers that have been selected for publication we would like to set the scene by examining some major conceptual and policy development areas that we believe will have a significant influence on accessible tourism futures in the future. These include: dreams and aspirations of people with disability; demography; UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; destination competitiveness frameworks; UD; and the newly adopted UN Sustainable Development Goals for 2030. Each of these areas of influence will now be outlined prior to the papers for the special edition being summarised for their contribution to the future of accessible tourism.\nDefining and conceptualising accessible tourism Conceptualising accessible tourism to reflect all its dimensions and multidisciplinarity is critical for the future. The study of tourism and disability has been a reasonably recent phenomenon with the first detailed examination emerging from the leisure constraints literature (Smith, 1987). From this beginning, a great deal of individual studies are emerged that documented significant issues with demand, supply and coordination of travel for people with disability. More recently the field has started to mature with a conceptualisation that has sought to make sense out of the individual studies and provide an overall framework for understanding the phenomena. To assist with this conceptualisation, Buhalis and Darcy (2011) offer the following definition: Accessible tourism is a form of tourism that involves collaborative processes between stakeholders that enables people with access requirements, including mobility, vision, hearing and cognitive dimensions of access, to function independently and with equity and dignity through the delivery of universally designed tourism products, services and environments. This definition adopts a whole of life approach where people through their lifespan benefit from accessible tourism provision. These include people with permanent and temporary disabilities, seniors, obese, families with young children and those working in safer and more socially sustainably designed environments (adapted from Darcy and Dickson, 2009, p. 34 in Buhalis and Darcy, 2011, pp. 10-11). Importantly the definition recognises collaboration between stakeholders across demand, supply and coordination to recognise that disability is a complex construct involving mobility, vision, hearing, cognitive and other embodiments. The definition recognises that developing inclusive destinations and accessible tourism experiences also benefit other groups in the community. Hence, it contributes toward a greater social sustainability of the industry by including and, hence, providing for a much broader cross-section of consumers that has previously been considered by the industry. In understanding the importance of individuals with disability, the stakeholders they engage with and the influence of UD on the products, services and environments they wish to seek enabling experiences. Buhalis and Darcy (2011) suggests that to develop accessible tourism futures destination managers must strategically plan through the lens of UD. Figure 1 outlines the cyclical strategic approach to engaging UD approaches across disability and lifespan considerations as a foundation for developing future accessible destination experiences.\nDreams and aspirations of people with disability The dreams and aspirations of individuals play a fundamental role in shaping the choices, which lead them to travel. Among people who live with a disability, the idea of leaving behind one\u2019s everyday surroundings and going on a journey can create significant anxiety (Darcy, 1998). People with disability often can design or influence their everyday environment whilst they have routines to negotiate any difficulties and thresholds that exist. This does not apply to new environments whilst travelling, where they do not have prior knowledge, networks or influence on the design nor the potential barriers that are to face and the way to overcome them. Indeed, a recent European survey (GfK, 2015) suggests that up to half of people with disability do not travel on holiday, due to a combination of lack of reliable information, lack of funds and previous bad experiences. Yet, the desire to travel remains with studies showing that it is not a person\u2019s impairment that impedes their travel but a series of interpersonal, attitudinal structural constraints (Daniels et al., 2005; Darcy, 2003). In recognising that a person's impairment does not constrain their travel motivations, the boundaries to what is regarded as accessible tourism destinations and experiences are continually pushed by the accessible explorers who forge new pathways for others to follow.\nMillennium development goals (MDGs) and the UN global compact At the Millennium Summit in September 2000 the largest gathering of world leaders in history adopted the UN Millennium Declaration, committing their nations to a global partnership to reduce extreme poverty and setting a series of targets, with a deadline of 2015. These targets, known as the MDGs are a set of eight specific goals set by the 191 United Nations member countries that have the goal of halving world poverty by the year 2015: Eradicating extreme poverty continues to be one of the main challenges of our time, and is a major concern of the international community. Ending this scourge will require the combined efforts of all, governments, civil society organizations and the private sector, in the context of a stronger and more effective global partnership for development. The Millennium Development Goals set timebound targets, by which progress in reducing income poverty, hunger, disease, lack of adequate shelter and exclusion \u2013 while promoting gender equality, health, education and environmental sustainability \u2013 can be measured. They also embody basic human rights \u2013 the rights of each person on the planet to health, education, shelter and security. The Goals are ambitious but feasible and, together with the comprehensive United Nations development agenda, set the course for the world\u2019s efforts to alleviate extreme poverty by 2015 (United Nations Secretary-General BAN Ki-moon). The aim of the MDGs is to encourage development by improving social and economic conditions in the world\u2019s poorest countries. Since the MDG\u2019s were agreed to significant progress has been made. To date average overall incomes have increased by approximately 21 per cent. The number of people living in extreme poverty declined by an estimated 130 million. Chile mortality rates fell from 103 deaths per 1,000 live births a year to 88. Life expectancy rose from 63 years to 65 years. An additional 8 per cent of the developing world\u2019s people received access to clean water and an additional 15 per cent acquired access to improved sanitation services. In 2015 the UN countries will adopt a new sustainable development agenda and a new global agreement on climate change. The actions taken in 2015 are expected to result in new sustainable development goals that build on the eight MDG\u2019s (United Nations, 2015). Tourism has long been seen as having significant potential to help achieve the MDG\u2019s in developing countries. For example in 1990 developing countries had 18 per cent of international tourism receipts. By 2005 this had risen to 30 per cent and to date it continues to rise. There has been significant promotion of the direct economic links between tourists and the poor. Tourism may provide employment opportunities for marginalised groups, may bring direct income to individual communities and may promote equality in developing countries (Saarinen and Rogerson, 2013).\nUD supports destination competitiveness The tourism industry needs to design and deliver offerings and services that are suitable to all potential users and remove any physical or organisational barriers that can prevent visitation. UD incorporates the accessibility requirements of people with the widest possible range of abilities, so that the greatest number of people can use mainstream products and services without the need for adaptations or special interfaces. Additionally, mainstream products and services should use interface standards which match those of technical aids, so allowing disabled people to access and use mainstream equipment. UD has been defined as: Universal design is the design of products and environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design. The intent of the universal design concept is to simplify life for everyone by making products, communications, and the built environment more usable by more people at little or no extra cost. The universal design concept targets all people of all ages, sizes and abilities\u2019. The Universal Design approach goes beyond traditional design, which tends to focus on the \u2018average\u2019 user. Universal Design is a design approach, reflecting a way of understanding people\u2019s needs. It is not a list of particular solutions, measurements, or products \u2013 Universal Design is the way to reach the solution, contributing to social inclusion (cited in Center for Universal Design, 2009; and first articulated by Mace, 1985). Applying the principles of UD can be seen as a way of developing tourism environments, transportation, services and offers, underpinning sustainable communities and businesses. Today, according to a recent study by European Network for Accessible Tourism (2015a) and partners, less than 10 per cent of tourism suppliers in Europe offer \u201caccessible\u201d tourism services, while demand for such services is set to increase due to the ageing population and continuing upward trend in market demand. Adopting UD enlarges the target markets of destinations as well as ensures that more pleasant experiences can be delivered. Therefore it can increase the market base, reduce seasonality and support the competitiveness of destinations (Buhalis, 2000). Yet, few studies have examined accessible tourism in relation to destination management and only recently has accessible tourism been examined from destination competitiveness perspective (Dom\u00ednguez Vila et al., 2015).\nPapers in this issue To address these concepts and developments this special issue is bringing a range of papers together that discuss research on many accessibility tourism aspects. Naniopoulos and Tsalis (2015) discuss a methodology for addressing the accessibility of monuments. They focus on heritage attraction sites, highlighting the challenges with archaeological sites where interventions become problematic or even impossible. In doing so, they approached accessibility as a dual notion; accessibility of an area and its potential for independent physical access and movement around the monuments as well as perceived accessibility in terms of interpreting, understanding and learning from the environment. The methodology was applied to a number of byzantine monuments as part of a cultural route in the city of Thessaloniki in Greece, as case studies. Results provide both tools for assessing monument accessibility (process orientations and checklists) and insights into the needs of travellers with disabilities for more \u201cusable\u201d heritage attractions. Concluding remarks place a focus on the prerequisites of training and cooperation to allow for the future of accessible monuments to be realised. Tsalis et al. (2015) provide an interesting study on the challenges of implementing accessibility solutions, also within the context of protection, conservation, and management of historical centres and monuments. Viewed from a tourism perspective, archaeological sites and monuments are location bound and exist only in their original place. Hence, access to such sites enables unique and authentic tourism experiences. Discourses on objective, constructive and existential authenticity are of paramount importance when accessibility is concerned. This study provides relevant examples of accessibility interventions on six monuments as well as considerations on the design of the tools that assisted site interpretation and interconnection in a cultural route. Results demonstrate how accessibility improvements can occur while respecting the history, architecture and character of the monuments. The study concludes by emphasizing that it is primarily through providing greater access, that the \u201csocialisation\u201d of these monuments will propagate authentic tourism experiences in the future. Bowtell (2015) offers an examination of the market value and attractiveness of accessible tourism in Europe. Historic data were used to provide a forecast for 2025, while primary data obtained from travel and leisure companies provided insights into managerial perceptions. Findings show a very promising potential for accessible tourism market with significant projected revenues. However, a number of challenges including lack of awareness, cost of investments, complexity of customers\u2019 needs and legal inconsistencies within the EU, create barriers toward developing comprehensive solutions for accessible tourism. Authors provide recommendations on bridging demand and supply. Gillovic and McIntosh (2015) present an interesting study on stakeholder perspectives of the future of accessible tourism in New Zealand. The study provides insights into the current situation and the future propensity for an accessible tourism industry in New Zealand. A number of interviews with key stakeholders revealed that there is a need to develop a culture of accessibility that is perceived as the norm. Findings also include the business and demand arguments, but additionally highlighted the \u201cineptness\u201d of upper industry levels to recognize the opportunity of accessible tourism, exhibiting apathy and complacency instead. Authors conclude with recommendations for the future of accessible tourism in New Zealand which can easily be generalised for other regions. Zajadacz (2015) discusses the evolution of models of disability as a basis for the future development of accessible tourism. A review of medical, social, biopsychosocial, geographical and economic models of disability reveals the theoretical underpinnings and assumptions entailed in those. These are then linked to tourism, demonstrating that different models influence the tourism provision in terms of both products and services. Authors highlight the understanding of disability under different models toward diverse tourism experiences. Several suggestions are offered on the complementary of the models and the implications on the transformation of the accessible tourism industry in the future. Cruces Portales (2015) uses a scenario planning approach to envisage alternative futures for accessible tourism. With a timeframe leading to 2050, four alternative futures are unravelled through storytelling. The scenarios are built on a matrix that includes the opposing forces of empathy \u2013 apathy, and fear of loss and certainty of benefits. The resulting, aptly named scenarios (Eden Gardens, Golden Bridge, Wasted Future and State of Hope) showcase different behaviours, schedules of changes and insights. Authors conclude with strategic ideas and proposals for the future of accessible tourism.\nConclusion When exploring the future of tourism in this area two opposing trends can be observed: future societies are predicted to become more similar, more homogenous as a consequence of consumerism, globalisation and converging urban lifestyles. However, the accessible tourism market is characteristically diverse, with complex needs and the range of dreams and ambitions is boundless. Will future global travellers be able to access more varied and personal services or will increasing numbers of travellers give rise to greater standardization of services? Accessible tourism as an emerging field of study will influence tourism destination competitiveness in the future, whether that be from a human rights, emerging market segment or service delivery perspective. In this conceptual examination, we have presented implications of number of theoretical constructs and lenses through which accessible tourism will be influenced in the future. In this special issue, a number of future dimensions are explored that demonstrate how the field has moved from an examination of the intersection of disability and tourism, to one that is clearly defined through conceptual and definitional approaches as accessible tourism. There is a common thread amongst all the papers presented in this special issue. They focus around stakeholder collaboration, as a foundation for the future development of accessible tourism. It has been explicitly suggested that raising awareness amongst stakeholders is essential to overcome barriers inhibiting the application of solutions that enhance access. The importance of stakeholder collaboration across the accessible tourism value chain has been emphasized in a number of ways in this special issue. Improving accessibility of facilities, transportation, attractions and destinations more generally, demands the collaboration of a wide range of stakeholders including architects, designers, economists, local councils, policy makers, travellers with disabilities, historians and archaeologists to name a few. Therefore \u201csocialising\u201d tourism means that access can be granted only when a number of relevant stakeholders are in accord, work together and specifically developed strategies to target the accessible tourism market. Stakeholder collaboration is a key factor for developing accessible tourism solutions, recognising the value of the market and capitalising on it. Hence, a collaborative approach is required to recognise the complementary nature of the different paradigms; to re-shape and transform the future of the accessible tourism through influencing the tourism industry, contributing government organisations and the not-for-profit sectors. The strength and depth of stakeholder collaborations will determine alternative future realities; from a future where all cooperate and share benefits for all parties, to a fatalistic picture where each stakeholder is sailing alone because they consider their interests incompatible, and everything in between. UD should provide a better accessible tourism future that should enhance the competitiveness of tourism destinations and organisations."}, {"title": "Tourism Accessibility for Impaired", "article": "\u201cI have a wife and three children. If I can\u2019t use a product or service, then the business loses not only one person\u2019s business, but five.\u201d\nAs seen in the above quote, Martin Heng emphasizes that people with disabilities and people with different access needs do travel, and are likely to travel with others. And these travelers represent, according to the Amadeus Accessibility Study, a \"$70 billion market\" just in Europe and the USA.\nThis fact alone would make a strong business case for investing time, effort, and resources needed to become more accessible and inclusive as a business and as an industry. But beyond the economic imperative, there are important reasons for the tourism industry to take this segment seriously.\nBelow are some ideas and insights on how and why we should promote not just accessibility, but also inclusive tourism that benefits everyone as well as relevant industry resources for tourism businesses and destinations seeking to better understand accessible and inclusive tourism, and to improve their practices. Parts of the content featured here have been inspired by and based on Martin's presentation (originally recorded on July 18th, 2019 as part of the GSTC Sustainable Tourism Training Online Course).\nTourism for All: Including As Many Different Groups As Possible\nContrary to what many might think, accessible tourism is not just about providing facilities that are wheel-chair accessible.\nSenior travelers. Parents traveling with small kids. Travelers with allergies and other medical conditions. These are all different types of travelers who have different degrees of accessibility restrictions and mobility requirements.\nAnd a large proportion of travelers with disabilities have \"invisible\" impairments (such as cognitive or mental health conditions and long-term illnesses) that may not be, unlike wheelchair users, immediately obvious just by looking at them.\nWhen planning for and communicating about the accessibility features and services you provide, therefore, rather than simply using the \"handicap symbol\" (the ubiquitously used sign of a wheelchair user - the top-left pictogram on the above image), these various areas of accessibility needs must be considered and appropriately indicated.\nShare on your website and brochures, for example, if you provide assistive listening devices on your tour, or if sign language interpretation is available within any of the attractions you visit.\n\"Tourism for All\" is a concept that is addressing a growing segment of travelers with a diverse range of needs and requirements. What is \"accessible\" to one traveler who is a wheelchair user, for example, may be very difficult to access or completely inaccessible to another traveler with a different type of disability, mobility impairment or other conditions.\nThat's why becoming more inclusive is a more appropriate goal for the tourism industry than focusing just on \"accessible tourism\" (which can be vague and hard to define - accessible for whom?).\nAn inclusive tourism business or destination works to offer positive travel experiences to people with different needs by addressing them from various perspectives, and by providing design and service solutions that aim to cover as many different groups as possible.\nUniversal Design: Designing for Everyone, Being a Good Host\nWhen it comes to being inclusive and promoting Tourism for All, a key concept that underlies the solutions to be implement by tourism businesses and destinations is Universal Design.\nThe definition of Universal Design is as follows:\nUniversal Design is the design and composition of an environment so that it can be accessed, understood and used to the greatest extent possible by all people regardless of their age, size, ability or disability. An environment (or any building, product, or service in that environment) should be designed to meet the needs of all people who wish to use it. This is not a special requirement, for the benefit of only a minority of the population. It is a fundamental condition of good design. If an environment is accessible, usable, convenient and a pleasure to use, everyone benefits.\n- Centre for Excellence in Universal Design, \" What is Universal Design\nTo understand where you need to improve in order to offer universally accessible experience for everyone's benefit, take some time to reflect on the whole customer journey from the perspectives of guests with different access needs and mobility requirements.\nThink about how they experience travel - from the customer finding your business, to booking their trip, to arriving in your destination, to getting around during their stay.\nAre there steps to enter the restaurant that will make it difficult for customers with limited mobility? Does your hotel offer an accessible and easy-to-follow process for guests with disabilities to check in/out and get around within the property? And is your website designed for users with different needs (e.g. individuals with hearing or vision impairment)?\nBusinesses often have barriers that make it difficult for customers with particular access or mobility impairments to enjoy a certain product or service, because of the lack of awareness that those barriers exist.\nAnd in some cases, businesses may be \"rejecting\" prospective customers without ever knowing. The 2016 Click-Away Pound study found that \"71% of customers with access needs will click away from a website that they find difficult to use\".\nWith all the different types of accessibility requirements, it may seem difficult or impossible to anticipate and accommodate the various needs of your customers. But it's important to remember that in tourism we are in the business of providing services to welcome guests; and that it is in fact your responsibility as a host to cater to the needs of your guests and to make them feel welcome.\nIt's part of being a good host.\nBy considering the diverse needs and abilities of all throughout the design process, universal design creates products, services and environments that meet peoples' needs. Simply put, universal design is good design. - Centre for Excellence in Universal Design, \"What is Universal Design\"\nInclusive Growth and Sustainable Development\nWith the growing importance of the accessible tourism market, and especially the spending power of this market segment including the \"multiplier effect\" (each traveler with impairment is likely to influence the purchase decisions of multiple members of their party), there is a strong economic imperative to be considered. To remain competitive, your tourism business and destination should be investing in universal design and inclusive solutions.\nBeyond the economic imperative, however, there are also key reasons why inclustive tourism should be part of the global sustainable tourism agenda.\nWith an estimated 15% of the world population living with some forms of disabilities (World Health Organization, World Report on Disability 2011), and the changing demographic of the \"rapidly ageing\" populations around the world (WHO, Aging and Life Course), sustainable development can only be achieved through an inclusive approach to creating solutions and opportunities.\nThe United Nations' \"Disability and Development Report: Realizing the Sustainable Development Goals by, for and with persons with disabilities\" (2018) recognizes that \"striving to achieve disability-inclusive development is not only the right thing to do, it is also the practical thing to do,\" as \"the success of the 2030 Agenda requires a participatory and inclusive approach in which all stakeholders, including persons with disabilities, are engaged.\"\nAnd that's why Tourism for All is highlighted in the Global Sustainable Tourism Criteria, the baseline standard for sustainability in travel and tourism.\nSource: Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC)\nAnd in the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO)'s Global Code of Ethics for Tourism.\nSource: UNWTO, Global Code of Ethics for Tourism\nInclusion in the Work Place\nHaving understood the importance of striving for universal design and working towards becoming more inclusive, what can tourism businesses do to get started? What are some of the first steps?\nOne of the key challenges when considering steps to becoming more inclusive is to understand the diverse needs of your customers and your prospective customers. The barriers that prevent some people from having a positive travel experience - whether they may be steps that cannot be climbed, signs that cannot be read, or buttons that cannot be reached - are hard to notice unless you put yourself in the position of those with particular disabilities and impairments.\nOne of the most effective ways for businesses to understand the various accessibility needs of their customers is to have team members who know and represent the perspectives of those customers. In short, hire people with disabilities. Empower them to help make your business more inclusive, both within your operations and through your products and services.\nThe UNWTO report \"Recommendations on Accessible Tourism\" (2013) states that \"the staff of tourism establishments and related services should be prepared to know, understand and address the needs of customers with disabilities\", and \"the staff should include employees who know how to communicate with persons with sensory disabilities.\"\n\"The hospitality industry serves travellers from all over the world. The diversity of cultures implies a diversity of customer expectations as well. The hotels with a diverse workforce to cater to such a wide customer base hold a strong competitive advantage over others. ... [To] have employees that understand the needs and requirements of the customers and provide key insights into making properties progressively accessible is also a crucial element of the overall business strategy.\" - Hospitality Workers Training Centre, \"Disability Inclusion in the Hospitality Industry Makes Business Sense\"\nBusiness Examples: Staff Diversity and Inclusion\nLemon Tree Hotels Limited, India\nWinner of the 2019 Tourism for Tomorrow Awards, in the category \"Investing in People\", Lemon Tree Hotels have focused on creating a socially inclusive work environment, bringing together people of different backgrounds, abilities and ethnicities to work as a unified team with a common goal. Lemon Tree supports \"opportunity deprived\" workers, including those with physical, social or economic disabilities, by creating and offering opportunities to realize their full potential and live with dignity.\nIlunion Hotels, Spain\nFifty percent of ILUNION Hotels' employees have disabilities. The hotel is committed to integrating its approach to universal accessibility not just in its services for customers with disabilities, but also throughout its business model, including its employees and suppliers. Illunion Hotels received the 2016 UNWTO Ethics Award for its work in the area of accessible tourism for all and its contribution to change attitudes, break down social barriers and make the accommodation industry more inclusive.\nEinsmehr Hotel\nPhoto: hoteleinsmehr\nLocated in Augsburg, Germany, Einsmehr Hotel is an inclusive hotel with about half of its workforce consisting of people with disabilities. The hotel works with a local association \"einsmehr\" (\"one more\"), which supports people with the Down Syndrome in the surrounding area, seeking to create jobs and a labor market for people with (mental) disabilities.\nSV Tenacious\nSource: Martin Heng\nOperated by the UK-based Jubilee Sailing Trust (JST), SV Tenacious is the largest wooden tall ship, and the only one of its kind designed and built to be fully accessible for people with disabilities or impairments (including wheelchair users).\nMartin Heng, who joined Tenacious\u2019 voyage from Sydney to Melbourne in 2018, describes his experience in this Lonely Planet blog:\n\"There are no passengers on JST voyages, only crew \u2013 made up of nine permanent crew members and 30 to 40 voyage crew \u2013 and everyone is expected to fulfil their duties to the best of their ability, whatever that ability is. Experiencing a voyage on Tenacious (or her sister ship Lord Nelson) is an object lesson in the benefits of inclusion and accessibility. People living with a disability can challenge themselves, experience adventure and explore what they are capable of given the opportunity, while able-bodied crew members are shown that disability doesn\u2019t necessarily mean incapacity.\" - Martin Heng, \"Setting sail for accessible adventure on the SV Tenacious\" (Lonely Planet)\nThis amazing example of SV Tenacious is a good reason for all of us in the tourism industry to be asking, as Martin challenges us, \"If they can do this, what excuse do we have not to make mainstream tourism operations more accessible?\"\nSo a better question here, instead of \u201cHow can tourism become more inclusive?\u201d, may be, \u201cwhat are we not (yet) doing to make tourism more inclusive, and how are we going to push for change?\""}, {"title": "Universal Design and Tourism: Why it\u2019s crucial that we focus on accessibility", "article": "In a world where 15% of the population is living with some form of disability and where our population is also steadily ageing it is more important than ever to consider universal design in every industry planning to be operational in our ageing future.\nThe World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) understands this crucial importance and have called for more investment and improved management for disabled tourists globally. The WTTC has outlined two main priorities for destinations wanting to focus on universal design and tourism;\nTo understand the market\u2019s dynamics and opportunities so that operators can prioritise actions accordingly. This includes looking at what leaders in the space are providing and learn from them, as often some simple adaptations or a mere awareness of the needs of people with a disability can make a big difference.

You're definitely not alone! Despite the regulations in place to provide accessibility for individuals with disabilities, the reality doesn't always match our expectations. Sadly, this has become far too common. But fear not, we're here to shed light on some of the common pitfalls and offer practical advice to ensure your hotel booking experience is better than before. Let's dive in and uncover some of the crucial aspects of ADA hotels together, so you can feel more confident and empowered as a traveler.\nWhat is ADA?\nPassed in 1990, The American with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination against those who have a disability. The public sectors that fall under this code includes equal opportunity for employment, provision for public transportation access, government services, telecommunications, and businesses that are open to the public (including hotels). The public accommodation industry specifically falls under Title III, which outlines the requirements for all hotels to follow in the U.S. (with some exceptions that are explained later in this article).\nADA Hotel - Wheelchair Accessible\nAccording to the ADA, a person with a disability is someone who:\nHas a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.\nHas a history or record of such an impairment (such as cancer that is in remission)\nis perceived by others as having such an impairment (such as a person who has scars from a severe burn).\nThis article is dedicated specifically to ADA hotel requirements, an area that can present a unique challenges for travelers with disabilities. The unfortunate circumstances that occur far too often is the lack of opportunities for the disability community, primarily due to the lack of accessibility and available information. That has slowly been changing in a positive direction, however, there is certainly still work to be done.\nGeneral Hotel Requirements:\nThe number of requirements is quite extensive and include a plethora of information that cannot fully be detailed in a single article. We will outline some of the general hotel regulations and then get into some of the more specifics regarding ADA hotel room requirements.\nParking\nWhen it comes to parking, ADA regulations specify that a specific number of accessible parking spots must be provided based on the total number of parking spaces available in the hotel lot.\nThis includes designated accessible van spaces and standard accessible spots conveniently located with curb ramps right outside the access area.\nADA Compliant Parking for Individuals with Disability\nEntrances & Lobby\nADA regulations require that entrances to hotels be accessible for individuals with disabilities. While automatic doors are not a mandatory requirement, the entrances must be at least 32 inches wide to accommodate wheelchair users. Additionally, the area around the entrance must be relatively flat, being no steeper than 1.15 degrees to ensure that wheelchair users can enter without the risk of rolling or encountering obstacles. The registration desk needs to have a lowered portion that is a maximum of 36\", and the same goes for the self-serve breakfast areas.\nElevators\nIf the hotel consists of more than 2 stories, including a basement level, an elevator is required that reaches every level, with entrances wide enough to accommodate wheelchair users.\nThis is merely a snippet of the detailed ADA regulations for hotels and accommodations. To learn more, click here.\nWhat does ADA Hotel Room Mean?\nAn ADA hotel room meets the required specifications that fall under the ADA law, created to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to the hotel facilities and amenities. There is a lot of information on ada hotel room requirements, so let's go over some of the more important ones. Later on in the article, we will go over some of the flaws with ADA regulations so that you can be better prepared when booking.\nADA Compliant Bathroom Dimensions:\nClear Passage Width: Bathroom doors in all guest-rooms must allow a clear passage width of at least 32 inches.\nClear Floor Space on Pull Side: On the pull side of each bathroom door, including entry doors and connecting room doors, there must be a minimum of 18 inches of clear floor space.\nTurning Space: ADA requires a clear floor space at least 60\" in diameter, or a \"T\" turn area, for wheelchair users to be able to turn around.\nAccessible Toilet Requirements: The toilet in each accessible guest-room bathroom should meet specific criteria, including:\nBeing centered 18 inches from the adjacent side wall to allow sufficient space for individuals with mobility impairments to use grab bars.\nHaving horizontal grab bars along the adjacent side wall and behind the toilet, mounted between 33 and 36 inches above the floor, for stabilization and assistance during transfers from a wheelchair.\nHaving a toilet seat height between 17 and 19 inches above the floor.\nWheelchair Accessible Hotel | Wheel the World\nThe Sink Requirements:\nBeing no more than 34 inches high, with at least 29 inches of clearance under the front edge to allow wheelchair users to pull under the lavatory and use the faucet hardware.\nHaving insulated or otherwise protected drain and hot water pipes to prevent contact.\nHaving a faucet that is easily operable with one hand, without tight grasping, pinching, or twisting of the wrist.\nFloor Space and Towel Racks: There should be clear floor space in each accessible guest-room bathroom to allow individuals who use wheelchairs to turn around comfortably. Additionally, towel racks or bars should be placed within reach, either within 54 inches of the floor for side approach or 48 inches of the floor for forward approach.\nSlip-Resistant Floors: All bathroom floors in accessible rooms must be slip-resistant to prevent falls, particularly for individuals who use crutches and walkers.\nADA Bed Requirements\nIn each accessible room with one bed, there should be a minimum of 36\" of clear space on both sides of the bed, allowing individuals who use wheelchairs to transfer onto the bed from either side. In rooms with two beds positioned next to each other, there should be a minimum of 36\" of space between them.\nThere must be a clear passage at the foot of each bed that is at least 36\" wide. However, there is no actual requirement for bed heights, which has been a common problem for people with disabilities.\nLater on we will go through what this actually means and what you should know about the bed requirements. (It\u2019s not as clear or accessible as you may think)\nAccessible Bed Height | Wheel the World\nWhat is an ADA Shower in a Hotel?\nADA compliant hotel rooms must have roll-in showers with no threshold and must be at least 30 inches by 60 inches in size. Within the shower is typically a fixed folding seat between 17 and 19 inches above the floor, making it conducive for wheelchair users to be able to transfer out of their chair and into the shower seat. The faucet should be easily reachable with one hand and a horizontal bar should be installed alongside the shower seat to aid in the transfers. Check out this article for a more in-depth explanation of roll-in showers.\nAccessible Hotel with a Roll-in Shower | Wheel the World\nProblems with ADA\nOne of the common misconceptions is that just because a hotel is regarded as ADA compliant, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it will be fully accessible. Unfortunately, it has become commonplace for wheelchair users to arrive to the hotel only to find that the accessible room they booked and requested is not available, or the advertised room and information was entirely inaccurate.\nA 2022 study conducted by MMGY Travel Intelligence found that 96% of travelers with a disability have encountered problems with accommodation, particularly with showers that are often inaccessible, bed heights that are too high, and a general lack of information on the website that prevented the travelers from booking. Does that sound familiar? The data shows that if you are disabled, it probably does.\nAn Expert\u2019s Opinion\nSo, why do these problems occur in spite of ADA regulations supposedly being created to prevent these issues? Kelly Narowski, a wheelchair-user, experienced traveler and ADA expert, explains some of the flaws found in ADA hotels.\n\u201cAnother complaint I've heard is about smaller hotels. Any hotel with less than 50 rooms does NOT have to have a roll-in shower room. With 0-25 rooms, they must have one ADA tub room, and with 26-50, they must have two, but the ADA doesn't require any roll-in shower rooms unless the hotel or motel has at least 51 guest-rooms\u201d. - Kelly Narowski, ADA Expert\nBed Height: \u201cThere is nothing at all in the ADA regulations that mandates bed heights. So, what you see in the USA a lot is high beds and sometimes VERY high beds. It's dangerous, and sometimes impossible, for some wheelchair users to get into these high beds. Conversely, people that have higher (usually power) wheelchairs like the higher beds, but it's my belief that people who like higher beds are the minority. An ideal bed height range for most wheelchair users is 22-25\" off the ground. Something else to consider is that the ADA doesn't address space under the bed.\u201d\nInterior door weight: \u201cWhile it does mandate door PRESSURE (5 pounds), the regulations say nothing about weight. So, sometimes doors to enter hotel rooms are quite heavy, and too heavy for some wheelchair users to open independently\u201d.\nRemovable objects: \u201cAny removable objects in the room are not covered. So, for instance, they can put a big chair in an ADA room and it can be in the way. As long as they provide the mandated turn radius, the furniture isn't covered. Another example, desk heights can be high or low. As a wheelchair user, I've stayed at hotels where the desk is too low for me to fit under\u201d.\nAccording to Kelly, most people who are able-bodied do not know anything, or very little, about ADA regulations except if they work in the field. Similarly, most individuals with disabilities don\u2019t know the ADA requirements either, and if they do, they don\u2019t tend to know them very well. By familiarizing yourself with ADA, you can become better equipped to navigate various situations and advocate for accessibility during your travels within the U.S.\nAccessible Bathroom in a Hotel | Wheel the World\nSteps to Take Before Booking\nThere is certainly more information out there now than there ever was before, due to the increasing awareness of inclusive and accessible travel. However, as the data suggests, common problems still occur. Here are some ways to mitigate the potential issues before you book.\nResearch hotel accessibility: Conduct thorough research on the accessibility features of the hotels you're considering. Look for information on their website, online reviews, and consider calling the hotel directly. You\u2019ll want to verify that the accessible room you requested is available during the travel dates, and that all of the available information is accurate.\nJoin an Accessible Travel Group: Many online forums and groups are available online where you can ask for advice, receive suggestions, and find reliable information from individuals who share similar experiences being disabled. Wheel the World hosts a Facebook group of over 4,500 members that discuss all things accessible travel, making it a great place to start.\nAccessible Booking Platforms: One of the more reliable options is to go through a booking platform dedicated to providing accessibility for travelers. You can find accessible hotels in over 250 destinations worldwide, with guaranteed accessibility, when you book with a company like Wheel the World.\nHow is accessibility guaranteed? Through the Mapping Program at Wheel the World, mappers take detailed measurements and gather accessibility information at every hotel, with 200 data points. This includes bed height, door width, toilet height, the accessibility environment, and a lot more, making Wheel the World the best way to book your hotel room for an accessible stay.\nHere's How it Works:\nSign up at Wheel the World. Create an accessibility profile by selecting your travel accessibility needs (bed height, shower preferences, door width, and more) And thats it, you're done! Now you can search accessible hotels around the world that match your accessibility needs. Once you select and book one, Wheel the World does the rest. The accessibility profile will also help with other offerings, such as activities and transportation, making your travels completely accessible.

The travel planners will call the hotels directly and confirm the room you booked is available, will coordinate the booked activities, and organize the requested transportation.\nAccessible Hotels with accurate and reliable information.\nHopefully, this article has provided you with valuable insight into ADA hotel regulations and the important exclusions that exist. It's crucial to be aware of the nuances and challenges that individuals with disabilities may face when booking hotel accommodations. Despite the occasional lack of information, there are still ways to ensure a guaranteed accessible hotel during your travels. By conducting thorough research, utilizing accessible travel groups, and booking through reliable platforms, you can make informed decisions and have a more accessible and enjoyable stay. Empower yourself as a disabled traveler and advocate for your needs, because everyone deserves equal access and the opportunity to explore the world."}, {"title": "A guide to accessible hotel rooms", "article": "An accessible hotel room is a room that can be used and enjoyed by everyone, no matter their degree of mobility. This means that the hotel room is designed to accommodate individuals with reduced mobility or people with any kind of disability. It should be in the hands of the hotel to properly make their rooms within reach of all target audiences, whether your country makes it a requirement or not.\nIn this article, we\u2019ll look at what is an accessible hotel room and the eight elements that a hotel room must include in order to be able to be inclusive and accommodate any kind of guest.\nWhat is an accessible hotel room?\nWhile in a perfect world, all hotel rooms would be made to suit any kind of guest, the idea of an accessible hotel room is that there are special accommodations made for guests with any kind of disabilities, including individuals with impaired vision, those with hearing loss, and reduced mobility. This means that the room is designed while thinking about the needs of this kind of client so that they can move around in the room comfortably.\nIn some countries, like the United States, hotels are obligated to have a certain percentage of their rooms be accessible, across different floors and for different room types. This means that these rooms that are created for people with disabilities are required to include roll-in showers, toilets with bars on the sides, wide entryways to accommodate wheelchair maneuvering and other elements that we will discuss in more detail below.\nEight elements that accessible hotel rooms must include\nWhile there are many types of disabilities, as a hotelier, it is your responsibility to create an inclusive hotel that is welcoming to all individuals no matter their degree or kind of disability. This can be done by creating smart rooms that help use technology to make rooms more accessible with elements like voice technology. We will look at some of the key elements that these types of rooms must include so that they can be hospitable for all guests.\nVoice technology is an excellent tool to contribute to accessibility because this way your guests can control light switches, put on music or the television, and use the virtual concierge services activated by voice. Read more about voice technology. For those who are hearing impaired, you can implement smart mirrors and other smart technology with these kinds of guests in mind.\n1. Spacious and clutter-free\nSpaciousness is essential to provide adequate space for people in wheelchairs to move around the room freely. This also means that there shouldn\u2019t be any obstacles in their way like carpets or elements wheelchairs could get stuck on. Ideally, for better traction, the rooms should have hardwood floors. The same goes for the visually impaired, there shouldn\u2019t be any obstacles that might get in their way from moving around the room comfortably.\nThe best way to avoid possible hurdles is to have a room that is clutter-free with a simple layout, and minimal furniture to make it as easy as possible to navigate around the room.\n2. Automatic doors\nAutomatic doors are essential, especially for individuals in a wheelchair. There should be an automatic door when entering and exiting the room, and ideally, a power door assist as hotel room doors tend to be very heavy. When possible, automatic doors should also be in the entry to your hotel so that people can easily enter and exit the hotel without help. Learn more about lobby design.\n3. Adjustable beds\nWhether your guests need a hoyer lift or not to get into bed, it\u2019s important to have a bed with an adjustable height that can accommodate any kind of guest. This will also mean that you have the dimensions and height of the bed documented, so your staff is able to answer these important questions. Knowing this height, guests can more easily understand if they will be able to lift themselves into the bed or will need assistance.\nYou may also like:\n4. Roll-in shower and bars\nA roll-in shower means that the shower should be quite spacious without any steps or obstacles in the way, so people in wheelchairs can get in and out of the shower without any problems. The shower should also have a bench and bars in the shower and next to the toilet. The bathroom should have a panic button installed should they need help.\n5. Buzzer and light\nA buzzer and light are necessary for guests who are hearing impaired. The buzzer should be placed outside and a flashing light inside so that they know someone is at the door. The buzzer is also helpful for the visually impaired because they can hear when someone is at the door.\n6. Plugs\nWhile plugs should never be an obstacle for guests with disabilities, it\u2019s important that they are able to easily utilize the plugs, which should ideally be located between 15-48 inches (30-120 cm). The idea is to have the plugs more or less at waist height so that they can be easily reached. There should also be plugs on the desks, on the night stands and in the lamp bases.\n7. Suite set-up\nAs a hotelier it\u2019s important to have different types of rooms be accessible, that means that also suites are set up for people with disabilities, since they often travel with caregivers. These caregivers should be easily able to access the main room, but both parties should have privacy.\n8. Ability to remove items when necessary\nAs a hotelier you want your rooms to be decorated to perfection, However, in the case of accessible rooms, it\u2019s important that this decoration be flexible. That means that furniture can be easily moved or removed in order to accommodate your guests\u2019 needs. Excessive design elements that may get in the way, on the other hand, should be given extra thought if they really contribute or detract from the room\u2019s accessibility features.\nConclusion\nBy implementing these eight tips to make an accessible hotel room, you can be sure that your rooms will create an optimal guest experience by considering the needs of all your hotel guests. Make sure your front desk staff is trained on the different features of your accessible rooms so that they are prepared to answer any questions that come at them. Learn more about building the perfect hotel staff.\nYour staff should also be prepared to provide reasonable accommodations for guests with disabilities, like removing or moving furniture around, or relocating elements within the room to more accessible positions. The key to designing an accessible hotel room is a simple layout, minimal furniture, spaciousness and the ability to provide flexibility."}, {"title": "Accessibility vs. Accommodation", "article": "\"Accessibility\" is often presented as added steps you need to take so people with disabilities can access information using adaptive or assistive technologies.

But when you have a disability, it can be more challenging and stressful to go through the process. You may even worry so much that in the end, you may decide not to proceed with your trip as it is making you too anxious thinking about all the things that could potentially go wrong.\nHowever, planning your trip and arming yourself with the correct information is the best way to ensure a safe and smooth journey. In this guide to accessible travel, we will show you how to plan for every stage of your trip so that no matter what your disability is, you can ensure that you will have a more pleasant and stress-free journey.\nKnow Your Rights When Traveling\nAs one of the world\u2019s leading free countries, the USA has many acts in place that protect disabled people. Many of these apply to traveling, so it is important to make sure you know what your rights are as a disabled person.\nAir Carrier Access Act (ACAA)\nThe Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA) is equivalent to the ADA for airlines and has been in place since 1986. It protects disabled passengers and lays out legal guidelines for air companies to adhere to. The policy is enforced by USDOT (U.S. Department of Transportation) and ensures you are fully protected. However, due to this, you cannot take private action against an airline that doesn\u2019t follow the act and will need to go through the USDOT for assistance in the matter.\nIf you are traveling by air, the airline has a legal responsibility to ensure that their travel system is accessible to those with a disability. This can include but is by no means limited to the free carriage of mobility equipment such as your wheelchair as well as free carriage of any medical equipment or supplies. The airline must also offer complimentary carriage of assistance animals as well as providing wheelchair assistance for passengers who require this.\nThe airline staff should not expect you to travel with a companion except in the most extreme circumstances and should be on hand to offer assistance with various tasks such as help getting to the restroom and boarding the plane. The only time that you would be required to have a travel companion would be if you were unable to perform basic self-care tasks such as feeding yourself or if you would be unable to aid in your own evacuation, in the case of an emergency. You should not be, by law, refused service on an aircraft on the basis that you have a disability. Every service should be fully inclusive.\nPlanning Your Trip\nTraveling takes extensive planning at the best of times, but when you have a disability, this becomes even more important. Before you head off on your journey, be sure to put the right plans in place and have everything prepared; this is the best way to ensure a smooth trip.\nLet the Airline Know About Your Disability and Any Special Requirements\nOne of the best ways to ensure that airline staff are effectively able to provide you with the right assistance during your trip is to prepare them with the right information. When you book your ticket, there is usually an option to add any special requirements; use this to your advantage and provide as much information as possible. If there is not an option for this, you should contact the customer services department who will be able to take details of your requirements.\nYou can detail whether you have a handicap or whether you have an illness or medical condition, as well as offering information on the type of equipment you will need to bring with you. This might include but is not limited to portable oxygen containers (POCs), wheelchairs, or mobility scooters.\nAs well as discussing your needs with the airline prior to the flight, it is also important to make any necessary arrangements relating to special assistance. This might include bringing a service dog on board, the use of an oxygen container, or services to help with reduced mobility. While different airlines may have slightly different procedures for this, in general, you should be able to book services before flying.\nWhen booking, it is important to let the airline know about any special assistance that you require. The airline will use four-character Special Service Request (SSR) codes in order to arrange the necessary assistance that you may require at the airport or/and onboard the aircraft. A list of common SSR codes relating to different needs is shown in the below table:\nSSR Status Code Description of Assistance WCHR Wheelchair assistance is required to/from the aircraft (passenger can walk short distances and ascend/descend steps) WCHS Wheelchair assistance is required to/from the aircraft, and up & down the aircraft steps (passenger can walk short distances but not ascend/descend steps) WCHC Wheelchair assistance is required to/from the aircraft, and up and down the aircraft steps, as well as on/off the aircraft seat (passenger is unable to walk) BLND Passenger is blind or has vision impairments, and requires a walker through the airport to the aircraft seat BLDP Passenger is blind or has vision impairments, but does not require any assistance and can travel alone DEAF Passenger is deaf MASS Meet and assist WCBD Passenger is traveling with a powered wheelchair with a dry cell battery WCBW Passenger is traveling with a powered wheelchair with a wet cell battery WCMP Passenger is traveling with a manually powered wheelchair WCMB Passenger is traveling with a powered wheelchair with a lithium ion battery WCOB Passenger requires an on-board wheelchair provided by the airline PPOC Passenger is traveling with a portable oxygen concentrator AOXY Passenger requires airline supplied oxygen SVAN Passenger is traveling with a service dog ESAN Passenger is traveling with an emotional support dog\nAccording to the ACAA, the airline should allow you to transport your powerchair, wheelchair, POC, and any other pieces of equipment you need. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that there might not be restrictions on how the equipment is transported. For example, in the case of a powerchair or mobility scooter, you may be required to remove the batteries during the flight and transport them separately. These regulations may vary from one airline to another, so it is vital to check this before your trip. In addition, it can be helpful to know of any weight or size limits on equipment and speak to customer services regarding how you will transport things if it exceeds these limits.\nYou must also consider that any special equipment you require to take with you will likely fall outside of your typical luggage allowance. For this reason, we would highly recommend checking your luggage allowances before your flight and finding out what, if any, restrictions are in place. This is especially important for people who need to take more luggage than usual.\nWhen booking, we would also advise you to speak to the airline to reserve your seating. This will allow you to have priority for special seating that may include things like a moveable aisle armrest, an adjoining seat, or a bulkhead seat. You cannot hope to turn up at the airport on the day and expect that these seating options will be available as somebody else may have already reserved them. However, it is important to keep in mind that, as a disabled person, you have a right to preferential seating.\nAirlines may be at liberty to ask you to change your seat if they feel that this is the safest option. For example, if you are traveling with a service animal, the airline may ask you to move to a bulkhead seat to comply with FAA guidelines.\nThe final thing that you should ensure before traveling is to check whether there are any restrictions on what medication you are allowed to take in your hand luggage. As you may already be aware, there are limits on things like medications and liquids in hand luggage, in terms of quantity and size, so it is vital that you check what you are allowed to carry and how this must be done.\nChoose Your Hotel Carefully\nNot all hotel rooms are designed with accessibility in mind, and this is crucial to keep in mind when booking accommodation. One of the best ways to choose the best hotel room for your needs is to check out online reviews from other disabled guests who will give a reliable and truthful account of the hotel facilities.\nThere are travel agents that specialize in booking rooms that are suitable for disabled travelers, so you may consider hiring one of these people. However, you can also make plans yourself. It is possible to contact the hotel directly and ask what things they have in place to make your stay more convenient. If you use a wheelchair, you will need to find out whether there are ramps to give you easy access to the building and whether elevators are in place to reach the upper levels. If there are not, you will need to request a ground floor room.\nBut it isn\u2019t just getting to and from your room that may be an issue. Once inside the suite, you may find that it is difficult to navigate, so it is essential to check out the layout of the room before booking. Most hotels will have a selection of accessible rooms but these tend to be limited so booking in plenty of time will ensure you get a room that meets your needs.\nTIP: While many hotels claim to have accessible rooms, you should always check with the hotel\u2019s staff first before booking to ensure that it has all the accessible features that you may require, to make your stay comfortable. Ask for photographs or video footage of the rooms, so that you can check yourself to see if they are indeed accessible-friendly.\nBook Any Required Transport to and from the Airport\nFor passengers traveling by air, the plane journey is just one part of the trip. You will need to ensure that you can safely get to and from the airport. In order to make sure that you have the most appropriate form of transport, you should book this in advance. While you will find cabs and buses outside most global airports, not all of these will be equipped to transport disabled passengers.\nYou will need to ensure that the vehicle has enough room to transport any mobility aids or special equipment. You may also wish to let the company know if you are traveling with a service animal. Most companies won\u2019t have an issue with this and will allow your animal to travel free of charge.\nAfter making your booking, make a note of the telephone number of the company to take with you so that you can contact them if there are any problems on the day.\nEnsure That You Have Travel Insurance\nWe would advise anyone to take out appropriate travel insurance, but this becomes even more imperative when you are a disabled person, especially if you are traveling with mobility aids or medical equipment.\nWe suggest making travel insurance arrangements at the same time as booking your trip as this will give you greater peace of mind that everything is organized. When taking out a travel insurance policy, you will want to check that it covers any existing medical conditions or disabilities as well as covering your equipment. You should make sure that the policy covers you in the event that the airline cannot transport you, perhaps if the planned plane is out of commission and the replacement is not accessible. It is vital to ensure that the policy covers medical costs that are charged as a result of your disability or condition. This isn\u2019t something that is seen on all policies so always check this first.\nIn most cases, there will be a limit on the amount of cover you can claim, so be sure to check this before signing anything. This is very important in all cases but even more so if you own an expensive piece of equipment such as a powerchair.\nTIP: You should ensure that any travel health insurance that you take out, covers any pre-existing medical conditions, as well as possible medical emergencies. You should also check that it covers any expensive mobility aids that you will be taking with you, for loss or damage.\nA Month Before Your Trip\nOnce all of your travel plans are in place, you could be forgiven for thinking that you can sit back and relax. However, we would suggest making further plans as your trip draws closer to ensure that everything goes as smoothly as possible.\nBook an Appointment to See Your Doctor\nSeeing your doctor before your travel will give you the peace of mind that everything to do with your medical condition or disability is dealt with and that there will be no nasty surprises while you are away. For example, it will give you an opportunity to collect any spare medicines that you may need for your journey. When you are traveling, it is essential to make sure that you have more than enough medication and not just enough for the duration of the trip. In the event of a delay or an emergency, you will be rest assured that you won\u2019t run out.\nYour doctor will be able to pen a letter that details your disability or condition, which will come in handy should you require treatment during your trip. In addition to this, when you go through TSA security, a doctor\u2019s letter may provide you with fast-tracking where medical devices are being carried, which can take much of the stress out of the experience. You may also be expected to provide a medical certificate from your doctor stating that you are fit to travel. While this isn\u2019t something that all airlines require, many do, so you should check this before you book your appointment.\nTIP: Get a doctor\u2019s letter before your trip that provides detailed information about your disability or medical condition. This will not only prove useful if you need any medical treatment while you are away, but it can also help to speed up the security checks if you are carrying any medication or medical aids on you.\nA Week Before Your Trip\nAs your trip draws ever nearer, there are a few essential things to tick off your to-do list.\nCheck the Airport Layout\nMost airports will cater to the needs of those with disabilities. However, since each airport is different, it is important to check the layout of any airport you will be visiting. You will typically find that this information is available on the airport\u2019s website, where you will be able to find information on where wheelchair ramps are located and the location of accessible toilets.\nYou will also be able to find out details on suitable changing rooms and seating for disabled passengers. This information will better help you navigate the airport, so it is important to either print it out or have it saved to your mobile device for reference during the journey.\nMake a List of Any Essentials You Need to Take With You\nTraveling requires you to take a lot of personal belongings, and this may be even more when you have a medical condition or a disability. It is a good idea to make a list of everything you will need for your journey, most importantly, essential items. This could include your plans for the airport as well as travel documents like your passport, tickets, and hotel confirmation.\nYou will also need to include items such as your driver\u2019s license, a doctor\u2019s letter, any necessary medication, and contact numbers you may need. If you have any special equipment such as a wheelchair or any instruction manuals for your disability aids, you should include these on your list too.\n1-2 Days Before Your Trip\nMost of your travel plans will be made by now, but in the days before leaving, there are a few final preparations you will need to make.\nMake Sure You Have All Your Essentials Packed\nPack your luggage well in advance of leaving; the last thing you want to do is to leave it until the last minute and risk forgetting something. Using the list you made, add things to your bag and cross these off as you go.\nAirlines provide you with a certain baggage allowance. If this is exceeded, you may be charged to carry the additional weight. Once your bags are packed, weigh them to ensure that they are within the given parameters. Any mobility devices you use should be free of charge to transport but do keep in mind that you are only permitted to take two before there will be a charge.\nPack Any Medication That You May Require into Separates Bags\nIf you take any medication then it is a good ideal to split this across all of your luggage. If a bag gets lost, you will still have a supply of medication. We would always advise taking a little more than you need in the case of an emergency or delay.\nWhen placing the medication into your bag, be sure to put it somewhere that it is easily accessible such as a side pocket.\nMake Sure Any Medical Devices You Need To Take Are Easily Transportable\nIf you are taking any mobility devices on your trip, you should ensure that they are correctly stored by folding them and storing them in a transport bag. Of course, this only applies if you will not require the use of the device during the journey. Airlines require that disabled people use a manual wheelchair when on the flight, so your power chair will need to be stored in cargo. However, it is the responsibility of the airline to return the chair to you before you disembark.\nMobility scooter batteries will need to be removed for the flight and most airlines will require that the battery is stored in a special container. All batteries that are installed in mobility scooters or power chairs are non-spillable, meaning that they are safe to transport. However, if you are using a lithium ion battery, this will need to be transported in its own special case.\nWhen transporting your wheelchair, be sure to remove any parts that come away, such as bags, cushions, and wheels. You should also provide instructions on how to handle the chair for the airline staff. Items such as crutches, prosthetics, and walkers are considered to be assistive devices and are usually permitted for transportation within the cabin.\nContact the Airline\nYou may have spoken to the airline at the time of booking about your special requirements, but if not, now is a good time to contact them and let them know what you need. You will need to let them know if you are taking a service animal or any mobility equipment, as well as detailing what help you may need from the assistants at the airport gate.\nSome passengers may require a specific type of seating and the airline is required to provide you with this. However, it has to be available and so getting in touch in the days prior to the flight will help to ensure you are given priority. All airlines are required to follow FAA safety standards where seating is concerned and there are various options that may make the journey more comfortable for you, which include:\nSeats with a moveable armrest in the aisle for passengers who cannot transfer into a fixed armrest seat.\nThose traveling with a service animal may require a bulkhead seat.\nPeople with immobilized or fused legs may benefit from a seat with extra legroom.\nFor people who are traveling with a caregiver, adjoining seats may be available.\nWhile the airline is required to help passengers with disabilities, there are requirements on your part. Some airlines ask that you notify them of special requirements within 24 to 48 hours of flying, whereas others may need you to contact them 72 hours in advance. This is something you should always check.\nGetting to the Airport\nWhile the flight may be the main part of your journey, getting to the airport requires careful planning too\nGet to the Airport with Plenty of Time to Spare\nThe last thing you want is to feel rushed when you arrive at the airport, so be sure to get there with plenty of time to spare. We would recommend arriving at least three hours before your departure time. This will allow you lots of time to check-in, go through security, and board the flight. This additional time will also ensure that you aren\u2019t rushed when taking apart your mobility equipment and removing the battery.\nThe airline may require a little more time to make sure that all of your needs are met. If you have a staff member helping you with boarding, they are required to allow you a bathroom break and provide your service animal with a respite stop. Once you are ready to board, you are able to get on the plane ahead of other passengers, should you need to.\nAt the Airport\nGetting through the airport may feel like a mammoth task, but with some careful planning, things will go much more smoothly.\nChecking-In\nWhen you arrive at the check-in desk, you should inform the assistant of any special requirements you have and let them know that you have contacted the airline in advance. In many cases, airlines will have already arranged for someone to meet and assist you, but if not, the check-in desk will arrange this at the time.\nYou should check any medical equipment or luggage that won\u2019t be needed on the plane but ensure you keep any medication with you. If you are using a wheelchair, you can take this to the gate, but if it is a power chair, you won\u2019t be able to take it into the cabin.\nTIP: If you are taking medical or mobility equipment, take the corresponding operating manuals in your hand luggage with you. The airline may require additional information about these devices, so this can help to speed up the check-in process.\nSecurity Check-In\nDisabled passengers may be eligible to sign up as a TSA Precheck member, which provides you with a 5-year membership to make security checks much easier. Members are not required to remove their shoes, nor do they need to remove things like belts, light jackets, or laptops. You will also not be required to have a security pat-down which some disabled people may find invasive. In most cases, this fast-track service will see you through security in 5 minutes or less and is available at more than 200 US airports.\nIf you have a doctor\u2019s note with you, you should show this to the TSA staff to demonstrate that you do require any mobility devices you have with you. This is imperative to prevent delays during the security checks.\nBoarding the Plane\nWhile you will not be able to take a power chair into the cabin, you are permitted to use this right up to the departure gate. At this point, the airline staff will transport it to the cargo hold. However, if you are unable to board the plane without a wheelchair, the airline will provide you with one for transfer. In some cases, a lift may be used to further assist with boarding.\nIn some airports, the plane may not be directly located outside of the gate, in which case, you will be required to board a shuttle bus. Again, airline staff will be happy to assist you, simply communicate your needs at the gate.\nIt is possible to pre-board the plane, and this allows you more space and time to get comfortable as well as giving you the benefit of choosing the most appropriate seating. Airlines have specially trained staff who will be able to provide you with the correct assistance, but once again, it is essential to communicate your needs.\nOn the Plane\nThere is a legal requirement that all planes with a passenger capacity of more than 60, must have an accessible bathroom. However, if you are not on a plane with an accessible bathroom, it may be worth selecting a seat close to the lavatory. While staff can provide you with assistance getting to the bathroom, they cannot help you whilst inside.\nYou should keep in mind that airline staff are there to help you with stowing your luggage in the overhead lockers. Even if you previously stated that assistance is not required, you can ask for help at any time. However, if you realize mid-flight that you may need help when the plane lands, it is a good idea to notify staff before the descent.\nAt Your Destination\nOnce the plane lands, you may require assistance disembarking and getting out of the airport. Staff are there to help you, so be sure to be aware of what is on offer to you.\nWait for Assistance\nIf you have notified the cabin crew during the flight that you require assistance upon landing, allow them time to come to you and provide this. If English is not your first language or if you have problems communicating, then it can be a good idea to have written details of your requirements to allow staff to help you more easily.\nCheck the Condition of Your Mobility Device\nWhile most airlines will take great care to look after your mobility equipment, there may be times that damage occurs. Before leaving the airport, we would strongly suggest that you check over the device for signs of damage that were not previously there (it can be helpful to take photos before departing so that you can prove any damage).\nIf you do notice anything, you are within your rights to file a claim to cover the cost of the repairs.\nTIP: Take photographic evidence of any mobility aids you\u2019re taking with you before your trip. In the event the airline damages or loses any of these devices, you will have a much stronger case when claiming for compensation.\nFlying With a Service Dog\nThe ACAA does not only see dogs as being a service animal. They will accept any animal provided that it has been trained to provide assistance in a physical or emotional capacity. However, keep in mind that the ADA does not define service animals in the same way.\nAirlines are required to accommodate service animals within reason but there are limitations on this. For example, if the dog is too large to be safely transported or if it poses a safety risk to other passengers. Dogs that cause too much disruption may be denied travel. The airline will view the behavior of the animal and check for obvious signs that it is a service animal."}, {"title": "TSA Cares: What to expect when traveling with a mobility aid", "article": "Are you or someone you know traveling using a wheelchair or mobility aid?

The safe and efficient transport of mobility aids was identified as a key area for improvement by airlines, working with industry stakeholders and disability groups.\n\u201cAirlines are committed to ensuring passengers with disabilities can travel with dignity, confidence and comfort. Working with representatives from the disability community, we established that new protocols to improve the transport of mobility aids were urgently required. This new guidance, created in partnership with key players in the travel chain, will improve service, and significantly reduce damage to these vital devices that are often an extension to the body of a passenger with a disability,\u201d said Nick Careen, IATA\u2019s Senior Vice President for Operations, Safety and Security.\nKey elements of the new guidance include:\nBetter processes for booking and information exchange, including the use of Special Service Request (SSR) and Passenger Name Requirement (PNR) codes to give advance information on the specifications of mobility aids\nA recommendation to create an electronic mobility aid tag, fixed to the mobility aid and containing technical information which will help airlines and ground handlers transport the aid safely\nAdvice to airlines on developing a communications toolkit for engaging with passengers with disabilities, including a clearly signposted and accessible website area.\nBest practices for loading, collection and return of mobility aids\nA recommendation for dedicated specialized ramp personnel to be trained and deployed to handle mobility aids\nGuidance for how to properly resolve instances where mobility aids are damaged\nRevised and enhanced training of ground handlers and airline staff\n\u201cExperience shows that communication is key to improving the handling of mobility aids. This guidance sets out steps for passengers, airlines, and the travel chain to exchange information at every stage of the travel journey. It will help airlines perform better and give passengers using mobility aids greater confidence. We\u2019ll be working with our members and stakeholders to operationalize this guidance, and the industry will be reaching out to policymakers to encourage harmonization with national regulations,\u201d said Careen.\nThe guidance reflects and builds on industry best practices and will continue to be revised and expanded prior to developing into industry standards. Other aspects include recommendations for airport designs to meet accessibility standards, as well as specific guidance to ensure compliance with the Dangerous Goods Regulations (for lithium-battery powered devices), in addition to step-by-step instructions on safely and securely loading mobility aids on board.\n> Access IATA Guidance on the Transport of Mobility Aids (pdf)\nFor more information, please contact:\nCorporate Communications\nTel: +41 22 770 2967\nEmail: corpcomms@iata.org\nNotes for Editors:"}, {"title": null, "article": null}, {"title": null, "article": null}, {"title": "16 tips to make travelling with a disability easier", "article": "Travelling as a disabled person is never straightforward.

Check your travel insurance\nFrustratingly, travel insurance costs more simply because you have a disability \u2014 but it\u2019s very important to get the right cover; listing long-term medical conditions and chronic illnesses will save you a fortune if you need medical attention on holiday. Remember that additional insurance to protect mobility aids may also be needed. Shop around for your insurance, a comparison website can show you the best deal depending on how much assistance you need.\n2. Pack enough medication\nAnd check that you can take it into the country you\u2019re visiting. Remembering your medication could be the difference between a good break away and a bad one. Cut down your chances of losing medication when you travel by packing it in separate bags \u2014 one lot in your suitcase, one lot in your hand luggage \u2014 it will mean you\u2019ve always got some to hand no matter what.\nSome countries limit how much of certain types of medication you can carry on one person at one time; strong painkillers are often restricted so get a dispensation letter from your doctor if you need one.\n3. Check with your GP for any extra immunisations\nWe all need jabs when we go to certain destinations but, with particular health conditions, you may need more. It\u2019s definitely worth booking an appointment with your GP or registered nurse to make sure you\u2019re covered.\nHollie-Anne Brooks in Paris\n4. Check you\u2019re fit to fly\nYour GP should also help check that you\u2019re fit to fly. Don\u2019t forget any extras you may need to take with you such as compression socks, spare feeding tubes or masks.\n5. Get a free (or discounted) space for your carer or PA\nTravelling often means having to take a personal assistant with you and if you need multiple carers this can soon add up. Thankfully, you can get discounts \u2014 and often get free spaces. Eurostar, for example, only has wheelchair spaces in standard premier or business class but you will get these at the price of standard tickets; this includes one seat at standard price for your carer too.\n6. Remember all your mobility aids\nMany of us use different mobility aids for different days. If you\u2019re an ambulatory wheelchair user, are you also going to need to take a walking stick with you? Do you need different mobility aids to cover all terrains you might experience on your trip?\nAn airport lift for passengers who use wheelchairs (Getty Images)\n7. Familiarise yourself with the procedure for checking-in mobility aids\nDon\u2019t panic about being without your wheels when flying. Your wheelchair will be stored with the luggage and you\u2019ll be given another to transport you around airports at either end and to and from your seat. If your personal wheelchair or mobility aid comes with specialist storage instructions or needs to be handled in a certain way, make sure the airline knows and you know where, when and how your mobility aid will be returned to you.\n8. Use websites like AccessAble to plan your trip\nAccessAble provides full reviews and information about everything from where the accessible public toilets are in a city to which hotels offer accessible spa access. Plan ahead, including where you are going to eat, and make sure any companies you book through are aware of your access needs and have ramps, working lifts, braille menus and anything else you may require.\nEuan\u2019s Guide provides similar reviews and allows disabled people to leave reviews of different aspects of their visit to certain attractions, so you can get a first-hand account of what you\u2019re about to experience.\n9. Use a specialist travel agents\nSome travel agents, such as Travel Counsellors, specialise in creating incredible accessible travel experiences. If you\u2019re unsure where to even begin, use a specialist agency who can cover everything for you from booking your transfers to and from the hotel to whether the swimming pool has a hoist to which spas have wheelchair accessible treatment rooms.\n10. Consider renting a mobility device\nMany hotels, museums, cruise ships and holiday resorts have mobility scooters and wheelchairs that you can often rent free of charge or for a small fee. Airport assistance will be able to transport you around the airport in a wheelchair or on a buggy and, once you arrive at your destination, check out the range of mobility aids on offer to help get you round the resort.\nMake sure your hotel room has space for your service animal to work, rest and play (Alamy)\n11. Make sure your accommodation has enough room for your service animal\nIf you\u2019re travelling with a service animal, such as a guide dog, make sure the hotel room you\u2019re provided with has enough room for your animal to work, rest and play. Look for hotels with large grounds so you can walk your animal and know your rights \u2014 it is illegal for anyone in the UK to turn away someone with a guide dog, whether that be when entering a taxi or going to a restaurant.\n12. Take an extension lead\nA multi-plug extension lead will become your best friend on holiday; if you\u2019ve got an electric wheelchair to charge and other pieces of equipment that require electricity then the one plug socket that\u2019s not by the bed isn\u2019t going to help. Take an extension lead so you can plug your equipment into multiple holes and have the power connected right next to where you need it.\nSee our pick of the best hotels with accessible rooms\nWhile you\u2019re there\n13. Pace yourself\nIt can be tempting to take part in a tonne of activities, visit all the museums and galleries and spend the night working your way through the cocktail menu but it\u2019s important to remember to pace yourself to keep your health in its best shape for as long as possible.\n14. Embrace train and airport lounges\nOn Eurostar, for example, all disabled people can use the business lounge whether you\u2019re travelling business class or not. I like to use this time to familiarise myself with my itinerary, as well as enjoy the perks such as free snacks, wine and beer.\n15. Use your blue badge\nWe may not be in the EU anymore but your blue badge for parking that you use in the UK is still valid across the EU. Outside of the EU, different rules apply so make sure to check the country\u2019s driving and parking rules ahead of time to avoid a potential fine.\n16. Check foreign public transport\nNot all transport abroad will be as equipped for disabled people as what we\u2019re used to in the UK. Check to see if you need to book assistance or make any other amendments.\nWhere can I travel without a vaccine?"}, {"title": null, "article": null}]
