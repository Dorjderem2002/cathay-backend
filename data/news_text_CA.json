In 2016, she founded Planet Abled, a travel company that caters to the needs of people with various disabilities, a group the World Health Organization estimates at 15 percent of the world\u2019s population. Arora isn\u2019t the only one pushing for more thoughtful travel experiences\u2014here\u2019s a look at six companies focused on accessible travel.\nTravel for All\nTravel for All has organized more than 5,000 vacations around the world for travelers with a variety of requirements, including cane users, slow walkers, hearing and vision impaired persons, travelers with complex health issues like dialysis and developmental disabilities, and wheelchair users. \u201cAs multiple sclerosis began to affect my own personal travel, I researched what resources could assist me with executing travel using my wheelchair,\u201d says CEO Tarita Davenock. \u201cI was shocked when I saw the lack of services.\u201d Every trip Travel for All plans comes with an accessibility specialist. \u201cWe research and give our clients the pros and cons of any area in the world before planning the trip, so our client knows what to expect while they are in that destination,\u201d says Davenock. \u201cMeticulous planning and great attention to detail are the keystones of keeping our vacations safe.\u201d\nA Seable group trip in Cambodia, where travelers visited the Wat Phnom temple Courtesy Seable Holidays\nSeable Holidays\nSeable Holidays specializes in trips for visually impaired travelers. All trips include trained chaperones\u2014who undergo a background check\u2014as well as inclusive sports and sensory activities like horse riding, scuba diving, kayaking, wine tasting, yoga, and tactile museum excursions. And everything is thoroughly vetted, with chaperones, activities, and accommodations tested by blind people before they\u2019re recommended by the company. While trips are on pause during the pandemic, Seable Holidays will bring them back in summer 2022.\nEasy Access Travel\nDebra Kerper and her team at Easy Access Travel accommodate most types of physical disabilities in their solo trips and mixed group tours. While Kerper sometimes relies on her own experiences as a traveler in a wheelchair, she says every trip needs to be tailored to an individual client\u2019s needs. To do so, the team spends time getting to know their clients to match them with the best vacation choice, and visits hotels and tourist spots for inspection, takes cruises beforehand, and collects information from trustworthy sources to ensure a safe, accessible, and fun experience.\nPlanet Abled\nNeha Arora\u2019s Planet Abled arranges customized tours for people with different types of disabilities, and also plans group tours that include non-disabled people. Their trips mostly take place in India and South East Asia, with plans to expand to countries in Europe, and popular activities include river rafting, skiing, trekking, and wildlife safaris. Some of their extra touches include assigning a travel buddy for the blind, seeking special permission from museums so clients can touch and feel the articles on display, and arranging for sign language interpreters for the hearing impaired.\nWheel the World\nAlvaro Silberstein, the CEO of Wheel the World, was paralyzed from the chest down after surviving an accident at 18.

Most of his clients are adults or seniors with mobility disabilities and wheelchair users, and he can arrange solo travel or group trips. Silberstein wants to create more awareness around accessibility, and his company pays special attention to details like the height of beds, width of doors, and accessibility of bathrooms, compiling this information on the Wheel the World website. Their multi-day trips are designed with local tour operators with a focus on accessible travel, and includes access to adaptive bikes, beach wheelchairs, and equipment for hiking, skydiving, kayaking, scuba diving, and surfing\u2014they\u2019ve even planned Macchu Pichu trips for wheelchair users.

It begins with some things to consider as you select your carrier.\nYou'll find suggestions about how to make your reservations, either directly with the carrier, through your travel agent or online. We have also created a reservation checklist (Annex A: Reservation Checklist for Persons With Disabilities: A Step-by-step Guide for Planning Your Travel) that you can use to itemize your travel needs and facilitate a discussion with your travel agent or carrier.\nThen we move on to look at your journey from start to finish. First, we'll talk about the terminal, then about getting on board. We'll describe some issues that can arise along the way, and how to plan ahead for your arrival at the other end. We'll also provide you with some advice about what to do when things don't turn out as you expected.\nBroadly speaking, the CTA can provide you with accessibility-related guidance about travel on airplanes within Canada and internationally when travelling to/from Canada and accessing airports located in Canada, as well as on trains, ferries and buses that cross provincial/territorial borders or the Canadian border and accessing the terminals located in Canada that serve them. The CTA can also provide you with accessibility-related guidance concerning the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA) and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA).\nYour preparations will make your travel easier and more enjoyable. Here are three useful steps:\nIt is always a good idea to plan your trip ahead of time and know how to get help if you need it along the way. By planning early, you can get more information about your options and ensure that the carrier has enough time to provide the services you need.\nAs a traveller with a disability, you should not face barriers when you travel.\nIt often pays to shop around. Canada's transportation system is complex, with a wide range of transportation service providers varying in size and resources. This means that services vary and some may not be available everywhere. While all carriers are required to meet the needs of travellers with disabilities to the greatest extent possible, some may be better equipped than others to meet your specific needs. Ask questions. Compare answers. You'll get more control over your journey.\nIt\u2019s always a good idea to gather information about your trip well before you go. Use your travel agent or the carrier as resources. Carrier websites and customer service staff can answer questions about the accessibility services that are available and what might meet your needs. If you need information in an alternative format, let your carrier know which format you require. For example, if the information is only available in paper format, let them know whether you would like a version in large print, Braille or in an electronic format. Larger service providers are also required to ensure that if information is made available in an electronic format, the format is compatible with adaptive technology that is intended to assist persons with disabilities and, if information is made available in an audio format, it is made available in a visual format upon request by a person with a disability (and vice versa). For more information, see the CTA's Communication with Persons with Disabilities: A Guide .\nYou can find the ATPDR and associated guides, the regulations regarding training and air services, the codes of practice and guidelines on our website . Alternatively, you can contact us at the coordinates provided at the end of this guide.\nThe ATPDR are an important tool for making sure travel is accessible. However, transportation service providers not covered by the ATPDR are still required to provide accessible services. The CTA is considering whether and how to extend ATPDR requirements to the smaller transportation service providers not currently covered. In the meantime, the CTA expects smaller transportation service providers to comply with the following standards:\nThe ATPDR apply to large carriers and terminals in modes of transport under federal jurisdiction \u2013 all air services, as well as most rail, bus, and ferry services that transport passengers across provincial/territorial or international borders \u2013 as well as the CBSA and the CATSA. Many ATPDR requirements apply only to Canadian transportation service providers, while some apply to both Canadian and foreign transportation service providers. For more information on the application of the ATPDR, see the CTA's Accessible transportation \u2013 Transportation service providers covered by the Accessible Transportation for Persons with Disabilities Regulations: A Guide .\nThe Accessible Transportation for Persons with Disabilities Regulations (ATPDR) provide a set of clear, consistent, specific and legally binding accessibility requirements for transportation service providers. The regulations are comprehensive and cover communication and personnel training; service and technical requirements for carriers and terminal operators; and requirements for the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA) and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA).\nTravelling outside Canada\nASL version of Travelling outside Canada This is an American Sign Language (ASL) video with no audio Continue to the next video: Take charge through your plan\nOur tips can also help you if you travel outside the country. Remember, though, that Canadian standards and rules generally don't apply in other countries (although the CTA has sometimes extended some Canadian standards and rules to Canadian carriers when they operate outside Canada). In some places, travel is very accessible, but in many other places, it is not.\nA reminder: While a passport is an essential document for international travel, you may also need additional documents such as a visa, health certificate and/or proof of vaccination. If you are bringing any medication, ask about how it will be handled at security checkpoints. It is always a good idea to carry your medication in your carry-on luggage so it is within reach during travel or in the event of a flight delay or if your baggage is delayed or lost.\nIf you use a service dog, it is always advisable to ask ahead about what the rules and restrictions related to travel with a service dog are, including any quarantine or permit requirements that might apply in your destination country. It is also advisable to ask whether an international health certificate and/or proof of vaccination for your dog are required and to keep the required documentation for your service dog with you at all times while visiting foreign countries.\nIf you are planning on taking an international flight and bringing a mobility aid, your airline is required to offer you the opportunity to make a special declaration of interest for your aid. This declaration allows you to reflect the monetary value and a description of your mobility aid in case it is damaged, destroyed, lost or not returned to you within the usual time frame at your destination. A special declaration of interest is important because, without it, international instruments cap the carriers' limits of liability to a level far less than the value of most mobility aids. The impact of this is that, if an aid is lost, damaged or destroyed during a trip and the traveller has not completed a special declaration of interest, they may only be entitled to reimbursement for a portion of the value of the aid. You can find out more about this on your airline's website.\nNote: Some products sold over the counter in Canadian pharmacies require prescriptions in other countries, including the United States. You may not be able to bring your medication into another country without a prescription.\nAsk before you go what you can and cannot take with you. For example, there may be restrictions on the types of oxygen devices that are permitted and on the number and types of batteries for mobility aids. There may also be restrictions on the types of emotional support animals that you can travel with and conditions on how they are transported. Look for information from your travel agency, carrier, government of the country you will be visiting, travel publications, and websites.\nTake charge through your plan ASL version of Take charge through your plan This is an American Sign Language (ASL) video with no audio Continue to the next video: Advance notice and information and documents to support a service request From the information you have gathered, it\u2019s time to build your travel plan and book it, either through your travel agent or directly with the carrier, either by phone or online. When you make your reservation directly with the carrier, mention your disability and explain your accessibility needs. Ask your carrier about the services and equipment they provide that will meet your needs. You can also check their website for information. If your reservation is made through a travel agent or other third party, such as an online company that allows you to research and book travel, it is always a good idea to contact your carrier directly to confirm that your accessibility needs have been correctly communicated and that the carrier is aware of the services you require to meet your needs.\nAdvance notice and information and documents to support a service request ASL version of Advance notice and information and documents to support a service request This is an American Sign Language (ASL) video with no audio Continue to the next video: Making arrangements to receive help If you need any accessibility services from your carrier, it is recommended that you give them as much notice as possible. While in some cases, no advance notice is required, carriers are required to arrange most services for you when you give them at least 48 hours\u2019 notice. With less than 48 hours\u2019 notice, they must make every reasonable effort to do so. If a carrier requires you to provide information or documents (for example, a medical certificate) to assess your service requests, up to 96 hours advance notice may be required. Note: If you provide advance notice but the notice period includes weekend or holiday days, your carrier may not be able to complete its assessment of your service request and, for that reason, may not be required to provide the service. It\u2019s therefore important that you make every effort to ensure that the advance notice includes at least two full business days. Usually you do not have to provide information or documentation to support your service request. However, in some cases, such as when a traveller uses a mobility aid or an assistive device (for example, a portable oxygen concentrator), carriers may require information (for example, the weight and dimensions of the mobility aid) or documents (for example, a medical certificate regarding the need for medical oxygen during travel). Carriers may also want a traveller's health professional to talk to its medical staff to clarify the traveller's service needs and ensure they are in a position to meet them. Be clear on exactly what your service needs are and ask about the services you can get. Note: If your carrier requests information or documents to support your service request, the carrier must offer to retain an electronic copy for at least three years. This will avoid you having to provide the same information or documents each time you travel with the carrier. For more information on advance notice and supporting information and documentation, see the CTA's Advance Notice/Supporting Documentation Requesting Services for Persons with Disabilities: A Guide.\nMaking arrangements to receive help ASL version of Making arrangements to receive help This is an American Sign Language (ASL) video with no audio Continue to the next video: Seats and cabins You can arrange to receive help throughout your journey, including: moving to/from a pick-up/drop-off area (curbside zone) of a terminal located in Canada;\nchecking in;\nmoving through the terminal, including through the security screening checkpoint;\nboarding, connecting, and disembarking;\nstoring and retrieving baggage;\nmoving to/from an on-board washroom;\nmoving through the terminal's border clearance area; and\nobtaining accessible ground transportation from your destination terminal in Canada. You should note that carriers are not required to provide assistance \u2014 or are only required to provide limited assistance \u2014 with: eating, taking medication, using the washroom;\ntransferring to/from a passenger seat after departure and before arrival;\norientation or communication; or\nphysical assistance in the event of an emergency, including in the case of an evacuation or decompression. If you need this help, ask your carrier about travelling with a support person. The assistance provided by a support person is in addition to the assistance that the carrier is already required to provide to passengers with disabilities, which includes, for example, assisting the passenger with meals served by the carrier by opening packages, identifying food items and their location and cutting large food portions; assistance with boarding/disembarking, storing and retrieving carry-on baggage, and describing the layout of an aircraft, train, ferry or bus and the location of onboard amenities; or transferring the passenger between a mobility aid and their passenger seat before departure and after arrival. A Canadian carrier must provide the adjacent seating for a necessary support person without charging you an additional fare or any other charges if you are travelling within Canada, except if that travel is part of an itinerary which includes travel outside Canada (for example, domestic legs of international flights). Note: Your carrier is required to provide you with written confirmation about the accessibility services you will receive. This will help you to verify arrangements before you leave and again along the way. You will also have to plan how you will get from home to the terminal and from the terminal to your final destination. In larger communities, there is a variety of accessible transportation available, from taxis and buses to rental cars. Smaller communities may have fewer choices. You may need to reserve ahead of time to make sure your ride is available to get you from point A to point B. Canadian terminal operators that have arrangements with ground transportation companies, must ensure that transportation from their terminals is accessible (see On arrival below).\nSeats and cabins ASL version of Seats and cabins This is an American Sign Language (ASL) video with no audio Continue to the next video: Allergy buffer zones Let your carrier know what your needs are for your seat or cabin. Based on the class of service that you have requested, your carrier must let you know what seats or cabins are available and have the equipment and facilities that would best meet your accessibility needs. Provide feedback to your carrier as it must consider your opinion before assigning you a seat or cabin. Carriers cannot charge seat selection fees for accessible seating. Note: If you wish to reserve specific accessible seating, you should make your request with your carrier well in advance of travel. Providing a carrier with adequate advance notice about the need for such seating will allow it to ensure that the seating is provided and, if necessary, make changes to seats that have already been assigned. In addition, if the seat that you wish to reserve is in an emergency exit row, there are regulatory requirements related to safety that must be met and the carrier may have to assess your capacity and capabilities to meet those requirements before permitting you to sit in such a seat. A Canadian carrier must provide that additional seating at no additional charge for travel between points in Canada if you require additional adjacent seating to accommodate your disability, for example: for a support person to provide you with assistance during travel that your carrier does not provide;\nfor your service dog because the floor space at your seat is insufficient; or\nif the nature of your disability is such that the limitation to a single seat would be a barrier to travel; for example, if you have a fused leg or a leg brace, or you are functionally disabled by obesity. For international travel \u2014 including any portion of the itinerary that is for travel between points in Canada \u2014 carriers are required to provide additional adjacent seating but are permitted to charge the fare. Note: for more information on additional seating, see the CTA's guides: Additional seating and the One Person, One Fare requirement for domestic travel: A Guide and Space for Service Dogs onboard transportation equipment: A Guide. You should be aware that your carrier may ask you to provide information or documents, including a medical certificate, to support your request for additional seating. Some carriers have a policy on who can be a support person so it's a good idea to ask about this ahead of time (for example, is there a minimum age or does the support person need to be physically capable of lifting the traveller with a disability or helping them to evacuate). If your support person does not meet the carrier's age requirement, but you believe that they are physically and otherwise capable of fulfilling all of the duties, you may wish to ask the carrier to make an individual assessment of your intended support person's capacity and capabilities.\nAllergy buffer zones ASL version of Allergy buffer zones This is an American Sign Language (ASL) video with no audio Continue to the next video: Mobility aids and assistive devices If you have a severe allergy, let your carrier know well in advance of your travel but, at a minimum, 48 hours before your departure. You can ask your carrier to establish a buffer zone around your seat. This means that: you will be seated in a bank of seats where the allergen is not located and that does not face a bank of seats where the allergen is located; and\nother passengers sitting in your bank of seats will be notified that there is a passenger with a severe allergy (without identifying you). They will also be told what you are allergic to so that they don't consume or use products that could trigger your allergy. You can also ask to pre-board and clean your seat to remove potential allergens. You should be aware that: there may be restrictions imposed by the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority on the types of cleaning supplies that can be brought onboard in carry-on baggage; or\nyour carrier may have a policy of providing the cleaning supplies themselves. It is important that you bring any allergy medications that you might use, such as epinephrine auto-injectors and other prescription and non-prescription medications, in your carry-on luggage and make sure that you can quickly access them. You may also want to bring your own food onboard if you have a food allergy. Note: You may be asked to provide supporting information or documents, including a medical certificate. For more information on travelling with a severe allergy, see the CTA's Severe Allergies: A Guide.\nMobility aids and assistive devices ASL version of Mobility aids and assistive devices This is an American Sign Language (ASL) video with no audio Continue to the next video: Arranging ground transportation Your carrier is required to transport your mobility aid except in the following circumstances: if the weight of your mobility aid exceeds the capacity of the device used for boarding mobility aids. This could also happen if you need to remain in your mobility aid during boarding, for example when boarding a train or bus.\nif your mobility aid does not fit on the transportation equipment (for example, in the baggage compartment). If that happens, the carrier must tell you about alternative trips to your destination which can accommodate your mobility aid and offer to book this at the lesser of the fare for your original trip and the fare for the alternative trip. You can find information on the maximum weight and dimensions of mobility aids that a carrier can transport on its website.\nif you are travelling by air and transporting your mobility aid would jeopardize the safe operation of the airplane. You should be aware that your carrier may ask you to provide written instructions for the disassembly/reassembly of your mobility aid if this is needed in order to store your aid during travel. When you plan your trip, ask the following questions: Do I have to store my mobility aid during travel and, if so, when do I have to transfer out of my aid (at check-in or at the boarding gate/platform)?\nCan mobility aids be stored on board, or must they be carried in cargo/baggage compartments? Be prepared to provide the weight and measurements of your mobility aid.\nIs there an on-board wheelchair?\nCan the on-board wheelchair get in and out of the washroom?\nWhich seats will be the most accessible for me (for example: seats with moveable armrests that facilitate transferring to/from an on-board wheelchair)? Note: Ask your carrier whether you can remain in your mobility aid during travel. Ferries are generally large enough for this purpose, while new or modified trains and buses (with some exceptions) are required to have spaces for this purpose. If this is not possible, you may want to ask where your mobility aid will be stored during travel. A train, and each deck of a ferry, must be able to store at least 1 mobility aid. Where possible, an airplane or bus must permit the storage of a walker or manual folding wheelchair in the cabin. Common assistive devices include a cane, crutches, a communication device (for example, a speech-generating device which translates typed messages into digitized speech), an orthotic positioning device (used to support and position a person who has postural problems), and a portable oxygen concentrator. If you need to use an assistive device while on board, your carrier is required to allow you to do this provided it is safe to do so. You should provide your reservation agent with information about your device, including whether it uses batteries or needs an onboard power supply. You may be asked to provide information or documents, including a medical certificate, regarding your use of the assistive device. Note: Airlines have rules about the onboard use of oxygen. You can find information on their policies, including whether they provide an oxygen service or require the use of a portable oxygen concentrator instead, by contacting the carrier. For more information on travelling with a mobility aid or assistive device, see the CTA's Travelling with mobility aids and other assistive devices: A Guide.\nArranging ground transportation ASL version of Arranging ground transportation This is an American Sign Language (ASL) video with no audio Continue to the next video: Service dogs If you need ground transportation to/from the terminal, you might want to arrange this in advance. See the section on ground transportation in On arrival below.\nService dogs ASL version of Service dogs This is an American Sign Language (ASL) video with no audio Continue to the next video: The Terminal Your carrier will usually require confirmation that your service dog has been trained for its role. It may do this when you make your reservation by asking you to provide a declaration attesting that your dog has been individually trained by an organization or person specializing in service dog training to perform a task to assist you with a need related to your disability. Your carrier may also require you to provide, before departure, an identification card or other document that is issued by such an organization or person and that identifies you and provides this same attestation. Note: If you are unable to provide a copy of an identification card or other document in support of your service dog's training when you contact your carrier to make a reservation \u2013 for example, because you do not have access to a computer to send an electronic copy \u2013 you can ask your carrier whether you can make a verbal declaration and follow up with a copy of the required document. Your carrier must ensure that there is enough floor space for your service dog to remain at your feet in a manner that ensures the well-being and safety of both you and your dog. You should provide your carrier with relevant information on your physical characteristics \u2014 such as long legs or the inability to bend a knee \u2014 and the size and other characteristics of your dog \u2013 such as its ability to maintain a curled position. In some cases, obstructions in the floor space will necessitate the use of floor space at an adjacent seat to ensure that you and your service dog can share the space safely and in reasonable comfort. If this is not possible because your dog is too large, your carrier must provide adjacent seating to provide sufficient floor space. The only exception is if you are travelling on a ferry that does not offer assigned seating. A Canadian carrier must provide the adjacent seating without charging you an additional fare or any other charges if you are travelling within Canada. For more information on travelling with a service dog, see the CTA's Service Dogs: A Guide and Space for Service Dogs onboard transportation equipment: A Guide.\nThe terminal ASL version of The terminal This is an American Sign Language (ASL) video with no audio Continue to the next video: Getting information about the terminal It's time to go! It is essential for you to be aware of your carrier's check-in time to give yourself enough time to both get to the terminal and receive assistance to check in, drop any baggage and get through the terminal to the gate, including transferring to a boarding chair if you are travelling with your own mobility aid. Also, you should be aware that the carrier may require you to arrive at the terminal earlier than the regular check-in time to receive certain types of assistance. The carrier may also provide check-in and boarding gate cut off times that must be respected regardless of lineups at check-in and security.\nGetting information about the terminal ASL version of Getting information about the terminal This is an American Sign Language (ASL) video with no audio Continue to the next video: Curbside assistance when you arrive at the terminal Many terminals publish maps of their interiors on their websites so you can chart your own course ahead of time. Canadian terminals are also required to publish on their websites information on the following: where the drop-off/pick-up area (curbside zone) is located and how to request assistance to/from it;\naccessible ground transportation from the terminal;\nthe location of service dog relief areas;\naccessible transportation between terminal buildings; and\nwheelchair and electric cart services. Inside larger terminals, you will probably find a help desk near the entrance where you can get information and help. Some terminals have automated information kiosks, which must be accessible to persons with disabilities in Canada.\nCurbside assistance when you arrive at the terminal ASL version of Curbside assistance when you arrive at the terminal This is an American Sign Language (ASL) video with no audio Continue to the next video: Moving through the terminal In Canada, terminal operators are required to provide you with curbside assistance. This will help you proceed from the curbside zone to the check-in area or, if there is no check-in area, to a representative of the carrier. Terminal operators are also required to provide you with assistance with your baggage, provide a wheelchair if you need one or help you with your own wheelchair, or provide you with guiding assistance if, for example, you are blind. There are different ways to obtain curbside assistance (for example, using a telephone or buzzer system located outside the terminal) and you may have to arrive at the terminal at a particular time in advance to receive the service. You should find out: how to request curbside assistance at the terminal;\nhow early to arrive at the terminal to receive the assistance; and\nwhere the terminal's drop-off and pick-up points for curbside assistance are. It is important for you to tell the terminal operator what kind of curbside assistance you need so you get the right kind of help and avoid, for example, getting a wheelchair when what you really need is guiding assistance. Note: Sometimes a carrier provides curbside assistance instead of the terminal operator. Your terminal operator will let you know if this is the case. Also, at bus stops, the bus operator must help you when disembarking to move between the bus and an area at the stop where you can wait. For more information, see the CTA's Curbside Assistance: A Guide.\nMoving through the terminal ASL version of Moving through the terminal This is an American Sign Language (ASL) video with no audio Continue to the next video: Checking in Getting from the carrier's check-in counter to the boarding area can be a voyage in itself. Boarding areas may be far away. Many terminals publish maps of their interiors on their websites so you can chart your own course ahead of time.\nChecking in ASL version of Checking in This is an American Sign Language (ASL) video with no audio Continue to the next video: Mobility aids at the terminal When you check in, reconfirm that you will receive the services you requested when you made your reservation and received written confirmation (this is usually in your itinerary). Your carrier is required, upon request, to help you through the terminal to the boarding gate/platform and all the way to your seat on board if needed. If you have a service dog, you may want to ask for directions to the relief area. Terminal operators must provide designated relief areas outside the terminal and on the secure side, which can be reached without having to leave the secure area and re-enter it.\nMobility aids at the terminal ASL version of Mobility aids at the terminal This is an American Sign Language (ASL) video with no audio Continue to the next video: Security screening If you use a power wheelchair or other large mobility aid, your carrier will usually need time to prepare it for the trip. This means that somewhere between check-in and boarding, you may need to transfer to a boarding wheelchair. However, your carrier is required to allow you to keep your mobility aid until it becomes necessary to store it and if you use a manual, folding wheelchair, your carrier will generally allow you to remain in it until boarding. Your carrier may have asked you to provide written instructions for the disassembly and reassembly of your mobility aid, but you may want to ask how your mobility aid will be secured and stored.\nSecurity screening ASL version of Security screening This is an American Sign Language (ASL) video with no audio Continue to the next video: Boarding If you are required to go through a security screening process, screening officers will want to see your boarding pass, and they may ask to see prescriptions if you bring your medications on board. Keep your passport, boarding pass, prescriptions and any other important travel documents close at hand. In Canadian airports, it is the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA) officers who screen passengers entering the secure zones and boarding areas. If you ask, CATSA will: expedite the screening process by directing you \u2014 and your support person if you are travelling with one \u2014 to the front of the line or to a different line designated for expediting the screening process;\npermit a representative of an airline, or an individual with a security pass issued by an airline or the airport, to accompany you through the security screening checkpoint;\nassist you with proceeding through the steps of the security screening process, including by providing verbal or visual cues or additional instructions;\nmake a private room available on request when a physical search is required; and\nassist you with the placement of your carry-on baggage and personal items on a screening belt and with their retrieval. If you are travelling with an assistive device, support person or service dog, CATSA must make every reasonable effort to carry out the screening simultaneously with the screening of the assistive device, support person, or service dog. Also, if CATSA removes your assistive device for separate screening, it must immediately return it to you after it has been screened. If your mobility aid is removed for separate screening, CATSA must offer you a chair while your aid is being screened. Note: CATSA provides useful information for travellers with disabilities about the screening process on its website, including information for planning a trip and what to expect at screening checkpoints. You may want to consult the CATSA website prior to travel to familiarize yourself with the screening process. For more information, see the CTA's Requirements applicable to the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority and the Canada Border Services Agency: A Guide.\nBoarding ASL version of Boarding This is an American Sign Language (ASL) video with no audio Continue to the next video: Seating and layout Your carrier can provide you with assistance with boarding and, if you are travelling on a ferry, help you in moving from a vehicle deck to a passenger deck. Your carrier is required to allow you to board in advance of other passengers if: you have asked for help with boarding, locating your seat or cabin, transferring between a mobility aid and your seat, or storing carry-on luggage;\nyou are blind or have any other visual impairment and you have asked for a description of the layout of the airplane, train, ferry or bus, or of the location and operation of operating controls at your seat; or\nyou are disabled due to a severe allergy and have asked to clean your seat to remove any potential allergens. Note: If you ask for this type of assistance, your carrier may require you to board before the other passengers or, if you arrive at the boarding area after the end of priority boarding, to board after the other passengers.\nOnboard\nSeating and layout ASL version of Seating and layout This is an American Sign Language (ASL) video with no audio Continue to the next video: Announcements Once onboard, if you are blind or have any other visual impairment, your carrier is required \u2014 upon your request \u2014 to describe the layout of the transportation equipment, including the location of washrooms and exits, and the location and operation of any operating controls at your seat. You can also ask for help to find and transfer into your seat and to put away and retrieve your carry-on luggage.\nAnnouncements ASL version of Announcements This is an American Sign Language (ASL) video with no audio Continue to the next video: Meals or snacks Once you've settled into your seat, take a moment to find the briefing card with safety information. Most carriers will provide a general safety demonstration before departure but are required to provide an individualized briefing and demonstration if you request one. Carriers are also required to make announcements (for example, regarding weather, delays, baggage retrieval, and connections) in an audio or a visual format upon request by a traveller.\nMeals or snacks ASL version of Meals or snacks This is an American Sign Language (ASL) video with no audio Continue to the next video: On-board wheelchairs and access to washrooms The on-board crew are required to offer limited help with meals or snacks \u2014 opening packages, identifying food items and their location and cutting large food portions \u2014 but are not required to assist a passenger with feeding. If you are blind or have any other visual impairment, you can ask them to describe all the food and beverages that are offered or to provide you with a menu in large print or Braille. And, if you are travelling by train and you are unable to access the food-service car, you (and your support person, if you are travelling with one) can order a meal and have it served at your seat or in your cabin.\nOn-board wheelchairs and access to washrooms ASL version of On-board wheelchairs and access to washrooms This is an American Sign Language (ASL) video with no audio Continue to the next video: Onboard entertainment On-board crew on trains and ferries, and on airplanes which have sufficiently wide aisles, can assist you to go between your seat and the washroom using an on-board wheelchair, including by assisting in your transfer between your seat and the on-board wheelchair. On an airplane, you can use the washroom that has the most space, regardless of where it is located, if you need an on-board wheelchair or the help of a support person or service dog to use the washroom. On-board crew are not required to assist a passenger inside a washroom.\nOnboard entertainment ASL version of Onboard entertainment This is an American Sign Language (ASL) video with no audio Continue to the next video: Arrival If there is on-board entertainment available, your carrier must assist you in using it, upon your request. If you have provided advance notice to your carrier that you would like a personal electronic device (for example, a tablet), your carrier must provide you with one and help you use it if you request assistance. Note: If an on-board entertainment system on a Canadian carrier's transportation equipment does not offer content with closed captioning and audio description, the carrier must provide you with a personal electronic device if you ask for one. The device must be preloaded with entertainment content that offers closed captioning and audio description. Alternatively, this must be available through wireless streaming. The content available on the personal electronic devices must be the same as the content available through the on-board entertainment system or, when this is not possible, it must be reasonably similar to the content offered to other passengers. A carrier cannot charge you for a personal electronic device. However, if it charges passengers for accessing on-board entertainment, it can charge you for using the personal electronic device that it provides to you on the same basis that it charges other passengers who access on-board entertainment content and who are travelling in the same class of service as you. For more information, see the CTA's On-board entertainment: A Guide.\nArrival ASL version of Arrival This is an American Sign Language (ASL) video with no audio Continue to the next video: Disembarking You've arrived at your destination! It's time to gather your baggage and head towards the exit of the terminal building or, if you are making a connection, to continue your journey.\nDisembarking ASL version of Disembarking This is an American Sign Language (ASL) video with no audio Continue to the next video: Retrieving your mobility aids If your journey has ended, upon your request, your carrier is required to help you disembark from the aircraft, train, bus or ferry, retrieve your checked baggage, proceed to the general public area, and proceed to a location where you can receive assistance to get to the curbside zone. If you are continuing your journey, upon your request, your carrier is required to assist you in getting to a location where you can receive help from your connecting carrier.\nRetrieving your mobility aids ASL version of Retrieving your mobility aids This is an American Sign Language (ASL) video with no audio Continue to the next video: Border clearance Your mobility aid should be returned to you at your destination in the same condition as when you checked it in, however, damage can occur. If this is the case, having photos of your mobility aid can help establish that the damage happened while your aid was in the carrier\u2019s possession. It is recommended that you take two sets of photos: the first, just before giving your mobility aid to your carrier for transportation; and the second, of the damage to your mobility aid. The two sets of photos can then be compared, which can show the nature and location of the damage. Before leaving the terminal, be sure to complete a damage claim and provide it to your carrier. If your mobility aid is damaged, destroyed, lost or not returned to you within the usual time frame after you reach your destination, depending on the circumstances, your carrier must: provide you with a temporary replacement aid that meets your needs;\nreimburse you for expenses you incurred as a result;\narrange for the repair of your mobility or, if this is not possible, provide a suitable replacement or reimburse you for the full replacement cost; or\nif your mobility aid has been destroyed or lost, provide a suitable replacement or reimburse you for the full replacement cost. Note: if you are travelling on an international flight, your airline is required to tell you about the option of completing a special declaration of interest, which is a document designed to protect the value of a traveller's mobility aid. A traveller states the monetary value of their mobility aid and provides a description of its identifying features in the special declaration. A special declaration of interest is important because, without it, carriers' limits of liability for mobility aids carried on international flights are capped at a level far less than the value of most aids. This means that, if a mobility aid is lost, damaged or destroyed and the traveller has not completed a special declaration of interest, they may only be entitled to reimbursement for a portion of the value of the mobility aid. Airlines that operate international flights are required to publish a notice on their websites about the option of completing a special declaration of interest.\nBorder clearance ASL version of Border clearance This is an American Sign Language (ASL) video with no audio Continue to the next video: Curbside assistance when you are leaving the terminal If you are returning to Canada from another country, you must go through the border clearance process. If you ask, CBSA will: expedite the border clearance process by directing you \u2013 and your support person if you are travelling with one \u2014 to the front of the line or to a different line designated for expediting the border clearance process;\nassist you with proceeding through the steps of the border clearance process, including by providing verbal or visual cues or additional instructions;\nassist you with completing a declaration card or by collecting a verbal declaration; and\nassist you with the placement of your personal items on a counter for inspection and with their retrieval, if you must undergo more extensive clearance.\nCurbside assistance when you are leaving the terminal ASL version of Curbside assistance when you are leaving the terminal This is an American Sign Language (ASL) video with no audio Continue to the next video: Ground transportation to your destination When you are ready to leave the terminal, your carrier can help you reach the general public area and, if you want curbside assistance, to a specific place in the general public area where terminal staff can help you to get to the curbside zone. The particular place will depend on the terminal. It could be a service desk, or a place where there is an accessible telephone or buzzer system that you can use to request curbside assistance from the terminal operator.\nGround transportation to your destination ASL version of Ground transportation to your destination This is an American Sign Language (ASL) video with no audio Continue to the next video: Resolving problems You will also have to plan on how you will get from the terminal to your final destination. Terminal operators that have an arrangement with a company for ground transportation from the terminal \u2014 including by taxi, limousine, bus or rental vehicle \u2014 must ensure that vehicles can carry mobility aids (or any other assistive devices). The terminal operator must also ensure that there are rental vehicles that are equipped with hand-control systems.\nResolving problems ASL version of Resolving problems This is an American Sign Language (ASL) video with no audio Continue to the next video: We\u2019re here to help Sometimes things can go wrong with even the best-planned trip. If a problem arises or you have a concern related to your trip, let the transportation service provider know. Often, a discussion is all that's required to fix the problem or address the concern. Keep your receipts and documents, and a record of who you talked with and when. It's a good idea to write a description of what happened as soon as you can, while the details are still fresh in your mind. If you have tried to discuss your concern with the transportation service provider and aren't satisfied with the result, you can contact the CTA. You can also contact us as a first step to resolving your concern if that is your preference. Our staff can facilitate a conversation with the transportation service provider, which can lead to addressing the concern. If these processes don't work, then you can ask the CTA to formally investigate your complaint. To start the process, you will need to file a statement and, if available, supporting evidence. The transportation service provider will also be given an opportunity to file a statement and evidence. You will then be given a final opportunity to reply to the transportation service provider's statement and evidence. The CTA will make a binding decision. It can include corrective measures, a refund of the expenses that you incurred because of the problem, or compensation for pain, suffering, or willful or reckless practice.

Purpose ASL version of Chapter 1. Purpose Continue to the next video: Chapter 2. Mobility aids and other assistive devices covered by the ATPDR This guide explains the requirements in the Accessible Transportation for Persons with Disabilities Regulations (ATPDR) regarding the use of mobility aids and other assistive devices by persons with disabilities. In particular, this guide describes: What mobility aids and other assistive devices are covered by the ATPDR ;\n; Obligations of transportation service providers concerning: Services for travellers who use mobility aids and other assistive devices; The accessibility of transportation equipment and terminals for travellers who use mobility aids and other assistive devices; Publishing information on services and related conditions; Retaining information and documentation for future trips; and Personnel training\nResponsibilities of travellers who use mobility aids and other assistive devices; and\nTips for travellers who use mobility aids and other assistive devices. Transportation service providers not covered by the ATPDR may have other obligations regarding the use of mobility aids and other assistive devices by persons with disabilities. For more information consult For more information consult Accessible transportation guides - Introduction . This is not a legal document. The explanations and definitions it provides are for general guidance purposes only. The obligations for transporting mobility and other assistive devices can be found in the ATPDR, Part 1 and reflected in Annex A of this guide. In case of differences between this guide and legislation or regulations, the legislation and regulations prevail. Nothing in the Regulations or this Guide is to be construed as limiting the duty to accommodate under the Canadian Human Rights Act or any other Act of Parliament; or requiring any person to do anything that jeopardizes security, public health or public safety.\n2. Mobility aids and other assistive devices covered by the ATPDR ASL version of Chapter 2. Mobility aids and other assistive devices covered by the ATPDR Continue to the next video: Chapter 3. Obligations relating to services for travellers who use mobility aids and other assistive devices The ATPDR contain requirements that transportation service providers must meet to ensure that persons who have mobility aids or other assistive devices can travel with these. Mobility aid means any manual or electric wheelchair, scooter, boarding chair, walker, cane, crutch, prosthesis or other aid that is specially designed to assist a person with a disability with a need related to mobility. Assistive device means any medical device, mobility aid, communication aid or other aid that is specially designed to assist a person with a disability with a need related to their disability.\n3. Obligations relating to services for travellers who use mobility aids and other assistive devices ASL version of Chapter 3. Obligations relating to services for travellers who use mobility aids and other assistive devices Continue to the next video: Carriers \u2014 Services for passengers travelling with mobility aids Transportation that is accessible to persons with disabilities respects principles of equality, inclusion and dignity. A traveller's mobility aid, or other assistive device, is essential to their independence, safety and comfort during their travel. The ATPDR requirements concerning mobility aids and other assistive devices reflect these principles and set out obligations for carriers, terminal operators, the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority, and the Canada Border Services Agency.\nCarriers \u2014 Services for passengers travelling with mobility aids ASL version of Carriers \u2014 Services for passengers travelling with mobility aids Continue to the next video: Allow passengers to keep their mobility aids as long as possible Carriers are required to provide the services listed below to a passenger who uses a mobility aid or other assistive device. Providing these services, in some cases, depends on the passenger fulfilling certain conditions; for example, requesting services in advance (see Advance Notice/Supporting Documentation Requesting Services for Persons with Disabilities: A Guide) or providing information/documents, such as written instructions for the disassembly and reassembly of a mobility aid (see Section 6).\nAllow passengers to keep their mobility aids as long as possible ASL version of Allow passengers to keep their mobility aids as long as possible Continue to the next video: Assist passengers who are not independently mobile Carriers are required to permit passengers to retain their mobility aids until it becomes necessary to store them. In some cases - such as when a mobility aid doesn't need to be disassembled for storage, because it is foldable, light or easy to store for example \u2014 this could mean that a passenger can remain in their mobility aid until they board at the gate. In other cases, they may have to transfer out of their mobility aid sooner (for example, at check-in) to allow enough time for the carrier to move their mobility aid through the terminal to the baggage loading area, and to then disassemble, package and load the mobility aid safely prior to departure.\nAssist passengers who are not independently mobile ASL version of Assist passengers who are not independently mobile Continue to the next video: Transport mobility aids as priority baggage If a passenger who is in a wheelchair (or any other device) in which they are not independently mobile is waiting at a terminal for departure after checking in or in order to transfer to another segment of their trip, carrier personnel must: Provide the passenger with a place to wait that is close to personnel who are available to provide assistance if needed; and\nPeriodically ask the passenger whether they need any assistance and provide that assistance.\nTransport mobility aids as priority baggage ASL version of Transport mobility aids as priority baggage Continue to the next video: Store mobility aids on board transportation equipment Carriers must transport mobility aids needed during travel as priority baggage. This may require removing other cargo or baggage from storage if necessary to make room for the storage of a mobility aid. Carriers are also required to: Disassemble and package a mobility aid if necessary to store it and to unpackage and reassemble it on arrival at the passenger's destination; and\nPromptly return the mobility aid to the passenger on arrival at their destination. Note:Mobility aid batteries may need to be removed and packaged separately to ensure they can be transported safely. Carrier personnel must ensure, as part of reassembling a mobility aid, that batteries that were removed for transport are reattached and operational before returning the aid to the passenger. Some types of batteries, particularly those labelled as lithium metal or lithium ion batteries, may be prohibited from transport due to Transportation of Dangerous Goods Regulations. Carriers can refuse to transport a mobility aid if: The weight or size of the mobility aid exceeds the capacity of boarding equipment such as lifts and ramps (applicable to aircraft, trains, ferries and buses);\nThe combined weight of a passenger who must remain in their mobility aid in order to board and the weight of the mobility aid exceeds the capacity of the boarding equipment (applicable to trains, ferries and buses);\nThe doors to baggage compartments (applicable to aircraft, trains, and buses) are too small for the mobility aid;\nThe turning radii of all cars are too small for the mobility aid (applicable to trains);\nThe size of the baggage compartments is too small for the mobility aid (applicable to aircraft and buses); or\nTransportation of the mobility aid would jeopardize aircraft airworthiness. (Note: this includes considerations which affect the safe operation of an aircraft, such as the weight of cargo and balancing this weight to maintain proper control and stability or the need to comply with Transportation of Dangerous Goods Regulations.) However, carriers that refuse to carry a mobility aid must: At the time of the refusal, tell the passenger why their mobility aid was not accepted and provide this in writing within the next 10 days; and\nLet the passenger know about alternative trips operated by the carrier to the same destination on which their mobility aid can be transported, and offer to book this for the passenger at the lesser of the fare for the original trip and the fare for the alternative trip. Example: An airline advises Ms. Smith that it cannot transport her mobility aid because the aircraft's cargo door is too small for her mobility aid. The airline, however, informs Ms. Smith that it will be operating a flight to the same destination the next day using an aircraft that can accommodate her mobility aid. The airline also informs Ms. Smith that, although the fare for the new flight is higher, she'll be charged the fare for the original flight. With Ms. Smith's agreement, the airline makes a reservation for Ms. Smith on the alternative flight. Recommended practice: Reservation agents should obtain information from a passenger on the weight and dimensions of their mobility aid and ask whether there are any parts that can be removed or collapsed for storage. Information should also be obtained on the type and number of batteries that need to be transported and passengers should be advised of any restrictions or special packaging requirements. When there's been a change in transportation equipment \u2014 especially when the replacement equipment is smaller \u2014 carriers should immediately contact passengers who are travelling with mobility aids, to reconfirm that their aids can be transported on the alternative equipment. This avoids passengers going to the terminal on the day of departure only to be told that there's been a change in equipment and their mobility aids can no longer be transported.\nStore mobility aids on board transportation equipment ASL version of Store mobility aids on board transportation equipment Continue to the next video: Take measures when a mobility aid is damaged, destroyed or lost during transport Rail and marine carriers must permit a passenger who uses a mobility aid to store it on the train or ferry. Each train must have at least one storage space and each deck of a ferry must also have one. Rail and marine carriers must store mobility aids in a manner that protects them from damage, including by using an anchoring system or by placing them in an area that is not intended for use by passengers. Airlines must make a reasonable effort to permit passengers who use walkers or manual folding wheelchairs to store them in the aircraft cabin. Similarly, bus carriers must make a reasonable effort to permit passengers who use walkers or manual folding wheelchairs to store them in the passenger section of the bus. Where this is not possible, those aids must be stored in baggage compartments. Note: A carrier's ability to store mobility aids in the cabin may depend on availability of space in the cabin. Airlines are not required to block seats or deny boarding to customers in order to accommodate a manual folding wheelchair.\nTake measures when a mobility aid is damaged, destroyed or lost during transport ASL version of Take measures when a mobility aid is damaged, destroyed or lost during transport Continue to the next video: Offer the option of a special declaration of interest for international air travel Carriers must, without delay and at their own expense, take the following measures when a mobility aid that is not retained by a passenger during transport is damaged, destroyed, lost or not returned to the passenger within the usual time frame after they arrive at their destination: Provide the passenger with a temporary replacement mobility aid that meets their needs and allow them to use it until their mobility aid is returned to them or is repaired or replaced, or until the passenger is reimbursed for the loss of the mobility aid;\nReimburse the passenger for any expenses they incurred because the mobility aid was damaged, destroyed or lost, or because it was not returned to them when they arrived at their destination;\nArrange for the repair of a mobility aid that has been damaged and promptly return it to the passenger or, if it cannot be adequately repaired: Replace the damaged aid with the same model or, if that is not available, with a model that meets the passenger's needs and has features and qualities equivalent to those of the damaged aid, or Reimburse the passenger for the full replacement cost of the aid; and\nIn the case of a destroyed mobility aid, or once a mobility aid has been declared lost (96 hours after arrival in air travel or 72 hours after arrival in rail, ferry or bus travel: Replace the destroyed or lost mobility aid with the same model or, if that is not available, with a model that meets the passenger's needs and has equivalent features and qualities as the destroyed or lost aid, or Reimburse the passenger for the full replacement cost of the aid\nNote:Carriers must ensure that any temporary or permanent replacement mobility aid meets the passenger's needs. This should be determined in discussion with the passenger and assumptions should not be made about the passenger's mobility needs. Although a carrier is obligated to replace a lost mobility aid within the specified time frame following the passenger's arrival at their destination (72 hours for bus, ferry and rail travel and 96 hours for air travel), in cases where the mobility aid is only misplaced but not permanently lost, the passenger may voluntarily accept a carrier's offer to continue using a temporary replacement mobility aid beyond this time frame until their own mobility aid can be returned to them. Passengers whose mobility aids are highly customized may prefer this alternative to being provided with a new mobility aid.\nOffer the option of a special declaration of interest for international air travel ASL version of Offer the option of a special declaration of interest for international air travel Continue to the next video: Carriers \u2014 Services for passengers travelling with other assistive devices When a person who wants to travel with their mobility aid makes a reservation with an airline for an international flight, the airline must advise them of the option to make a special declaration of interest. A special declaration of interest sets out the monetary value of the mobility aid and a description of its features in case of destruction, loss, damage or delay. The airline must permit a passenger to make a special declaration of interest at any time before the mobility aid is taken from the passenger for storage in the aircraft\u2019s baggage compartment. An airline that operates an international flight must publish a notice on its website that passengers who use mobility aids have the option to make a special declaration of interest. For domestic travel, airlines should be aware that the CTA 's Air Passenger Protection Regulations (APPR) apply the provisions of the Montreal Convention on lost, damaged and delayed baggage to domestic flights. For more information on the APPR baggage requirements, please see Baggage Requirements for Domestic Services: A Guide.\nCarriers \u2014 Services for passengers travelling with other assistive devices ASL version of Carriers \u2014 Services for passengers travelling with other assistive devices Continue to the next video: Publishing information on transporting mobility aids and other assistive devices Common assistive devices used by persons with disabilities are canes, crutches, communication devices (for example, a speech generating device which translates typed messages into digitized speech), orthotic positioning devices (used to support and position a person who has postural problems), and portable oxygen concentrators. Carriers must allow a passenger to keep a small assistive device with them on board if they need it during travel, provided the assistive device remaining with the customer does not create an onboard safety issue and is subjected to onboard safety requirements. Providing these services, in some cases, depends on the passenger fulfilling certain conditions (see Section 6). Note: Travellers with disabilities may require disability-related equipment or supplies at destination -- such as an additional mobility aid, a prosthetic limb, or food for a service dog. Refusing to accept such items, or charging travellers for their carriage, may constitute an undue obstacle to travel in the national transportation system. It is strongly recommended that carriers accept reasonable quantities of such items at no additional charge to the traveller, unless they can demonstrate that doing so would cause undue hardship (for example, the configuration of a small aircraft may not permit carriage of an additional large mobility aid). Travellers with disabilities are encouraged to provide advance notice of their request to carry disability-related items at no additional charge, and to be prepared, in some cases, to provide medical documentation to allow the carrier to assess the request. Recommendation: Carriers are subject to numerous safety rules and regulations, some of which can impact on the transportation of assistive devices. Reservation agents should obtain information from a passenger on their assistive device, including whether it uses batteries or needs an onboard power supply, and advise the passenger of any restrictions.\nPublishing information on transporting mobility aids and other assistive devices ASL version of Carriers \u2014 Publishing information on transporting mobility aids and other assistive devices Continue to the next video: Retain information and documents for future trips A notice listing their obligations concerning the transportation of mobility aids and other assistive devices (specifically, which ATPDR provisions apply); and\nprovisions apply); and The services they offer to passengers travelling with mobility aids and other assistive devices and any conditions on those services. Carriers must publish on their website the maximum weight and dimensions of mobility aids that each make and model of its transportation equipment is capable of transporting. Carriers without a website must publish information in another way that passengers can easily find, such as in a brochure. This requirement applies to all publishing obligations noted in this guide.\nRetain information and documents for future trips ASL version of Retain information and documents for future trips Continue to the next video: Terminal operators \u2014 Services for travellers who use mobility aids If a carrier requests information or documents from a person who wants to travel with a mobility aid or other assistive device, the carrier must offer to retain an electronic copy for at least three years. This avoids a person having to provide the same information or documents each time they travel with the carrier. Note: A carrier may ask a person to confirm, at the time of a new reservation, if information or documents already on file about the person's mobility aid or other assistive device have changed since they were provided to the carrier.\nTerminal operators \u2014 Services for travellers who use mobility aids ASL version of Terminal operators \u2014 Services for travellers who use mobility aids Continue to the next video: Curbside assistance Terminal operators must ensure that certain services are accessible to travellers using mobility aids or other assistive devices.

Note: At some terminals, carriers choose to provide curbside assistance themselves, rather than having the terminal operator provide the service. If this is the case, terminal operators must still make sure the requirements outlined above are met. More information can be found in Curbside assistance: A guide . Publish information on curbside assistance Terminal operators must publish on their website information about the location of the curbside zone and how to request curbside assistance.\nEnsure accessible ground transportation from terminals ASL version of Ensure accessible ground transportation from terminals Continue to the next video: Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA) The ATPDR recognize that, like many travellers, those with disabilities often rely on ground transportation to be able to complete their trip. Terminal Operators that have an agreement with a service provider for the provision of ground transportation from the terminal \u2014 including by taxi, limousine, bus or rental vehicle \u2014 must ensure that the transportation is accessible to a person travelling with a mobility aid (or any other assistive device), including by using vehicles that can carry non-folding or non-collapsible mobility aids. The terminal operator must ensure that there are rental vehicles that are equipped with hand-control systems. Publish information on accessible ground transportation Terminal operators must publish on their website information about accessible ground transportation. Publish information on curbside assistance and accessible ground transportation Terminal operators must publish on their website information about the location of the curbside zone and how to request curbside assistance, and information on accessible ground transportation.\nCanadian Air Transport Security Authority ( CATSA ) ASL version of Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA) Continue to the next video: Chapter 4. Personnel training obligations CATSA must, when screening a traveller who has an assistive device (including a mobility aid): Make a reasonable effort to simultaneously screen the traveller\u2019s assistive device;\nImmediately return an assistive device that has been removed for separate screening to the traveller after it has been screened; and\nOffer a chair to a traveller whose mobility aid has been removed for separate screening, while the mobility aid is being screened. Note: The screening of travellers with mobility aids or other assistive devices may involve special procedures such as swabbing for explosive trace detection. CATSA provides useful information for travellers with disabilities about the screening process on its website, including information on planning a trip and what to expect at screening checkpoints. Travellers who use mobility aids or other assistive devices may wish to consult the CATSA website prior to travel to familiarize themselves with the screening process.\n4. Personnel training obligations ASL version of Chapter 4. Personnel training obligations Continue to the next video: Chapter 5. Obligations relating to the accessibility of transportation equipment and terminals to travellers who use a mobility aid Canadian carriers, terminal operators, the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority and the Canada Border Services Agency must ensure that their personnel who interact with the public, or participate in making decisions or developing policies and procedures that specifically affect travellers who use mobility aids or other assistive devices, receive training on: the assistive devices that are commonly used;\nthe different types of mobility aids;\nthe requirements and appropriate methods for transporting and storing mobility aids, including the disassembling, packaging, unpackaging and reassembling of mobility aids; and\nusing, or assisting a traveller with a disability in using carrier-operated equipment, including a lift, a ramp and any other level-change device. While foreign carriers operating services to and from Canada are not subject to the training requirements set out in Part 1 of the ATPDR, all carriers are encouraged to ensure that their personnel receive the same or equivalent training regarding mobility aids and assistive devices.\n5. Obligations relating to the accessibility of transportation equipment and terminals to travellers who use a mobility aid ASL version of Chapter 5. Obligations relating to the accessibility of transportation equipment and terminals to travellers who use a mobility aid Continue to the next video: Transportation equipment - Aircraft A traveller who uses a mobility aid generally wants to be able to remain in it as much as possible given its importance to their independence, dignity, safety and comfort. The Canadian Standards Association's (CSA) CAN/CSA-B651-18 Accessible design for the built environment (CSA B651-18) contains requirements for making buildings and other facilities accessible to persons with various disabilities, including those relating to a person's mobility. Many of the requirements in CSA B651-18 are based on the concept of a \"manual wheelchair\" and reflect criteria designed to permit persons using their wheelchairs, as well other assistive devices such as walkers and crutches, to access and manoeuver within a space and use the features that it contains. The ATPDR provisions applicable to transportation equipment and terminals incorporate relevant requirements in CSA B651-18. Note: Power wheelchairs and scooters generally have longer footprints than manual wheelchairs. The ATPDR provisions represent minimum requirements which carriers and terminal operators can (and sometimes, should) choose to exceed. All Canadian carriers are required to meet the technical requirements in the ATPDR found in Part 3, and terminal operators are required to meet the technical requirements found in Part 4 for terminals located in Canada. Information on the applicability of these requirements for all modes can be found in Transportation service providers covered by the Accessible Transportation for Persons with Disabilities Regulations: A guide .\nTransportation equipment\nTransportation equipment - Aircraft ASL version of Transportation equipment - Aircraft Continue to the next video: Transportation equipment - Trains Aircraft have obvious physical constraints and inherent structural limitations which mean that space is limited, such that the ATPDR requirements relate to the use of on-board wheelchairs as opposed to passenger-owned wheelchairs that may be larger or more difficult to accommodate.\nTransportation equipment - Trains ASL version of Transportation equipment - Trains Continue to the next video: Transportation equipment - Ferries Trains are required to have mobility aid spaces to enable passengers to remain in their mobility aids during travel in addition to providing on-board wheelchairs for passengers whose mobility aids are stored. Trains are required to meet requirements in CSA B651-18 to permit a passenger using a wheelchair to access, and travel between, adjacent areas which are required to be wheelchair-accessible, such as a wheelchair-accessible cabin, food service area, wheelchair-accessible washroom, and a mobility aid space. Trains must also meet CSA B651-18 requirements applicable for persons using mobility aids relating to such things as doors and operating controls.\nTransportation equipment - Ferries ASL version of Transportation equipment - Ferries Continue to the next video: Transportation equipment - Buses The ATPDR require that most areas and amenities on a ferry be accessible to passengers using mobility aids and meet applicable CSA B651-18 requirements. Ferries, relative to other transportation equipment, provide ample space for passengers who use mobility aids and, consequently, most passengers choose to remain in their mobility aid during travel. However, in recognition that some passengers prefer to store their mobility aid, the ATPDR require ferries to have on-board wheelchairs and storage for mobility aids.\nTransportation equipment - Buses ASL version of Transportation equipment - Buses Continue to the next video: Transportation equipment - Terminals Buses are required to have mobility aid spaces to enable passengers to remain in their mobility aids during travel. Alternatively, passengers can store these in baggage compartments. The ATPDR also require buses to have wheelchair-accessible washrooms where space permits and contain specifications regarding the placement of operating controls and grab bars, and handholds and stanchions to meet the needs of passengers who remain in their wheelchairs.\nTransportation equipment - Terminals ASL version of Transportation equipment - Terminals Continue to the next video: Chapter 6. Responsibilities of travellers who use a mobility aid or other assistive device Terminal operators are required to meet all of the requirements in CSA B651-18, with some exceptions, including requirements regarding bathtubs, viewing spaces in assembly areas, and residential accommodation. Terminal operators are also required to meet requirements applicable to lifts, ramps, stairs, and light-rail trains and shuttle buses operating at terminals.\n6. Responsibilities of travellers who use a mobility aid or other assistive device ASL version of Chapter 6. Responsibilities of travellers who use a mobility aid or other assistive device Continue to the next video: Provide advance notice The ATPDR recognize that carriers are responsible for the safety of their passengers and personnel and that this can require them to establish travel conditions, including for passengers who use a mobility aid or other assistive device. There are things a person who wants to travel with their mobility aid or device can do to help avoid problems during their trip\nProvide advance notice ASL version of Provide advance notice Continue to the next video: Provide Information for the disassembly and reassembly of a mobility aid and arrive early A carrier may require a person who intends to travel with their mobility aid or other assistive device to provide it with advance notice. Generally speaking, a person with a disability will have to make a request for services at least 48 hours before their departure. They can do this by contacting the carrier directly; for example, by phone, email or through their website. Some carriers may also refer passengers to a specialized department such as a medical desk. However, if the carrier requires documents or information from a person to provide them the service, a carrier may need up to 96-hour notice before departure to assess the request. In this situation, the person will have 48 hours to provide the documents and/or information the carrier has requested. Once the person has provided this, the carrier may take up to 48 additional hours to assess the request. If the person with a disability gives advance notice but the information or documents provided are insufficient or the notice period includes a day that is a weekend day or holiday, the carrier may not be able to complete its assessment of the request. In these cases, the carrier may not be required to provide the service. For this reason, it is important that travellers provide the requested documents or information and make every effort to give advance notice that includes two full business days. Note: A carrier is required to make a reasonable effort to transport a mobility aid or other assistive device even if the person does not provide advance notice or submit the information or documents required by the carrier. Why it is important to provide advance notice: Providing a carrier with adequate advance notice about the need to travel with a mobility aid or other assistive device will enable it to ensure that the aid can be carried on the transportation equipment that's scheduled for use on the trip and, if this isn't possible, advise the passenger what alternative trips are available for travelling with the mobility aid or assistive device. The carrier can also explain any restrictions; for example, on the number or types of batteries due to safety reasons, and whether there is a power supply on board the transportation equipment that can be used for an assistive device.\nProvide Information for the disassembly and reassembly of a mobility aid and arrive early ASL version of Provide Information for the disassembly and reassembly of a mobility aid and arrive early Continue to the next video: Chapter 7. Travel tips for passengers who travel with a mobility aid or other assistive device A carrier may require a passenger whose mobility aid needs to be disassembled and packaged in order for it to be stored, and unpackaged and reassembled upon arrival at the passenger's destination, to: Provide the carrier with written instructions for the disassembly and reassembly of the mobility aid; and\nCheck in or arrive at the boarding area before the standard time for check-in or\nProvide medical certificates and other information and documents. When a person intends to travel with their mobility aid or other assistive device, the carrier may require that they provide any information or documents that are reasonably necessary to permit the carrier to assess the person\u2019s request; for example, written instructions for the disassembly and reassembly of a mobility aid or a medical certificate for some devices (for example, portable oxygen concentrators).\nChapter 7.

These recommendations aim to guide the decision-makers of natural resources in tourism in undertaking accessibility improvements. The document has a particular focus on facilitating access to protected areas, beaches and parks. The WCPA Tourism and Protected Areas Specialist Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT), acted as the expert reviewers. Their involvement was key in identifying the best actions geared towards a greater extent of accessibility and inclusiveness within nature areas, vis a vis tourism. The guidance tool, whose drafting was led by UNWTO, the ONCE Foundation and UNE, is part of the promotion of ISO Standard 21902:2021.

Yet, a change in mind-set and in the model of tourism services provision is needed in order to meet this major market demand. Accessible environments and services contribute to improve the quality of the tourism product and can create more job opportunities for people with disabilities. Accessibility, therefore, must be an intrinsic part of any responsible and sustainable tourism policy and strategy.\nWorld Tourism Day 2016: \"Tourism for All - promoting universal accessibility\" To mark the celebration of the World Tourism Day 2016 under the theme \"Tourism for All - promoting universal accessibility\" UNWTO, the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT) and the Spanish ONCE Foundation for the Social Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities have produced a compilation of Good Practices in the Accessible Tourism Supply Chain.

Published At 01/01/2010 What is \"Accessible Tourism\"?\nThere is no single, universally accepted definition of \"accessible tourism\". Here we refer to some of the ways in which the term is defined and used. The concept is certain to evolve as it is applied in more and more contexts around the world.\n- \u201cAccessible Tourism\u201d (also known as \u201cAccess Tourism\u201d, \u201cUniversal Tourism\u201d, \u201cInclusive Tourism\u201d and in some countries such as in Japan \u201cBarrier-free Tourism\u201d) is tourism and travel that is accessible to all people, with disabilities or not, including those with mobility, hearing, sight, cognitive, or intellectual and psychosocial disabilities, older persons and those with temporary disabilities\" (Takayama Declaration - Appendix, UNESCAP, 2009).\n- \" 'Accessible Tourism' refers to tourism that caters to the needs of a full range of consumers including persons with disabilities, older persons and cross-generational families. It entails removal of attitudinal and institutional barriers in society, and encompasses accessibility in the physical environment, in transportation, information and communications and other facilities and services. It encompasses publicly and privately owned tourist locations.\" (Takayama City and UNESCAP Conference - Press Release - Takayama, 2009)\n- \"Accessible tourism is the ongoing endeavour to ensure tourist destinations, products and services are accessible to all people, regardless of their physical limitations, disabilities or age. It encompasses publicly and privately owned tourist locations. The improvements not only benefit those with permanent physical disabilities, but also parents with small children, elderly travellers, people with temporary injuries such as a broken leg, as well as their travel companions.\" (Accessible Tourism on Wikipedia - downloaded 1 January 2010).\n- ...a process of enabling people with disabilities and seniors to function independently and with equity and dignity through the delivery of universal tourism products, services and environments. The definition is inclusive of the mobility, vision, hearing and cognitive dimensions of access (Darcy, 2006, p. 6).\nDarcy, S. (2006). Setting a Research Agenda for Accessible Tourism. In C. Cooper, T. D. LacY & L. Jago (Eds.), STCRC Technical Report Seriespp. 48).

This definition is inclusive of all people including those travelling with children in prams, people with disabilities and seniors (Darcy & Dickson, 2009, p. 34). Reference : Darcy, S., & Dickson, T. (2009). A Whole-of-Life Approach to Tourism: The Case for Accessible Tourism Experiences. Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management, 16(1), 32-44.\n- ...When people hear the word \u201caccessible\u201d attached to tourism they think they have a pretty good idea what that means. And there is the problem. Almost everybody thinks they know what it means but, since it has never been fully defined, almost everybody has invented their own personal definition. That is a recipe for disaster. If travellers and the industry have no common language, then imagine how frequent disappointment and disputes will become? If hotel owners and construction teams have no way to describe the solutions they want designed and built, then how likely is either side to be satisfied with the result?

Certain sustainable development is ambiguous ground but in the tourism activities it is very pressing for the negative impacts of the classical tourism model.\nThese assumptions are useful to analyze the costs and benefits of inclusive tourism, thanks to the pyramid of accessibility. This study will in fact make it possible to determine, on the basis of the resources present in the territory, the opportunities and limits of this type of tourism.\nIn European destinations, above all, in Italy, the openness to inclusive tourism can constitute a new cycle of tourism product such as to activate that interest and curiosity that drives tourists to visit the destination. This chapter describes at first the criteria for the planning of tourism for all, and finally, in the second part, it will deal with the international policies for the realization of tourism for all.\nThe traditional model of tourist destination is characterized by tourist attractions and related infrastructure, often avoiding the local people. The resort or tourist villages are born to entertain tourists, but they did not involve local people. Nowadays the tourism and the resorts are changing, and so a lot of destinations are involving a new idea of tourism with the accomplishment of the local people that can support the persons with specials needs to live an independent travel as inhabitans.\nIt is therefore necessary to look for new models in tourism that can create a dialogue, peace and fruitful encounter between guests and the local community. This involvement, in fact, can be activated directly or indirectly \u2013 with or without the presence of the local community in all activities of tours \u2013 but always in accordance with the need of each other. Tourism for all is a new idea but is the future of tourism for different reasons: the first is that the needs of people, especially those with differences or disabilities, are increased in all parts of the world and they required the solution immediately and tailor-made; the second consists in the hypothesis that if guests can have more economic and especially technological potential, they can support and transfer their know-how to all those who suffer from that particular disorder, providing this benefit; and the third gives sustainability using the appropriate resources to enhance tourist activities.\nIn this new vision, the World Tourism Organization has attributed to tourism for all a broader vision than accessible tourism alone, combining sustainable and social tourism in a single form of tourism, including every person regardless of gender or other forms of diversity.\nIn the innovative strategy of inclusive tourism, it should be pointed out that destinations will have to develop plans and appropriate policies for sustainability and accessibility. This form of tourism, which certainly has social aims, could also be conflicting if, for example, accessibility makes use of very invasive technologies or not too much in line with the efficiency and protection of the environment. Tourism for all, therefore, becomes an ambitious project to be implemented at the local level to create a model, so valid to the global level."}, {"title": "Search strategies in accessible tourism, barrier-free tourism, disabled tourism and easy access tourism literature", "article": "Research concerning the inclusion of individuals with disabilities in tourism activities began long before this field of study was formally named.

This applies to dogs that have been individually trained by organizations or persons specializing in service dog training to perform tasks to assist a person with a disability with a need related to their disability. In recent years, the Agency has received a number of complaints from travelers regarding the transportation of other animals that provide emotional support , which typically do not have the same level of training as service dogs. To further its understanding of the considerations applicable to the transport of animals onboard the various modes of transportation, the Agency commissioned an Expert Report on the Carriage of Emotional Support Animals On Board Transportation Equipment.\nInternational Working Group on Special Service Request Codes New\nSummary Beginning in 2021, in collaboration with the National Research Council of Canada (NRC), the Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA) mobilized an International Working Group to target the current challenges associated with the use of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) Special Service Request (SSR) codes in the air travel industry. This initiative included three virtual meetings that invited a wide variety of stakeholders to discuss the various factors that may be influencing issues related to SSR codes, and work together to produce recommendations and future research. The International Working Group members included disability rights organizations and advocacy groups, airlines, airport representatives, regulators and government representatives, travel agents, ground handlers and other interested stakeholders. The International Working Group had many areas of common agreement and identified issues that require additional discussion and research. The six areas of agreement for recommendations on improving SSR codes and associated processes hold a central theme; increase passenger empowerment through raised awareness of the assistance services.\nSummary of the evidence received by the Agency on Emotional Support Animals in 2019 New\nSummary On June 25, 2020, the Canadian Transportation Agency's (CTA) new Accessible Transportation for Persons with Disabilities Regulations (ATPDR) came into force. They establish modern legally binding requirements for accessible services, technical standards for equipment, communications, training, and security and border screening. Building on these new regulations, the CTA launched public consultations on a second phase of the ATPDR, relating to requirements for small transportation service providers (TSPs), One Person, One Fare (1P1F) for international travel, emotional support animals (ESAs) and planning and reporting frameworks for TSPs under the Accessible Canada Act (ACA). On November 26, 2020, the CTA released a \"What We Heard\" report, summarizing the input received during its consultations on Phase II of its Accessible Transportation for Persons with Disabilities Regulations (ATPDR). The CTA has published the Summary of the evidence received by the Agency on ESAs in 2019 which provides a more extensive summary of the information provided during the consultations on Phase II of the ATPDR regarding ESAs.\nStudies\nInternational Air Transport Association (IATA) Guidance on the Transport of Mobility Aids New\nSummary The safe handling of mobility aids including wheelchairs has been identified as a key topic to advance air travel accessibility. Some individuals who use a mobility aid (particularly a battery-powered wheelchair or scooter), may be IATA Guidance on the Transport of Mobility Aids \u2013 First Edition, February 2023 reluctant to travel by air due to concerns of damage to their mobility aid, difficulties in stowing the aid safely in the cargo compartment, or delays associated with the return of the mobility aid to the passenger. To face these issues, in 2021, IATA launched a global Mobility Aids Action Group (MAAG) to examine and improve the transport journey of mobility aids, including wheelchairs and scooters, with the objective of improving the handling of this vital equipment for passengers with disabilities.\nMobility Aids and Air Travel Final Report\nSummary As part of its Regulatory Modernization Initiative, the CTA consulted extensively with persons with disabilities and industry, including members of its Accessibility Advisory Committee, as well as the general public, on which regulatory measures can help make the federal transportation network more accessible for persons with disabilities. Issues related to the safe storage and transportation of mobility aids on aircraft were identified as needing further examination as mobility devices have grown in size and complexity.

More about disability-related accommodation", "article": "Accommodating the needs of persons with disabilities is one of the most common human rights issues in the workplace. While the principles and concepts described above also apply here, this section highlights specific issues that employers may face when responding to requests for accommodation made by employees with disabilities.\na) General principles\nSection 17 of the Code provides that people with disabilities have the right to have their individual needs accommodated short of undue hardship, to allow them to perform the essential duties of their job. Where a person cannot perform the essential duties, even with accommodation, or where accommodation would amount to undue hardship, a decision not to employ the person would not be discriminatory. Once employers are aware of employee needs, they must take steps to meet the duty to accommodate.\nb) Identify essential duties and provide accommodation\nThe first step is to separate essential from non\u00adessential job duties. See Section IV-2b) \u2013 \u201cIdentify and clearly describe essential requirements\u201d for more information about essential job duties. If the person cannot carry out the non-essential job duties, he or she must be accommodated to do so, or these duties must be re-assigned. Accommodation must be provided to enable a person with a disability to perform the essential duties of the job, to the point of undue hardship.\nDo not reach conclusions about inability to perform essential duties without actually testing the person\u2019s ability. It is not enough to assume that the person cannot perform an essential requirement. Instead, there must be an objective determination of that fact.\nExample: An employee who works in a copy shop has limited arm movement due to a shoulder injury. The employee\u2019s job is to operate the copying equipment to fill customers\u2019 orders. Various types of copy paper are delivered by truck every week and need to be stacked and stored. Operating the copy equipment to fill orders would be an essential duty. Lifting, stacking and storing the weekly paper order is less likely to be an essential duty, since the paper delivery could be moved to a different time in the week and/or the stacking duties could be assigned to a co-worker.\nIf essential duties cannot be performed in different ways, the employer must explore other accommodation resources that may enable the person to do the essential duties. This accommodation may include adjusting the performance standard as long as doing so does not result in undue hardship.\nc) Non-evident disabilities\nThe duty to accommodate a disability exists for needs that are known. Organizations and persons responsible for accommodation are not, as a rule, expected to accommodate disabilities they are unaware of. However, some people may not be able to disclose or communicate their needs because of the nature of their disability. In such cases, employers should try to help a person who is clearly unwell or perceived to have a disability, by offering help and accommodation. This is very important if an employee is suspected of having a mental illness. On the other hand, employers are not expected to diagnose illness or \"second-guess\" the health status of an employee.\nExample: An employer is not aware of an employee's drug addiction, but perceives that a disability might exist. The employer sees that the employee is having difficulty performing, and is showing signs of distress. If the employer imposes serious sanctions or fires the employee for poor performance, without any progressive performance management and attempts to accommodate, these actions may be found to have violated the Code.\nd) How much medical information is an employer entitled to?\nEveryone is required to take part co-operatively in the accommodation process. The employer must accept accommodation requests in good faith unless there are legitimate reasons for acting otherwise. The employee must answer questions or provide information about relevant restrictions. Employers should limit requests for information to those reasonably related to the nature of limitation or restriction, to respond to accommodation requests. See also Section IV-8c) \u2013 \u201cOverview of duties and responsibilities.\u201d\nThe purpose of the questions must be carefully considered and be limited to the information that is reasonably required to assess needs and make the accommodation. The amount of information needed will depend on the circumstances. For example, it may be appropriate to ask for more information on a first absence after a sudden unexpected departure, than in the case of an absence related to an existing and known disability where the employer has already received medical information. Do not ask generally for \u201cmedical information\u201d about the employee or for a copy of the employee\u2019s medical file.\nIdeally, the employer will clearly identify what information is needed and why. For example, the employer could provide a list of questions for the doctor to answer:\nMust Susan be totally off work for six weeks, or is there some way she can continue to work with accommodation such as part-time work, flex hours, working from home, job modification, or workspace modification?\nCan Susan take part in a gradual return to work program? If so, when and how?\nHere is a physical demands analysis. Please indicate what, if anything Susan can continue to do.\nDo not design the questions in such a way that the answers will reveal the person\u2019s diagnosis. For example, an employer can ask whether accommodation is needed related to any side effects of prescribed medication, but should not ask what medications the person has been prescribed. This could, in some cases, reveal the diagnosis and is not necessary for accommodation. If the doctor provides a diagnosis or information that has not been requested, proceed very carefully and make sure that any decisions made relate to restrictions and accommodation needs rather than assumptions based on the diagnosis or other information provided.\nThe employer should then accept the information provided and make the accommodation. If the doctor\u2019s note is not clear or detailed enough to allow for this, the employer is expected to make further reasonable inquiries. For example, if a doctor\u2019s note only says that the employee is fit to return to work, follow up to clarify what accommodation, if any, is necessary.\ne) Make sure requests for doctor\u2019s notes are reasonable\nPolicies regarding doctor\u2019s notes must be reasonable and take into account that an employee may not be able to see a doctor on the same day as they are absent. In the past, the Commission has taken the position that a policy of only accepting doctor\u2019s notes dated on the date of the employee\u2019s disability-related absence is discriminatory.[60] There are also some disabilities for which there are no diagnostic tests and that can only be identified through an employee\u2019s self-report, such as chronic fatigue syndrome. In these cases, the value of having an employee obtain a doctor\u2019s note in such cases may be questionable.[61]\nWhere an employee has provided medical documentation to support future absences, a judicious and consistently applied approach to requesting doctor\u2019s notes for specific absences will serve an employer well. In cases of extended chronic illness, the employer should accept more general notes and should not require a note for each absence. If requests for doctor\u2019s notes are not necessary, are imposed differently depending on the type of disability, or have the effect of prolonging an employee\u2019s absence, such requests may be viewed as discriminatory.[62]\nExample: An employee\u2019s doctor fills in a form stating his diagnosis, chronic fatigue syndrome, and that he will need to miss four days of work per month. The employer requires the employee to get a doctor\u2019s note validating each absence before he can return to work. This is discriminatory because a doctor would only be able to repeat the employee\u2019s own views due to the nature of his disability, the requirement is not applied to employees with \u201cmainstream\u201d disabilities, and has the effect of lengthening the employee\u2019s absences.\nf) When is it appropriate to ask for a second opinion?\nWhile the employer is entitled to get all the information needed to make the accommodation, it must also accept accommodation requests in good faith and respect the dignity of employees. A request for a second opinion, an opinion from a specialist or an independent medical examination (IME) must be necessary to provide accommodation. Such a request should not be made to refute whether the employee has the disability in the first place or to avoid providing the accommodation.\nExample: An employee provides a doctor\u2019s note that asks for accommodation but does not state any particular diagnosis. The employee shows no observable symptoms of illness in the workplace, and the employer suspects that the employee is making up a disability to get more flexibility in her work arrangements. The employer wants to prove this by having the employee take an independent medical examination. Such an approach would not be consistent with the Code.\nIt is not normally advisable for an employer to second-guess the validity of an employee\u2019s doctor\u2019s advice, only on a suspicion that it is not objective because it is based on the employee\u2019s own perceptions. Avoid challenging a medical note or requiring a second opinion unless there is evidence that the doctor\u2019s recommendations are based on something other than his or her best opinion as to what is needed to make sure the patient recovers.\nThe legitimacy of a request for more medical information will depend on the information already received. A request for more medical information will be appropriate if there is a reasonable and objective basis for seeing the initial information as inadequate or inaccurate. Examples might be if there appears to be a problem with the degree of expertise or type of expertise of the doctor who provided the initial medical opinion, or if there is some reasonable basis to believe that the employee is not fit to do the job despite the existence of a medical report to the contrary. Document reasons for requesting more medical evidence.\nExample: After a serious car accident, an employee is cleared by her doctor to return to work. On more than one occasion, she becomes dizzy at the end of her 12-hour night shift operating a machine and narrowly misses hurting herself. The employer asks for more information from her doctor about possible accommodations. Once again, the doctor\u2019s note indicates that the employee is fit to work and that no accommodation steps are needed. The employer then asks the employee to attend an assessment by a doctor of her choosing, with expertise in workplace accommodations.\nIf a second opinion or independent medical exam (IME) is warranted, a good approach is to select a doctor who is acceptable to both the employee and the employer, and the union (if there is one) rather than insisting that an employee meet with a doctor that the employer has chosen. Give the employee enough information to understand the purpose of such an examination, who will conduct it and what assessments will be used.\ng) How to deal with conflicting medical reports or recommendations\nEmployers should accept medical reports in good faith. In some cases, there may be conflicting information provided by two medical experts. For example, an employee\u2019s own doctor or specialist\u2019s report may outline different accommodation needs than an independent medical examiner\u2019s report.\nDeciding which report to follow will depend on the facts of the particular situation and the following kinds of factors:\nWhat are the qualifications and degree of expertise of the two experts \u2013 which expert has more relevant experience?\nWhat is the degree of interaction with the employee? Were medical conclusions drawn based on lengthy visits over a number of months or was there only a 15-minute assessment?\nWhat methods were used for the assessment(s)?\nHow far apart are the experts\u2019 opinions?\nDo both reports equally respect the dignity and autonomy of the employee?\nWhat are the consequences of choosing one over the other?\nIf there are serious risks associated with a disability, it may be better to go with the \u201csafer\u201d accommodation. For example, one expert says the employee may have a heart attack if accommodation is not made and the other says accommodation is not necessary. It may be prudent to rely on the first opinion.\nWhat are the employee\u2019s views about the accuracy of each of the opinions based on his or her own lived experience of the disability?\nh) Considerations when contacting an employee on leave\nEmployers are entitled to contact employees on leave if it is reasonably required. For example, contact may be needed to assess accommodation requirements, the length of absence, changes in the prognosis or to find out whether there may be a potential return to work date. If an employee is off work for an \u201cundetermined\u201d amount of time, the employer can contact the employee after a reasonable length of time (for example, every 3 \u2013 6 months) to see if the prognosis has changed and whether a return to work date has been identified.\nContacts could be used to show the employee that they are missed and valued by the organization. Such contacts may show the employee that they continue to be a part of the organization and could help with a smooth return to work. On the other hand, repeated contacts requesting information, saying that the workplace needs the employee, or asking for a premature return to work (whether implicit or explicit), especially over a short period of time, may constitute harassment.\nIdeally, if possible, employers should identify early on how often and how the employee wants to be contacted. This may depend on the nature of leave requirement. For example, an employer might be asked not to contact an employee who is off due to work-related clinical depression and wants to keep this private, but may be asked to keep in touch regularly with an employee who is off for cancer treatment and wants to know about workplace events. Stigma and stereotypes, for example relating to mental illness, should not play a factor in decisions about how often to contact an employee.\nIn determining whether to contact an employee on leave, consider the following factors:\nWhat is the nature and length of the disability leave?\nWhat level of contact has the employee asked for?\nHow much time had passed since the last contact?\nWhat is the reason for the contact?\nIs more information really needed or has enough information already been provided?\nHow would a reasonable person view a further contact in light of the information above?\ni) Return to work after an extended absence due to disability\nAccommodation is a fundamental and integral part of the right to equal treatment in returning to work. Both employers and unions must co-operate in accommodating employees who are returning to work after a disability-related absence. Occupational Health and Safety committees, which include representatives of both management and labour, can help work out individual accommodations for employees with disabilities who are returning to the workplace.\nSection 17 of the Code states that the right to return to work for persons with disabilities only exists if the worker can fulfill the essential job duties after accommodation short of undue hardship. If a person cannot do the essential job duties, despite the employer's effort to accommodate short of undue hardship, there is no right to return to work. This right under the Code applies regardless of the size of the workplace or the length of time the employee has worked for the company. This is different from the corresponding provisions in the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act. See also Section II-2b) \u2013 \u201cSupremacy of the Code\u201d and Appendix B \u2013 \u201cHuman rights in the workplace: which laws?\u201d\nFor disability leave, there is no fixed rule about how long an employee with a disability may be absent before the duty to accommodate has been met. This depends on the ability of the employee to perform the essential job duties, considering the unique circumstances of every absence and the nature of the employee\u2019s condition. Also important are the predictability of absence, both in terms of when it will end and if it may recur, and the frequency of the absence. The employee\u2019s prognosis and length of absence are also important considerations. It is more likely that the duty to accommodate will continue with a better prognosis, regardless of the length of absence.\nThe duty to accommodate does not necessarily guarantee a limitless right to return to work. On the other hand, a return to work program that relies on arbitrarily selected cut-offs or requires an inflexible return date may be challenged as a violation of the Code.\nWhile an employer may be anxious to have an employee return to his or her job as soon as possible, forcing an employee to return too soon can jeopardize the successful re-integration of that employee into the workplace.[63]\nExample: An employee is told that his long-term disability benefits are ending as he has been assessed by the insurer\u2019s doctors as being able to work. Despite medical documentation from the employee\u2019s doctors showing otherwise, he is pushed back to work. This aggravates his medical condition leading to a patchy attendance record, and setting in motion a discriminatory sequence of events ending in his termination from employment.\nj) Alternative work\nThe term \"alternative work\" means different work or work that does not necessarily involve similar skills, responsibilities and compensation. Although accommodation in the pre-disability job is always preferable, it may not always be possible. The Commission has taken the position that accommodation in a job other than the pre-disability job may be appropriate in some cases.\nConsider the following questions:\nIs alternative work possible and available now or in the near future?\nIf it is not available, can a new position be created without causing undue hardship?\nDoes it require additional training and does the training impose undue hardship?\nDoes the alternative work policy contravene the collective agreement?\nWhat are the terms of the collective agreement or individual contract of employment?\nWhat are the past practices of the workplace?\nHow interchangeable are workers? Do employees often change positions either permanently or temporarily for reasons other than accommodating disability?\nAlternative work may be either temporary or permanent:\nTemporary Alternative Work: This may be appropriate either for a return to work or where a disability leaves an employee temporarily unable to perform the pre-disability job. This can also be an appropriate accommodation where the nature of the employee\u2019s disability and its limitations are temporary or episodic.\nPermanent Alternative Work: As outlined above, permanent assignment to alternative work may be appropriate in some cases. Reassignment to a vacant job should be considered an appropriate accommodation only when accommodation in the current job would cause undue hardship. The vacant position must be vacant within a reasonable amount of time. The employer does not have to \"promote\" the employee. If reassignment creates a conflict because of a collective agreement, accommodation needs should prevail over the collective agreement. When reassignment takes place, the person must be qualified for the reassigned position. The vacant position must be equivalent to the current position. If no equivalent one exists, a lower position would be acceptable. Reassignment is not available to job applicants.\nk) On-the-job drug and alcohol testing\ni) May be allowed in certain circumstances:\nThe Code's definition of \u201cdisability\u201d includes physical, psychological and mental conditions. Severe substance abuse, such as alcoholism and the abuse of legal and illicit drugs, is classified as a form of substance dependence and is a disability within the meaning of the Code. When a person's use of drugs or alcohol reaches the stage of severe abuse, addiction or dependency there may be significant impairment or distress.\nWhen a person, including a recreational alcohol or drug user, is perceived to have an addiction or dependency on drugs or alcohol, the Code operates to protect that person in the workplace. The person who had a drug or alcohol problem in the past but no longer suffers from an ongoing disability is also protected.\nThe Commission's position is that pre-employment drug and alcohol testing is generally not permitted. However, the Ontario Divisional Court has held there was no breach of the Code where an offer of safety-sensitive employment was made conditional on passing a urinalysis drug test, and the employer's policy did not provide for automatic termination on a positive drug test, but instead allowed for accommodation to the point of undue hardship.[64] See also Section IV-6d) \u2013 \u201cPre-employment drug and alcohol testing.\u201d\nDrug and alcohol testing on the job may be justifiable in certain cases. To decide whether testing is necessary, consider the following questions:\nIs there an objective basis for believing that job performance would be impaired by drug or alcohol dependency? In other words, is there a rational connection between testing and job performance?\nIs there an objective basis for believing that a specific employee\u2019s unscheduled or recurring absences from work, or habitual lateness, or inappropriate or erratic behaviour at work are related to alcoholism or drug addiction/dependency?\nIs there reason to believe that the degree, nature, scope and probability of risk resulting from alcohol or drug dependency will adversely affect the safety of other people?\nDrug and alcohol testing that is not related to job performance has been found to violate employee rights. Therefore, policies on drug and alcohol testing must not arbitrarily target groups of employees.\nExample: An employer requires only new or returning employees to be tested. This might not be justifiable in terms of the stated objectives of the testing policy.\nAs drug tests by means of urinalysis do not actually measure impairment but rather simply show the presence of drugs in the body, random drug testing of employees by urinalysis is an unjustifiable intrusion into the rights of the individual. Further, even random drug testing of oral fluid, which arguably does a better job of measuring current impairment from drugs, has been found to violate the terms of a collective agreement. As an Ontario arbitrator recently held, \"Arbitrators have concluded that to subject employees to an alcohol or drug test when there is no reasonable cause to do so, or in the absence of an accident or near miss and outside of the context of a rehabilitation plan for an employee with an acknowledged problem, is an unjustified affront to the dignity and privacy of employees which falls beyond the balancing of any legitimate employer interest, including deterrence and the enforcement of safe practices.\u201d [65]\nIn the case of random alcohol testing, the use of breathalysers is a minimally intrusive yet highly accurate measure of both consumption and actual impairment. As a result, the Commission supports the view that random alcohol testing is acceptable in safety sensitive positions, especially where staff supervision is minimal or non-existent, but only if the employer meets its duty to accommodate the needs of people who test positive.\n\u201cFor cause\u201d and \u201cpost-incident\u201d testing for either alcohol or drugs may be acceptable in specific cases. For example, after accidents or reports of dangerous behaviour, an employer will have a legitimate interest in assessing whether the employee in question had consumed substances that may have contributed to the incident. The results of the assessment may explain the cause of the accident. Such testing should only be conducted as part of a larger assessment of drug or alcohol abuse (for example, employee assistance programs (EAP), direct medical assessment and peer and supervisor reviews).\nEmployers who have determined the need for on-the-job testing should consider the following when developing on-the-job testing criteria:\nHave arrangements been made for competent handling of test samples? Qualified professionals must perform drug and alcohol testing and a competent laboratory must analyze the results. As well, the employer must make sure the samples taken are properly labelled and protected at all times. Are the test results kept confidential? To protect the confidentiality of test results, all health assessment information should stay with the examining physician and away from the employee's personnel file. Have the test results been reviewed with the employee? Procedures should be put in place for the doctor to review the test results with the employee concerned. Where mandatory self-disclosure is part of the policy, have reasonable time periods been included? Where mandatory self-disclosure is a part of a workplace drug or alcohol policy, there must be a reasonable time period within which previous substance abuse will be considered relevant to assessing current ability to perform the essential duties. The reasonable time period is based on whether the risk of relapse or recurrence is greater than the risk that a member of the general population will suffer a substance abuse problem. Mandatory self-disclosure of all previous substance dependencies, without any reasonable limitation on how long ago these conditions took place, has been found to be a prima facie violation of employee rights.[66] Have alternative methods such as functional performance testing been used? The Commission encourages employers to use methods other than drug and alcohol testing (for example, functional performance testing) where such methods exist, or develop such tests, where feasible, to assess impairment. The Commission also encourages employers to develop and put in place EAPs and peer monitoring.\nii) Duty to accommodate:\nWhere an employee tests positive, the Code requires individualized or personalized accommodation measures. Therefore, policies that result in automatic loss of employment or reassignment or that impose inflexible reinstatement conditions without regard for personal and individual circumstances are not likely to meet this requirement.[67]\niii) The employee must co-operate with the employer:\nA person who needs accommodation to perform essential job duties must make his or her needs known in enough detail and must co-operate enough to enable the person responsible to respond to the request. However, this obligation does not eliminate the employer's obligation to treat the person equally even if the employer believes or perceives (even with good reason) that the employee has a substance abuse problem.\nExample: An employee in a clerical position appears to be inebriated frequently in work hours, and the employer has a conversation with him to address the problem. The employee refuses to acknowledge the problem or seek counselling at the employer's expense. Shortly after, the employee is fired without formal warning.\nIn this case, the employer clearly \u201cperceived\u201d the person to have a substance abuse problem, and therefore the protection of the Code is engaged. The fact that a person refuses treatment or accommodation does not by itself justify immediate dismissal. The employer has to show, through progressive discipline, that the employee has been warned and is unable to perform the essential job duties. If the employee refuses offered accommodation and if progressive discipline and performance management have been implemented, then disciplinary steps can be taken.\nAn employer must provide the support needed for an employee with a drug or alcohol addiction/dependency to take part in a rehabilitation program, unless providing such accommodation would cause undue hardship. If there are objective health and safety risks associated with an employee\u2019s presence in the workplace, an employer may give the employee a paid leave to explore treatment options.\niv) Alternative programs:\nEmployers are encouraged to consider setting up such alternatives as an employee assistance program (EAP), including off\u00adsite counselling and referral services. These can be helpful, both for persons with drug or alcohol addiction/dependency, and for helping employees cope with stresses that may lead to an addiction or dependency. See also Section IV-8e(viii) \u2013 \u201cStress-related accommodation requests.\u201d Other alternatives include performance tests for safety\u00adsensitive positions where physical and/or mental co\u00adordination are essential.\nv) Last chance agreements:\nLast chance agreements are often put in place where an employee has a substance addiction and is returning to work after attending a rehabilitation program. A common element of such an agreement is that it says that employment can be terminated if there is a further relapse. This kind of agreement raises human rights concerns from a number of perspectives.\nEmployers should make sure that attempts to have employees enter into a last chance agreement do not amount to coercion or duress, as this could be a form of disability-related harassment or discrimination. Some last chance agreements may require the employee to waive any rights under human rights legislation if they breach the agreement. This type of provision could be viewed as a form of contracting out of the provisions in the Code that is not allowed. For more information about this issue, refer to Section IV-12e) \u2013 \u201cConsiderations when settling complaints internally.\u201d\nEven if all parties in a workplace, employer, union and employee, have agreed to the terms of a last chance agreement, this does not relieve the employer and union from fulfilling the Code\u2019s duty to accommodate to the point of undue hardship. The fact that an employee has not upheld his or her end of a last chance agreement is not necessarily a \u201cgreen light\u201d for termination. The employer or union would need to be sure that providing further accommodation would amount to undue hardship relating to costs, outside sources of funding and health and safety. This assessment must be done on a case-by-case basis.\nl) Harassment because of disability-related accommodation\nThe courts have clearly stated that when providing on-the-job accommodations, employees with disabilities must be treated with dignity and respect. Employees with disabilities have a right to be free from harassment. This precludes name calling and other vexatious comments, and also prohibits employers from imposing onerous or arbitrary requirements on an employee with a disability.[68]\nExample: An employee provides documentation about his disability, and yet faces a number of obstacles related to his requests for accommodation. The employer scrutinizes him for his disability-related conduct.\nm) Mental illnesses in the workplace\nMental disabilities, such as depression or schizophrenia, pose particular challenges for employers. Employees may be reluctant to seek a diagnosis and treatment or accommodation in the workplace due to stigma. Also, discrimination in the workplace may, in some cases, make existing mental illnesses worse or lead to mental disabilities such as depression or post-traumatic stress disorder.\nAs rates of mental illness increase worldwide, the impact of mental illnesses in the workplace is also growing. For example, the World Health Organization estimates that by 2020, depression will be the second-most common cause of disability in the world, after heart disease.[69] Despite this, mental illness still continues to be a taboo subject in society and in many workplaces. In this environment of silence and discomfort, stereotypes flourish unchecked and employees with mental illnesses are exposed to extreme levels of stigma and irrational fear. Employees with mental health issues often find themselves isolated and marginalized in the workplace \u2013 impacts that may be made worse by racial and cultural barriers.\nPeople with mental illnesses have the right to be employed and to receive accommodation in the workplace to the point of undue hardship. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for employees with mental disabilities to be unlawfully excluded from a hiring process, treated differently in the workplace or terminated from employment when they make a request for accommodation.\nThis is not acceptable. Under the Code, the employer must go through the same process of finding appropriate accommodation and assessing undue hardship for an employee with a mental illness as it would for an employee with any other kind of disability. A recent Ontario tribunal decision, Lane v. ADGA Group Consultants Inc[70] makes it clear that employers who do not properly accommodate the needs of employees with mental illness contravene the Code and are liable for significant damages.\ni) Case Study \u2013 How not to treat an employee with a mental illness:\nOnce he was hired, Mr. Lane told his employer of his need for accommodation and made suggestions: that his behaviour should be monitored and that if it appeared that he was going into a pre-manic phase, he might need a short time off to recover so he would not have a full manic episode (which would require him to be off for much longer). Based on the response received, he felt he had made a mistake by disclosing this information.\nSoon afterwards, the employer noted some behaviours linked to his disability as Mr. Lane was going into a pre-manic phase. Relying on stereotypes and assumptions, they leapt to the conclusion that he could not do his job, which required stability and reliability. The employer did not have any accommodation policies or procedures in place and did not assess whether it could accommodate Mr. Lane. Even if he could not be in the workplace for legitimate reasons, they didn't consider options like placing Mr. Lane on a leave while sorting out whether they could accommodate him in his position without undue hardship.\nInstead, the employer fired Mr. Lane eight days into his probationary period. No one called Mr. Lane\u2019s wife or doctor to provide support even though there were indications that he was likely in a pre-manic phase. This contributed to serious consequences \u2013 Mr. Lane developed full blown mania and depression, was hospitalized on a couple of occasions, separated from his wife (and daughter) and lost his home.\nThe complainant was awarded $80,000 (including $10,000 for mental anguish), and the employer was required to establish a comprehensive anti-discrimination policy and hire a consultant to provide training.\nii) Tips for respecting the rights of employees with mental disabilities:\nInclude input of staff and/or mental health organizations in setting organizational policy. Any policies developed should take into account the lived reality of people who have experienced mental health issues in the workplace.\nRemember that an employee with a mental disability is valued and can continue to contribute to the workplace. Focus on the person\u2019s strength, resiliency, accomplishments, and views about what he or she needs. Look at individual circumstances and don't rely on stereotypes. Recognize and take steps to alleviate stigma and vulnerability of an employee with a mental disability.\nTreat the employee the same way as employees with other kinds of disabilities, such as heart problems. Communicate professionally and responsibly as would be done for employees without mental illness. Maintain confidentiality.\nHave an open dialogue with the employee. Consider the employee's views on what will work for him or her. Find out how employee views things in the future and what they see the employer's role to be. Take instructions from the person, not third parties who claim to represent their best interests (unless there is a power of attorney). Make sure communications are clear if the employee has diagnosed or undiagnosed mental health issues. Be careful not to use language that implies negative judgements about the employee (both when speaking with the employee and when speaking about him or her to others).\nInform yourself about accommodation needs. Ask for consent and speak with the employee\u2019s doctor about accommodation needs. Don't request a diagnosis \u2013 focus on accommodation requirements. If a doctor provides a diagnosis anyway, follow up and find out what accommodation is necessary. Keep in mind that mental illnesses may be misdiagnosed and that people with mental disabilities are stigmatized. Don't focus on labels.\nDon\u2019t leap to the conclusion that undue hardship exists. Follow the same process as for employees with other disabilities. Assess health and safety risks based on objective evidence following implementation of accommodation. Make sure decisions are not being made based on stereotypes that people with mental illness are dangerous or violent.\nLook at the big picture Try to understand barriers, such as systemic racism, experienced by the employee that are aggravated by mental illness. Get information about community resources and supports.\nWork in a team to support the employee. Find out about the employee's personal support system, especially if employee is not able to fully participate in accommodation planning. Show a willingness to work together to come up with creative accommodation solutions.\niii) Availability of appropriate mental health services:\nEmployees with mental disabilities have the right to seek and get health care services targeted to their individual needs. Biased or uninformed assessments of behaviour could lead to culturally appropriate behaviour being misinterpreted as a sign of mental illness. For example, an employee may be guarded about providing personal information for reasons linked to trauma experienced in his place of origin, but this could be misinterpreted as a symptom of mental illness, such as paranoia.\nHowever, a reality is that there may not be enough service providers and health care practitioners in the region to help persons with mental health issues in languages other than English or French. This may be a barrier to an employee getting an accurate diagnosis and treatment in a timely way. An employer would need to take into account an employee\u2019s efforts to get appropriate services before concluding that an employee is not taking part in the accommodation process.\nExample: An employer asks an employee with a mental disability to attend a medical examination to identify accommodation requirements. The employee, a permanent resident from Sri Lanka, has difficulty finding a doctor, psychiatrist or psychologist who can assess him in his native language. While the employee is on the waiting list for such services, the employer provides interim accommodation based on information provided by the employee and a community organization that is assisting him. The employer relieves stress on the employee by affirming the employee's right to choose a culturally appropriate assessment and by confirming that it will wait until this can be obtained.\niv) How to support an employee\u2019s return to work after disability leave for a mental health problem:\nTo successfully support the return to work of an employee with a mental illness, Mental Health Works suggests that three fundamentals be in place:[71]\nThe work itself, and the employee\u2019s presence in the workplace, should not pose a risk to the employee or co-workers. The employee must be able to perform the tasks of his or her job at a level where meaningful work is possible with appropriate accommodations. The workplace must be welcoming and free from harassment and other pressures that might delay recovery.\nTo evaluate these, Mental Health Works recommends that an employer look at the demands of the job, and at the employee\u2019s progress, including:\nThe employee\u2019s symptoms, and the severity of those symptoms The effectiveness of treatment The employee\u2019s resilience The employee\u2019s ability to prevent a relapse (by identifying and avoiding issues that lead to relapses) The level of mental acuity and stamina the job requires.\nAs with other forms of disability accommodation, an employer is expected to first consult with the employee and to also seek input, where necessary, from his or her doctors and community resources. For more practical suggestions on reintegrating an employee into the workplace after a mental health absence, refer to the Mental Health Works website at www.mentalhealthworks.ca.\nv) Compliance with medical treatments:\nAn employee\u2019s ability to cope at work may depend on his or her compliance with a medical regime. However, an employer should be wary about acting based only on an assumption that an employee has been non-compliant or may not respond well to treatments for mental illness.\nExample: An employee provides a doctor\u2019s note that indicates that she has schizophrenia, and that she does not need any accommodation as her medical treatment has been effective to date. The employer had suspected that the employee might have depression and is shocked to hear the diagnosis (the employer is not normally entitled to know the diagnosis). The employer decides that the company cannot take the risk that the employee might not take her medicine and lets her go. This decision would likely prove to be problematic for the employer, as there was no basis to think the employee would not take her medicine, nor was there any information to suggest that there were health and safety risks to justify termination. Example: An employer notices that an employee\u2019s work performance is slipping. The employer writes a letter stating that it appears that he has not taken his medication and that he should not report to work until he is prepared to do so. The employer has not met its duty to accommodate. Example: An employer notices that an employee\u2019s work performance is slipping. The employer speaks with the employee and, with his consent, contacts his doctor to find out what accommodation needs to be provided in both the short-term and the long-term. This employer is off to a good start.\nvi) Act to overcome stigma and harassment:\nAn employer is also expected to take steps to ensure that the stigma associated with mental illness does not give rise to human rights violations. For example, discriminatory attitudes of other employees should not prevent the successful accommodation of an employee with a mental disability, nor should they be allowed to give rise to harassment or a poisoned environment. See also Section IV-12a(iv) \u2013 \u201cMobbing and Bullying.\u201d\nExample: To accommodate an employee\u2019s mental disability, an employer bundles together tasks and creates a new position in another unit. The other employees in this unit have heard this employee has a mental illness and say they are scared to work with her. The employer does not back down from implementing the most appropriate accommodation because of the discriminatory stereotypes and fears initially expressed by other staff. The employer gives them training about the duty to accommodate and the Code\u2019s protections against harassment and a poisoned environment. The employer takes steps to respond to any remaining concerns while maintaining confidentiality. The employer makes it clear that further discriminatory comment or conduct may lead to discipline. The situation is closely monitored.\nvii) Objectively assess alleged health and safety risks:\nWhere other employees claim that an employee with a mental disability poses a health and safety risk, the employer should make sure that it is able to meet the test for undue hardship before taking any action. This means that there must be objective evidence of actual risk after accommodation has been provided. Health and safety risks must not be presumed based on the stereotype that persons with mental disabilities are violent or dangerous. Without medical or other expert evidence, it would be difficult for an employer to show that the risks cannot be reduced through accommodation. When assessing risks based on medical evidence, employers should not jump to conclusions based on a diagnosis if one is provided.\nviii) Performance managing an employee who is suspected to have a mental health problem:\nAn employee with a mental health problem or disability can be successful in work given appropriate support and accommodation. While the employer is entitled to manage performance of its employees, it is to the employer\u2019s advantage to do this in a way that maintains an employee\u2019s self-esteem and encourages wellness. Mental Health Works suggests a collaborative approach to coaching distressed employees:[72]\nacknowledge the strengths that the employee brings to the team and the workplace \u2013 this sets the tone for discussions about performance\nbe clear about the changes in performance and their impacts on the organization \u2013 the employee must know what is expected\ncollaborate with the employee to set goals, objectives and timeframes\nregularly monitor the situation and evaluate progress, including by employee self-assessment, and be clear about consequences for any performance issues that remain\nrecognize and encourage the employee when goals are met, and hold the employee accountable when they are not\nboth employee and manager should be involved in determining next steps when goals have not been met.\nWhen dealing with employees who may have mental illness, employers should make sure that these employees understand the options available and the implications of any decisions they are making, in particular relating to layoffs or terminations. Employers should also be wary about rushing to terminate based on medical documentation without exploring accommodation alternatives.\nExample: An employee is acting strangely and the employer asks for a medical assessment. The doctor says that the employee is experiencing psychotic episodes. Based only on this information, the employer warns other employees to be on the alert and gives him two weeks notice of termination indicating that the employee poses a health and safety risk. The employer has not assessed the extent of any risks that may exist, has not offered or explored accommodation and may be seen to have poisoned the person\u2019s work environment.\nix) More help for employers dealing with mental health situations:\nIn the Commission\u2019s experience, employers struggle with mental health situations more than any other situation of workplace accommodation of Code-needs. The Commission recommends that employers who suspect or are aware of an employee\u2019s mental illness and are unsure about how to proceed with accommodation consult Mental Health Works. Their website address is www.www.mentalhealthworks.ca.\nMental Health Works is an organization whose mandate is to help organizations manage their duty to accommodate employees experiencing mental disabilities such as depression or anxiety in the workplace. They provide services to organizations, including workshops and presentations, and their website is an excellent online resource to help employers prevent mental health problems and support employees with mental illness. Guidance is provided on how to discuss work performance issues when an employee is suspected of having a mental illness, ways to accommodate an employee with a mental illness and how to successfully reintegrate an employee who has been on a leave as a result of a mental health problem. The website also offers a self-assessment tool called an \u201cemotional wellness survey,\u201d mental health fact sheets and information for employees.\nn) Environmental sensitivities and nut allergies\nAn emerging issue in many workplaces involves accommodating the needs of employees with environmental sensitivities and serious allergies, for example to nuts. The Commission has previously stated that these may be considered disabilities. For example, if a person with asthma, environmental sensitivity or allergies found themselves disadvantaged in the workplace as a result, that person could be considered a person with a disability under the Code. Employers may therefore have a duty to accommodate these kinds of needs.\nThis may include limiting, where possible, opportunities for workplace exposure to common substances that trigger asthma or allergies. For example, an employer may institute a \u201cscent-sensitive\u201d or \u201cscent-free\u201d workplace policy or designate the workplace as a \u201cpeanut-free zone.\u201d Depending on the workplace and the particular situation of the persons in question, there may be other appropriate accommodations. An accommodation will be appropriate to the extent that it respects the dignity of a person with a disability, takes into account individual needs, and promotes integration and inclusion of persons with disabilities. The Canadian Human Rights Commission has recently posted materials on environmental sensitivities on their website at www.chrc-ccdp.ca.\no) Learning disabilities\nThe Learning Disabilities Association of Ontario (LDAO) states that as many as 10% of people in Ontario have learning disabilities. These are invisible disabilities that affect how people process information. In the workplace, they may affect an employee\u2019s visual, auditory or organizational abilities. There is a range of accommodation steps that can be put in place to help people with learning disabilities contribute fully to the workplace.\nFor example, LDAO lists the following steps that can be taken:[73]\ngive written material or a tape recording to employees who have difficulty processing what they hear\ngive extra time and voice-recognition software to employees who have trouble writing\nbreak down tasks into smaller parts and give guidance on time frames for employees with difficulties organizing information.\nLDAO is included in the list of resources in Appendix C.\n[60] Ontario Human Rights Commission, \u201cHuman Rights Settlements Reached with Ontario Gaming and Lottery Corporation on Disability Policy,\u201d online: www.ohrc.on.ca/en/resources/news/olg_settlement.\n[61] Keays, supra note 52 (overturned on appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada).\n[62] Ibid.

Beyond a number of acknowledged barriers (e.g. cultural, architectural, relational), the main issue is the lack of coordination amongst the many actors participating in the co-creation of tourism experiences. This paper intends to advance available knowledge on this issue by conceptually suggesting a solution that draws on the concepts of the tourism experience and digital ecosystems.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020, Fabio Cassia, Paola Castellani, Chiara Rossato and Claudio Baccarani\nPublished by Emerald Publishing Limited.

Tourism experience and tourism ecosystem from perspective of tourists with mobility disability 4.1 Mapping the tourism experience through the tourism customer journey The tourism customer journey (TCJ) involves mapping the entire journey of a tourist, outlining all the stages a person goes through when experiencing the need to move for tourism purposes (\u00c5str\u00f8m, 2020). The TCJ draws on the more general concept of the customer journey, which is the \u201cprocess a customer goes through, across all stages and touch points, that makes up the customer experience\u201d (Lemon and Verhoef, 2016, p. 71). Mapping customer journeys is a popular and effective way to grasp the entire tourism customer experience (Rosenbaum et al., 2017). If the tourism product as a whole was offered by one single company, the general customer journey concept could be easily applied to tourism in the same way as it is applied to other kinds of services (e.g. banking, retail and insurance services). However, as will be discussed shortly, tourism is a more complex service because of the number and variety of co-creating actors and the relationships amongst them. Here, we apply the TCJ to the context of people with mobility disability. A similar analysis could be applied to people with other disabilities (Al\u00e9n et al., 2012), resulting in different and specific types of TCJs. Given the complexity of applying a contextual study to all types of disabilities, this study focusses only on people with mobility disability, but the same method of analysis could be easily extended and replicated. From the very beginning of the TCJ, even when individuals are planning their holiday, they will encounter a series of actors, whose number will dramatically increase in the subsequent stages of the journey (Buhalis, 2000; Saraniemi and Kyl\u00e4nen, 2011). This is because tourism involves a complex ecosystem that has many actors who influence to a greater or lesser extent the experience perceived by individuals during their journey (Gretzel et al., 2016). The quality delivered by each actor clearly influences the overall quality of the tourist's overall experience (Ciasullo, 2017). Sometimes this phenomenon is emphasised because the quality performance of one provider has a spillover effect on the customer's evaluation of the quality performance of other components of (or actors in) the tourism ecosystem (Bourdeau et al., 2007). That is, a negative performance in one part of the journey may have a negative halo effect on the entire journey, considering that the tourist (beyond being the focal actor of the ecosystem) (Storbacka et al., 2016) is the only actor to see all the components of the ecosystem. Similarly, a positive performance in one of the moments of truth (Normann, 2001) has the potential to compensate for a series of negative performances in other parts of the journey. Overall, there is a remarkable risk of tourist dissatisfaction, which is heightened when the person undertaking the journey has some form of disabilities, such as when they have reduced mobility. These arguments can be illustrated through the construction of the TCJ for a holiday that is independently conceived and designed by a person with mobility disability who has time to spend in a destination to be selected and does not want to rely on standardised offerings delivered by tour operators. For this purpose, we draw on the general framework suggested by Baccarani and Cassia (2017), according to which a holiday is articulated and occurs in the following four main stages (Figure 1): destination choice and trip design; outbound trip; staying at the destination; transfer to another destination or return home. Each of the four stages of the TCJ develops through the processes that are outlined below. The points marked with the sign (*) in the following list represent critical aspects for people with mobility disability because they can entail various problems related to accessibility because of the presence of architectural, communication, cultural, technological and relational barriers. The first stage of the TCJ \u2013 destination choice and trip design \u2013 encompasses the formation of a tourist's experiential expectations drawing on the following elements: time available for the journey, motivations triggering the need for the journey, any previous personal holiday experiences, any previous indirect holiday experiences (e.g. information collected online, online reviews and e-word-of-mouth), dialogue and interactions with disability organisations and associations, information available online or printed specialised magazines and publications, information available in promotional materials delivered by tourism destinations, means of transportation available and reservation of such transportation (*), type of accommodations available and reservation of such lodgings (*), definition of a hierarchy of suitable destinations (*). The second stage of the TCJ \u2013 outbound trip \u2013 covers the most complex part of the holiday. In fact, the anticipated benefits of the planned holiday take shape during this stage. In the case that the tourist uses a personally owned means of transport suitable for their disability to reach the boarding point and that the travel is done by aeroplane, this stage includes the following elements: printing the boarding pass, estimating the time that they must leave home to reach the airport (this estimation is informed by customers' sensitivity to risk and the information available), preparing their luggage, planning which road or highways to take to reach the airport, stopping at rest areas to meet their needs or the needs of others or to comply with the requirements of the transport providers (*), parking in an area near the airport (*), checking in their luggage (*), reaching the boarding point (*), complying with any safety control procedures (*), waiting at a boarding gate (*), boarding the aeroplane (*), flying to the destination (*), disembarking and claiming their luggage (*), searching for a local means of transport to reach the accommodation facility (*), arriving and being welcomed at the accommodation facility (*). The third stage of the TCJ \u2013 staying at the destination \u2013 represents the core of the holiday with all that a person desired for their time away on holiday. This is a stage of personal enhancement in relation to seeking knowledge, values and relationships. During this stage, the core value of the holiday emerges and is influenced, at least in the beginning, by the travel experience, which may increase or diminish the initial enthusiasm. This stage encompasses the following points and involves a variety of actors at the destination: planning itineraries, visits and activities that the tourists wish to engage in at the destination based on their previous knowledge and the information available to them, visiting cultural, artistic and natural sites in an area (*), forming relationships with the host community (*), selecting from a variety of foods and eateries on offer (*), participating in local guided tours (e.g. wine tours) (*), using local means of transport (*), purchasing souvenirs. The fourth stage of the TCJ \u2013 transfer to another place or return back home \u2013 is similar to stages two and three described above, and includes the overall evaluation of the perceived quality in relation to the expected quality developed in stage one. In addition to the steps described above, which imply a variety of relationships between the tourist and several different actors, the context of a holiday is even more complex because tourist safety and care must be specifically assured, particularly for PwD. These conditions must be guaranteed by higher-level welfare systems, with which the tourism service network should be able to cooperate effectively. In summary, in this TCJ the tourist benefits from a variety of services that globally support the creation of the tourism experience, which is phenomenologically determined and perceived by the beneficiary (i.e. the tourist) (Vargo and Lusch, 2016). 4.2 Identifying the tourism ecosystem in relation to tourists with mobility disability This subsection identifies the actors that form the complex tourism ecosystem in its co-creation of the tourism experience. During each of the four stages of the TCJ, many different actors contribute to the formation of the overall tourist experience by delivering or not delivering the expected quality. In the tourist's experience, all these actors form a tourism service ecosystem, even if they represent only a set of services that the customer has assembled (Baccarani and Cassia, 2017). In fact, a service ecosystem implies a self-contained, self-adjusting system of resource-integrating actors connected by shared institutional arrangements and mutual value creation (Vargo and Lusch, 2016). However, this level of coordination amongst all the actors involved in the co-creation of tourism experience does not yet exist. Below, we outline the actors involved in each of the four stages of the TCJ. In the first stage, the tourist imagines, designs, plans and anticipates the pleasure of their holiday. To complete this stage, the tourist relies on the information provided by actors such as airlines and accommodation providers and interact with them directly or through intermediaries. For people with mobility disability, the dialogue and interactions with disability organisations and associations play an important role. As highlighted by the UNWTO, disabled peoples' organisations (DPOs) play a key role in accessible tourism because \u201cthey are mediators in understanding specific needs, existent barriers and the ways to bridge them\u201d (UNWTO, 2020). At this first stage of the TCJ (destination choice and trip design), quality is evaluated on the basis of the completeness and clarity of the information provided by multiple actors. All the actors involved in this first stage of the TCJ represent the holiday-design ecosystem (see Figure 3). In the second stage of the TCJ (outbound trip), at least the following 12 actors are involved, and this number could be even higher if a tourist decides to use public means of transport (instead of a personally owned means on transport): producers of publications or websites and intermediaries distributing information that guides the tourist in selecting the destination during the season in which the journey takes place; booking organisations through their websites; transport providers, including those preparing the service timetable; highways operators who have information about roadworks and any related delays; firms executing the roadworks who have information about any interruptions that may affect the roadworks and travel times; firms managing the rest areas and a variety of other services that may be required; firms managing the parking areas who may assist customers to reach their boarding point after having parked their vehicle; airport company that manages the departure airport that offers a welcome service and controls safety processes; airline that is responsible for checking in passengers, assigning boarding gates, flying times and delivering baggage; airport company that manages the arrival airport that offers welcome services and provides information to customers and about local means of transport; local transport service operators; accommodation services providers. Therefore, a tourist interacts with at least 12 different co-creating actors during the second stage of the TCJ. These actors are connected in the tourist's mind but they are practically linked only through market relations and they do not coordinate their decisions and behaviours. Thus, it is unlikely that the tourist will be able to complete the second stage without experiencing some level of difficulty. For example, the tourist may miss the flight because of planned roadwork not being properly notified in advance or because of other unforeseen events. To evaluate the quality of the overall experience, the tourist considers all the components of this stage of the TCJ, comparing expected and actual quality. In particular, the tourist will appreciate the problem-solving capability of the actors. This second group of actors represents the travel ecosystem (see Figure 3). In the third stage of the TCJ (staying at the destination), the tourist stays at the chosen destination where they interact with at least the following actors: firms who manage welcome and accommodation services; restaurateurs; local inhabitants (local community); local transport service operators; local merchants with their value propositions; agencies who organise local tours so that customers can explore local traditions, culture and products; municipalities; organisations protecting tourists' safety and care. This third stage of the TCJ has fewer actors than the second stage. However, the variety of actors is greater because during the tourist's stay at the destination, the tourist will engage in activities such as trying different types of food offerings to appreciate the local food culture, which means they will have contact and engage with more actors. Similarly, to explore local artistic, natural and cultural heritage, the tourist will select from a variety of opportunities that are available at the destination. In the third stage of the TCJ, the local community also plays a fundamental role in welcoming tourists and in co-creating their tourism experiences. In fact, in addition to the technical and functional\u2013relational components of the quality delivered by local services (Gr\u00f6nroos, 1990; Kang and James, 2004), the welcoming atmosphere experienced at the destination plays a central role in the formation of the overall perceived quality (Nunkoo and Ramkissoon, 2011). All the actors involved in the third stage of the TCJ represent the staying at destination ecosystem (see Figure 3). The fourth stage (transfer to another place or return back home) is a replication of the stages two and three outlined above and encompasses the tourist's comparison between the overall perceived quality and the expected quality developed in stage one. The actors that populate the tourism service ecosystem are largely the same for tourists with and without disabilities. However, tourists with disabilities can select amongst a smaller number of offerings than tourists without disabilities. Moreover, actors are required to have adequate technical and relational skills to deliver tourism services to tourists with disabilities. Thus, tourists with disabilities must face greater difficulties in their travel-related choices because of the presence of several types of barriers (see Figure 2). The tourism ecosystem described in this sub-section is depicted in Figure 3. The quality of the tourism experience emerges from the relationships established within this tourism ecosystem through which resources are combined and value is co-created. Such relationships have different degrees of smoothness depending on the presence of several barriers.\n5. Barriers to accessible tourism: can digital ecosystems represent a solution? Drawing on the arguments developed so far, this section identifies in detail the barriers to fulfilling tourism experience co-creation for PwD. The intention of the discussion is to understand whether and how digital ecosystems could represent a viable solution to such barriers. The identified relationships amongst the co-creating actors have not been harmonised to deliver the overall quality desired by the tourist because they are regulated by pure competitive mechanisms, emphasising the value of a specific part of the ecosystem instead of the value of the entire ecosystem. However, in tourism, competition amongst companies of the same sector can exist only once a territory as a whole is attractive. As highlighted in several studies (Baccarani et al., 2019; Barnes, 2004), the territory is not a physical space, but a highly complex viable subject emerging from all co-creations over time through the interactions between nature and human beings. Thus, the territory emerges from the relational synergies between the people who inhabit it and the environment. Therefore, the stronger the synergies established in a certain location, the higher the location's attractiveness and value, which then make the location a platform in which individual actors can compete against each other with their propositions. That is, the long-term attractiveness of a territory and of a tourism destination derives from the actions of the entire ecosystem, within which the actors must aim to do their best through a continuous dialogue with the territorial ecosystem. For this purpose, tourism must be conceived in a holistic manner by deploying planning efforts that involve all the actors of the ecosystem and engage all the potential beneficiaries of the tourism offering \u2013 be they are tourists with or without disabilities (Darcy et al., 2020). This perspective cannot ignore a series of barriers that determine biases in the co-creation of a location that provides tourism services for all tourists and particularly for those with mobility disability. In detail, the following barriers to accessible tourism can be identified (Gillovic et al., 2018; Michopoulou et al., 2020; Nyanjom et al., 2018): informational barriers; architectural barriers; political barriers; cultural barriers; relational barriers; technological barriers; entrepreneurial myopia. These barriers are outlined below from the perspective of PwD. Informational barriers refer to the difficulties that a person with disabilities faces when desiring to autonomously evaluate and choose a means of transport, accommodation, a holiday itinerary or simple holiday activities such as shopping. While there is usually a great deal of information is available for such services, informational needs of PwD leads to higher levels of complexity. For example, even when information about tourism services is available it can difficult to verify. Architectural barriers refer to the obstacles PwD encounter on holiday when engaging in activities such as accessing means of transport, moving in different locations, and using sidewalks and roads. Inconveniences related to architectural barriers can often also be experienced by people without disabilities (e.g. finding it difficult to understand the subway system) but the barriers are emphasised for PwD. Architectural barriers are directly connected to political barriers, which refer to the needs of PwD in the context of a political agenda. While political discourses highlight the ideal of acting to eliminate architectural barriers, political actions are often guided by urgency, short-termism and narrow-sighted electoral benefits. Cultural barriers refer to the indifference that can characterise the behaviour of all people of all abilities (Gillovic et al., 2018) towards PwD. This barrier is manifest in factors such as the lack of respect for PwD parking slots. Relational barriers refer to the general population viewing PwD from a self-righteous perspective, believing that the PwD cannot live a full life, even within the constraints of the experienced impairments. Technological barriers refer to the speed of the technological change related to means of transport and communication, which can create difficult situations for those who do not keep up with the ongoing changes. Entrepreneurial myopia refers to the inability to appreciate the size and value of the tourism market for PwD and of changes occurring in public opinion. This myopia is in tension with the ideals of sustainability provided by Agenda 2030 (United Nations, 2015), which explicitly highlights the need to promote sustainability and inclusivity and to empower PwD (e.g. points 11 and 23 of Agenda 2030) and by the Global Code of Ethics for Tourism (UNWTO, 2001), which states the \u201cright to tourism\u201d (article 7). When accessible tourism experiences are designed, it is important to avoid ad-hoc solutions aimed exclusively at PwD (Scheyvens and Biddulph, 2018). Following the principles of universal design (Michopoulou et al., 2020), tourism providers should in fact enable experiences that are useable by all people, with or without disabilities. This approach is consistent with the idea that tourism carries a value that makes it a public service, interpreted as a service that should be assured for every member of communities that desire such services. The question now arises of the assessment of the potential of digital ecosystems to remove the identified barriers and enable effective accessible tourism experience co-creation. While it is clear that technology cannot solve all the problems, we contend that it represents a valuable engine for such effective co-creation. As noted by Akaka and Vargo (2014), technology should be conceived as an operant resource able to bring about changes in ecosystems and influence value co-creation processes. The provision of a platform to support the engagement of actors involved in accessible tourism can thus represent a first step to first removing informational and relational barriers, and over time, smoothening other barriers (e.g. cultural barriers). Thus, technology can enable the emergence of a digital ecosystem with tourists and their needs as the focal actors (Gretzel et al., 2015, 2016). Such an ecosystem could initially organise and coordinate suitable solutions to emerging PwD needs and issues by collecting and sharing the information concerning all the actors of the ecosystem. Given that tourism is a service provided by a specific territory, the digital ecosystem should be led by the authorities in charge at the territorial level, whether a municipality, province, region or country. Given that the emerging ecosystems require rapid efficiency and effectiveness checks, it seems more appropriate that the process begins at the local territorial level and then extended (through imitation and adaptations) to higher levels. Beyond authorities in charge at the territorial level, universities and other research institutes should play a central role in the design of a tourism ecosystem. These institutions should establish a dialogue with tourists, with PwD and with disability organisations and associations, without overlooking local inhabitants who are important for creating a warm and smooth welcoming. The emergence of the tourism ecosystem also draws on the constructive contributions of all the organisations representing the service providers who play a role in co-creating tourism experiences. The digital ecosystem should also be based on a series of incentives for firms that decide to be a part of the ecosystem, beyond a process of certification and evaluation of their delivered quality. As a good starting point, municipalities could establish tourism departments that have the additional responsibility for the removal of mobility barriers. The viability of this choice is demonstrated by the experience of Verona, the first (and currently the only) municipality in Italy that has introduced such a department. For smaller municipalities, the digital ecosystem could be created at a higher level, such as in a consortium of municipalities, a province or a region. Figure 2 presents the main features of the tourism digital ecosystem. Overall, the establishment of a digital ecosystem aims to make the territory an inclusive, warm and welcoming location where people want to live or stay. Hence, by providing an engagement platform, technology can act as an operant resource, disrupting the myopia guiding each actor's individual behaviours. An example of a digital ecosystem to support accessible tourism is the one being implemented by Explora, the destination management organisation of the Lombardy region (Italy). Explora has begun to establish a digital ecosystem (Ecosistema Digitale Turistico della Lombardia) through a platform that aims to support information sharing amongst the actors of Lombardy's tourism ecosystem. This ecosystem has not been created specifically to support accessible tourism. However, through this platform, operators could coordinate and harmonise the design of accessible tourism experiences, which would then be communicated and sold through the related web portal \u201cin-lombardia.it\u201d. This web portal currently hosts dozens of accessible tourism experiences; however, these are not conceived following the concept of the holistic ecosystem described in this paper. Nonetheless, the technological infrastructure that has been created has the ability to foster the future emergence of such a holistic accessible tourism ecosystem."}, {"title": "Universal Design Guide for Inclusive Tourism by Scott and Sarah Pruett", "article": "\u201cInclusive tourism is a global movement to ensure the full social participation of all persons with disabilities in travel, citizenships, and cultural contribution \u2013 and in the process, to ensure the same for everyone else.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Scott Rains , srains@oco.net www.RollingRains.com For more on the Pruetts see: Universal Design Partners https://universaldesign.org/"}, {"title": "Accessible tourism futures: the world we dream to live in and the opportunities we hope to have", "article": "The paper\u2019s examination of the concepts and global policy considerations provides a strong academic and practitioner foundation for considering accessible tourism futures.

The special issue explores theoretical approaches, foundations and issues in the study of accessible tourism from a futures perspective. Accessible tourism, as with any area of academic study is an evolving field of academic research and industry practice, set within a dynamic social context. The field is interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary, and is influenced by geography, ageing and disability studies, economics, public policy, psychology, law, architecture, construction sciences, technology and marketing. Past research has attempted to view, explain and unpack the inherent complexities (Darcy, 2010) within accessible tourism through a variety of lenses, including human rights, critical tourism, embodiment, customer segmentation and universal design (UD), to name a few (see Buhalis and Darcy, 2011; Buhalis et al., 2012). The special issue is timely given the operationalisation of the United Nations (2006) Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities by 160 countries. Central to the convention is the right for tourists with disability to access transport and built environment in Article 9 and tourism experiences, goods and services within Article 30. It is therefore pertinent to look at the future of accessible tourism and contemplate a number of issues including (but not limited to) the role of technology in reshaping disability; if and how policy makers and planners are addressing the impact of accessible tourism in a sustainable manner; the political influence of people with disabilities, who make up the largest minority group in the USA, on the future of tourism; the science fiction of exoskeletons and gene therapy as a new form of adventure tourist; and the future state of embodied identity and accessible tourism. The special issue provides the opportunity for contributors to take part in the current discourses on accessible tourism from a futures perspective, in order that we can understand, manage and contribute to the development of accessible tourism in the context of economically, socially and environmentally sustainable communities. Specific topics included conceptual and research papers, viewpoints and trend papers, both qualitative and quantitative, discussing topics relating to the future of accessible tourism. Papers include a range of issues including: inclusive destinations; accessible tourism in Development Planning (toward the UN Sustainable Development Goals 2030); policy-making for accessible tourism; embodiment; representation; law and legislation; architecture and universal design; inclusion/exclusion from experiences; markets and needs analysis; accessible transport; accessible events; accessibility and culture/heritage; accessible accommodation; education/training; and technology and applications. In contrast to the past 30 years, where disability and tourism research has been largely concerned with overcoming barriers that exclude certain people (see Smith, 1987), we can discern the contours of new movements in accessible tourism, whereby overarching principles and standards of sustainability, social responsibility and customer service. The delivery of equitable tourism experiences demand the attention of sector actors and stakeholders. Accessible tourism, in this context, should be seen in the future as much more than a range of supports to excluded target groups, becoming a set of ground rules and codes of practice which contribute to the development of all tourism offers and destinations in an inclusive way. If we should gaze into the crystal ball for a moment, we could envisage that tourism will not be defined primarily in terms of different target groups, since principles of responsibility, sustainability and accessibility will in the future inform the quality criteria to which all destinations should comply and be judged as part of destination competitiveness in increasingly global context. Customers will become more aware of their individual rights and also the need to protect and sustain communities and the natural environment, influencing tourism service providers to follow generally accepted rules of service quality, genuine interactivity and engagement with the local culture, people and resources. The capability of tourism providers to recognise those rights for all (e.g. of tourists with disabilities, Design for All, responsible behaviour, inclusion of the local communities in a transparent system of remuneration and participation, working opportunities for socially excluded group etc.) is going to be the threshold, which determines whether their offers will succeed or fail in the future. The tourism sector will increasingly be seen as having transformational power as \u201ca shaper of society\u201d, acting as a promoter of jobs and economic growth, a participant in regional and community planning and a partner in global development programmes. In addition, tourism should be developed as industry that promotes understanding, inclusion and well-being for all in an equitable way. Businesses, destinations and networks, that are already active in the field of accessible tourism and/or representing markets with different specific requirements will participate more widely in the mainstream, bringing their expertise and knowledge to bear on all those issues that are still seen as \u201cdifferent types of tourism\u201d. In the development of accessible destinations and experiences, the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (2015) will be playing an increasingly supportive role, especially through its Global Code for Ethics in Tourism and the recently published Manuals on Accessible Tourism (2015), produced by ONCE Foundation and the European Network for Accessible Tourism (2015b). Before discussing the papers that have been selected for publication we would like to set the scene by examining some major conceptual and policy development areas that we believe will have a significant influence on accessible tourism futures in the future. These include: dreams and aspirations of people with disability; demography; UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; destination competitiveness frameworks; UD; and the newly adopted UN Sustainable Development Goals for 2030. Each of these areas of influence will now be outlined prior to the papers for the special edition being summarised for their contribution to the future of accessible tourism.\nDefining and conceptualising accessible tourism Conceptualising accessible tourism to reflect all its dimensions and multidisciplinarity is critical for the future. The study of tourism and disability has been a reasonably recent phenomenon with the first detailed examination emerging from the leisure constraints literature (Smith, 1987). From this beginning, a great deal of individual studies are emerged that documented significant issues with demand, supply and coordination of travel for people with disability. More recently the field has started to mature with a conceptualisation that has sought to make sense out of the individual studies and provide an overall framework for understanding the phenomena. To assist with this conceptualisation, Buhalis and Darcy (2011) offer the following definition: Accessible tourism is a form of tourism that involves collaborative processes between stakeholders that enables people with access requirements, including mobility, vision, hearing and cognitive dimensions of access, to function independently and with equity and dignity through the delivery of universally designed tourism products, services and environments. This definition adopts a whole of life approach where people through their lifespan benefit from accessible tourism provision. These include people with permanent and temporary disabilities, seniors, obese, families with young children and those working in safer and more socially sustainably designed environments (adapted from Darcy and Dickson, 2009, p. 34 in Buhalis and Darcy, 2011, pp. 10-11). Importantly the definition recognises collaboration between stakeholders across demand, supply and coordination to recognise that disability is a complex construct involving mobility, vision, hearing, cognitive and other embodiments. The definition recognises that developing inclusive destinations and accessible tourism experiences also benefit other groups in the community. Hence, it contributes toward a greater social sustainability of the industry by including and, hence, providing for a much broader cross-section of consumers that has previously been considered by the industry. In understanding the importance of individuals with disability, the stakeholders they engage with and the influence of UD on the products, services and environments they wish to seek enabling experiences. Buhalis and Darcy (2011) suggests that to develop accessible tourism futures destination managers must strategically plan through the lens of UD. Figure 1 outlines the cyclical strategic approach to engaging UD approaches across disability and lifespan considerations as a foundation for developing future accessible destination experiences.\nDreams and aspirations of people with disability The dreams and aspirations of individuals play a fundamental role in shaping the choices, which lead them to travel. Among people who live with a disability, the idea of leaving behind one\u2019s everyday surroundings and going on a journey can create significant anxiety (Darcy, 1998). People with disability often can design or influence their everyday environment whilst they have routines to negotiate any difficulties and thresholds that exist. This does not apply to new environments whilst travelling, where they do not have prior knowledge, networks or influence on the design nor the potential barriers that are to face and the way to overcome them. Indeed, a recent European survey (GfK, 2015) suggests that up to half of people with disability do not travel on holiday, due to a combination of lack of reliable information, lack of funds and previous bad experiences. Yet, the desire to travel remains with studies showing that it is not a person\u2019s impairment that impedes their travel but a series of interpersonal, attitudinal structural constraints (Daniels et al., 2005; Darcy, 2003). In recognising that a person's impairment does not constrain their travel motivations, the boundaries to what is regarded as accessible tourism destinations and experiences are continually pushed by the accessible explorers who forge new pathways for others to follow.\nMillennium development goals (MDGs) and the UN global compact At the Millennium Summit in September 2000 the largest gathering of world leaders in history adopted the UN Millennium Declaration, committing their nations to a global partnership to reduce extreme poverty and setting a series of targets, with a deadline of 2015. These targets, known as the MDGs are a set of eight specific goals set by the 191 United Nations member countries that have the goal of halving world poverty by the year 2015: Eradicating extreme poverty continues to be one of the main challenges of our time, and is a major concern of the international community. Ending this scourge will require the combined efforts of all, governments, civil society organizations and the private sector, in the context of a stronger and more effective global partnership for development. The Millennium Development Goals set timebound targets, by which progress in reducing income poverty, hunger, disease, lack of adequate shelter and exclusion \u2013 while promoting gender equality, health, education and environmental sustainability \u2013 can be measured. They also embody basic human rights \u2013 the rights of each person on the planet to health, education, shelter and security. The Goals are ambitious but feasible and, together with the comprehensive United Nations development agenda, set the course for the world\u2019s efforts to alleviate extreme poverty by 2015 (United Nations Secretary-General BAN Ki-moon). The aim of the MDGs is to encourage development by improving social and economic conditions in the world\u2019s poorest countries. Since the MDG\u2019s were agreed to significant progress has been made. To date average overall incomes have increased by approximately 21 per cent. The number of people living in extreme poverty declined by an estimated 130 million. Chile mortality rates fell from 103 deaths per 1,000 live births a year to 88. Life expectancy rose from 63 years to 65 years. An additional 8 per cent of the developing world\u2019s people received access to clean water and an additional 15 per cent acquired access to improved sanitation services. In 2015 the UN countries will adopt a new sustainable development agenda and a new global agreement on climate change. The actions taken in 2015 are expected to result in new sustainable development goals that build on the eight MDG\u2019s (United Nations, 2015). Tourism has long been seen as having significant potential to help achieve the MDG\u2019s in developing countries. For example in 1990 developing countries had 18 per cent of international tourism receipts. By 2005 this had risen to 30 per cent and to date it continues to rise. There has been significant promotion of the direct economic links between tourists and the poor. Tourism may provide employment opportunities for marginalised groups, may bring direct income to individual communities and may promote equality in developing countries (Saarinen and Rogerson, 2013).\nUD supports destination competitiveness The tourism industry needs to design and deliver offerings and services that are suitable to all potential users and remove any physical or organisational barriers that can prevent visitation. UD incorporates the accessibility requirements of people with the widest possible range of abilities, so that the greatest number of people can use mainstream products and services without the need for adaptations or special interfaces. Additionally, mainstream products and services should use interface standards which match those of technical aids, so allowing disabled people to access and use mainstream equipment. UD has been defined as: Universal design is the design of products and environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design. The intent of the universal design concept is to simplify life for everyone by making products, communications, and the built environment more usable by more people at little or no extra cost. The universal design concept targets all people of all ages, sizes and abilities\u2019. The Universal Design approach goes beyond traditional design, which tends to focus on the \u2018average\u2019 user. Universal Design is a design approach, reflecting a way of understanding people\u2019s needs. It is not a list of particular solutions, measurements, or products \u2013 Universal Design is the way to reach the solution, contributing to social inclusion (cited in Center for Universal Design, 2009; and first articulated by Mace, 1985). Applying the principles of UD can be seen as a way of developing tourism environments, transportation, services and offers, underpinning sustainable communities and businesses. Today, according to a recent study by European Network for Accessible Tourism (2015a) and partners, less than 10 per cent of tourism suppliers in Europe offer \u201caccessible\u201d tourism services, while demand for such services is set to increase due to the ageing population and continuing upward trend in market demand. Adopting UD enlarges the target markets of destinations as well as ensures that more pleasant experiences can be delivered. Therefore it can increase the market base, reduce seasonality and support the competitiveness of destinations (Buhalis, 2000). Yet, few studies have examined accessible tourism in relation to destination management and only recently has accessible tourism been examined from destination competitiveness perspective (Dom\u00ednguez Vila et al., 2015).\nPapers in this issue To address these concepts and developments this special issue is bringing a range of papers together that discuss research on many accessibility tourism aspects. Naniopoulos and Tsalis (2015) discuss a methodology for addressing the accessibility of monuments. They focus on heritage attraction sites, highlighting the challenges with archaeological sites where interventions become problematic or even impossible. In doing so, they approached accessibility as a dual notion; accessibility of an area and its potential for independent physical access and movement around the monuments as well as perceived accessibility in terms of interpreting, understanding and learning from the environment. The methodology was applied to a number of byzantine monuments as part of a cultural route in the city of Thessaloniki in Greece, as case studies. Results provide both tools for assessing monument accessibility (process orientations and checklists) and insights into the needs of travellers with disabilities for more \u201cusable\u201d heritage attractions. Concluding remarks place a focus on the prerequisites of training and cooperation to allow for the future of accessible monuments to be realised. Tsalis et al. (2015) provide an interesting study on the challenges of implementing accessibility solutions, also within the context of protection, conservation, and management of historical centres and monuments. Viewed from a tourism perspective, archaeological sites and monuments are location bound and exist only in their original place. Hence, access to such sites enables unique and authentic tourism experiences. Discourses on objective, constructive and existential authenticity are of paramount importance when accessibility is concerned. This study provides relevant examples of accessibility interventions on six monuments as well as considerations on the design of the tools that assisted site interpretation and interconnection in a cultural route. Results demonstrate how accessibility improvements can occur while respecting the history, architecture and character of the monuments. The study concludes by emphasizing that it is primarily through providing greater access, that the \u201csocialisation\u201d of these monuments will propagate authentic tourism experiences in the future. Bowtell (2015) offers an examination of the market value and attractiveness of accessible tourism in Europe. Historic data were used to provide a forecast for 2025, while primary data obtained from travel and leisure companies provided insights into managerial perceptions. Findings show a very promising potential for accessible tourism market with significant projected revenues. However, a number of challenges including lack of awareness, cost of investments, complexity of customers\u2019 needs and legal inconsistencies within the EU, create barriers toward developing comprehensive solutions for accessible tourism. Authors provide recommendations on bridging demand and supply. Gillovic and McIntosh (2015) present an interesting study on stakeholder perspectives of the future of accessible tourism in New Zealand. The study provides insights into the current situation and the future propensity for an accessible tourism industry in New Zealand. A number of interviews with key stakeholders revealed that there is a need to develop a culture of accessibility that is perceived as the norm. Findings also include the business and demand arguments, but additionally highlighted the \u201cineptness\u201d of upper industry levels to recognize the opportunity of accessible tourism, exhibiting apathy and complacency instead. Authors conclude with recommendations for the future of accessible tourism in New Zealand which can easily be generalised for other regions. Zajadacz (2015) discusses the evolution of models of disability as a basis for the future development of accessible tourism. A review of medical, social, biopsychosocial, geographical and economic models of disability reveals the theoretical underpinnings and assumptions entailed in those. These are then linked to tourism, demonstrating that different models influence the tourism provision in terms of both products and services. Authors highlight the understanding of disability under different models toward diverse tourism experiences. Several suggestions are offered on the complementary of the models and the implications on the transformation of the accessible tourism industry in the future. Cruces Portales (2015) uses a scenario planning approach to envisage alternative futures for accessible tourism. With a timeframe leading to 2050, four alternative futures are unravelled through storytelling. The scenarios are built on a matrix that includes the opposing forces of empathy \u2013 apathy, and fear of loss and certainty of benefits. The resulting, aptly named scenarios (Eden Gardens, Golden Bridge, Wasted Future and State of Hope) showcase different behaviours, schedules of changes and insights. Authors conclude with strategic ideas and proposals for the future of accessible tourism.\nConclusion When exploring the future of tourism in this area two opposing trends can be observed: future societies are predicted to become more similar, more homogenous as a consequence of consumerism, globalisation and converging urban lifestyles. However, the accessible tourism market is characteristically diverse, with complex needs and the range of dreams and ambitions is boundless. Will future global travellers be able to access more varied and personal services or will increasing numbers of travellers give rise to greater standardization of services? Accessible tourism as an emerging field of study will influence tourism destination competitiveness in the future, whether that be from a human rights, emerging market segment or service delivery perspective. In this conceptual examination, we have presented implications of number of theoretical constructs and lenses through which accessible tourism will be influenced in the future. In this special issue, a number of future dimensions are explored that demonstrate how the field has moved from an examination of the intersection of disability and tourism, to one that is clearly defined through conceptual and definitional approaches as accessible tourism. There is a common thread amongst all the papers presented in this special issue. They focus around stakeholder collaboration, as a foundation for the future development of accessible tourism. It has been explicitly suggested that raising awareness amongst stakeholders is essential to overcome barriers inhibiting the application of solutions that enhance access. The importance of stakeholder collaboration across the accessible tourism value chain has been emphasized in a number of ways in this special issue. Improving accessibility of facilities, transportation, attractions and destinations more generally, demands the collaboration of a wide range of stakeholders including architects, designers, economists, local councils, policy makers, travellers with disabilities, historians and archaeologists to name a few. Therefore \u201csocialising\u201d tourism means that access can be granted only when a number of relevant stakeholders are in accord, work together and specifically developed strategies to target the accessible tourism market. Stakeholder collaboration is a key factor for developing accessible tourism solutions, recognising the value of the market and capitalising on it. Hence, a collaborative approach is required to recognise the complementary nature of the different paradigms; to re-shape and transform the future of the accessible tourism through influencing the tourism industry, contributing government organisations and the not-for-profit sectors. The strength and depth of stakeholder collaborations will determine alternative future realities; from a future where all cooperate and share benefits for all parties, to a fatalistic picture where each stakeholder is sailing alone because they consider their interests incompatible, and everything in between. UD should provide a better accessible tourism future that should enhance the competitiveness of tourism destinations and organisations."}, {"title": "Tourism Accessibility for Impaired", "article": "\u201cI have a wife and three children. If I can\u2019t use a product or service, then the business loses not only one person\u2019s business, but five.\u201d\nAs seen in the above quote, Martin Heng emphasizes that people with disabilities and people with different access needs do travel, and are likely to travel with others. And these travelers represent, according to the Amadeus Accessibility Study, a \"$70 billion market\" just in Europe and the USA.\nThis fact alone would make a strong business case for investing time, effort, and resources needed to become more accessible and inclusive as a business and as an industry. But beyond the economic imperative, there are important reasons for the tourism industry to take this segment seriously.\nBelow are some ideas and insights on how and why we should promote not just accessibility, but also inclusive tourism that benefits everyone as well as relevant industry resources for tourism businesses and destinations seeking to better understand accessible and inclusive tourism, and to improve their practices. Parts of the content featured here have been inspired by and based on Martin's presentation (originally recorded on July 18th, 2019 as part of the GSTC Sustainable Tourism Training Online Course).\nTourism for All: Including As Many Different Groups As Possible\nContrary to what many might think, accessible tourism is not just about providing facilities that are wheel-chair accessible.\nSenior travelers. Parents traveling with small kids. Travelers with allergies and other medical conditions. These are all different types of travelers who have different degrees of accessibility restrictions and mobility requirements.\nAnd a large proportion of travelers with disabilities have \"invisible\" impairments (such as cognitive or mental health conditions and long-term illnesses) that may not be, unlike wheelchair users, immediately obvious just by looking at them.\nWhen planning for and communicating about the accessibility features and services you provide, therefore, rather than simply using the \"handicap symbol\" (the ubiquitously used sign of a wheelchair user - the top-left pictogram on the above image), these various areas of accessibility needs must be considered and appropriately indicated.\nShare on your website and brochures, for example, if you provide assistive listening devices on your tour, or if sign language interpretation is available within any of the attractions you visit.\n\"Tourism for All\" is a concept that is addressing a growing segment of travelers with a diverse range of needs and requirements. What is \"accessible\" to one traveler who is a wheelchair user, for example, may be very difficult to access or completely inaccessible to another traveler with a different type of disability, mobility impairment or other conditions.\nThat's why becoming more inclusive is a more appropriate goal for the tourism industry than focusing just on \"accessible tourism\" (which can be vague and hard to define - accessible for whom?).\nAn inclusive tourism business or destination works to offer positive travel experiences to people with different needs by addressing them from various perspectives, and by providing design and service solutions that aim to cover as many different groups as possible.\nUniversal Design: Designing for Everyone, Being a Good Host\nWhen it comes to being inclusive and promoting Tourism for All, a key concept that underlies the solutions to be implement by tourism businesses and destinations is Universal Design.\nThe definition of Universal Design is as follows:\nUniversal Design is the design and composition of an environment so that it can be accessed, understood and used to the greatest extent possible by all people regardless of their age, size, ability or disability. An environment (or any building, product, or service in that environment) should be designed to meet the needs of all people who wish to use it. This is not a special requirement, for the benefit of only a minority of the population. It is a fundamental condition of good design. If an environment is accessible, usable, convenient and a pleasure to use, everyone benefits.\n- Centre for Excellence in Universal Design, \" What is Universal Design\nTo understand where you need to improve in order to offer universally accessible experience for everyone's benefit, take some time to reflect on the whole customer journey from the perspectives of guests with different access needs and mobility requirements.\nThink about how they experience travel - from the customer finding your business, to booking their trip, to arriving in your destination, to getting around during their stay.\nAre there steps to enter the restaurant that will make it difficult for customers with limited mobility? Does your hotel offer an accessible and easy-to-follow process for guests with disabilities to check in/out and get around within the property? And is your website designed for users with different needs (e.g. individuals with hearing or vision impairment)?\nBusinesses often have barriers that make it difficult for customers with particular access or mobility impairments to enjoy a certain product or service, because of the lack of awareness that those barriers exist.\nAnd in some cases, businesses may be \"rejecting\" prospective customers without ever knowing. The 2016 Click-Away Pound study found that \"71% of customers with access needs will click away from a website that they find difficult to use\".\nWith all the different types of accessibility requirements, it may seem difficult or impossible to anticipate and accommodate the various needs of your customers. But it's important to remember that in tourism we are in the business of providing services to welcome guests; and that it is in fact your responsibility as a host to cater to the needs of your guests and to make them feel welcome.\nIt's part of being a good host.\nBy considering the diverse needs and abilities of all throughout the design process, universal design creates products, services and environments that meet peoples' needs. Simply put, universal design is good design. - Centre for Excellence in Universal Design, \"What is Universal Design\"\nInclusive Growth and Sustainable Development\nWith the growing importance of the accessible tourism market, and especially the spending power of this market segment including the \"multiplier effect\" (each traveler with impairment is likely to influence the purchase decisions of multiple members of their party), there is a strong economic imperative to be considered. To remain competitive, your tourism business and destination should be investing in universal design and inclusive solutions.\nBeyond the economic imperative, however, there are also key reasons why inclustive tourism should be part of the global sustainable tourism agenda.\nWith an estimated 15% of the world population living with some forms of disabilities (World Health Organization, World Report on Disability 2011), and the changing demographic of the \"rapidly ageing\" populations around the world (WHO, Aging and Life Course), sustainable development can only be achieved through an inclusive approach to creating solutions and opportunities.\nThe United Nations' \"Disability and Development Report: Realizing the Sustainable Development Goals by, for and with persons with disabilities\" (2018) recognizes that \"striving to achieve disability-inclusive development is not only the right thing to do, it is also the practical thing to do,\" as \"the success of the 2030 Agenda requires a participatory and inclusive approach in which all stakeholders, including persons with disabilities, are engaged.\"\nAnd that's why Tourism for All is highlighted in the Global Sustainable Tourism Criteria, the baseline standard for sustainability in travel and tourism.\nSource: Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC)\nAnd in the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO)'s Global Code of Ethics for Tourism.\nSource: UNWTO, Global Code of Ethics for Tourism\nInclusion in the Work Place\nHaving understood the importance of striving for universal design and working towards becoming more inclusive, what can tourism businesses do to get started? What are some of the first steps?\nOne of the key challenges when considering steps to becoming more inclusive is to understand the diverse needs of your customers and your prospective customers. The barriers that prevent some people from having a positive travel experience - whether they may be steps that cannot be climbed, signs that cannot be read, or buttons that cannot be reached - are hard to notice unless you put yourself in the position of those with particular disabilities and impairments.\nOne of the most effective ways for businesses to understand the various accessibility needs of their customers is to have team members who know and represent the perspectives of those customers. In short, hire people with disabilities. Empower them to help make your business more inclusive, both within your operations and through your products and services.\nThe UNWTO report \"Recommendations on Accessible Tourism\" (2013) states that \"the staff of tourism establishments and related services should be prepared to know, understand and address the needs of customers with disabilities\", and \"the staff should include employees who know how to communicate with persons with sensory disabilities.\"\n\"The hospitality industry serves travellers from all over the world. The diversity of cultures implies a diversity of customer expectations as well. The hotels with a diverse workforce to cater to such a wide customer base hold a strong competitive advantage over others. ... [To] have employees that understand the needs and requirements of the customers and provide key insights into making properties progressively accessible is also a crucial element of the overall business strategy.\" - Hospitality Workers Training Centre, \"Disability Inclusion in the Hospitality Industry Makes Business Sense\"\nBusiness Examples: Staff Diversity and Inclusion\nLemon Tree Hotels Limited, India\nWinner of the 2019 Tourism for Tomorrow Awards, in the category \"Investing in People\", Lemon Tree Hotels have focused on creating a socially inclusive work environment, bringing together people of different backgrounds, abilities and ethnicities to work as a unified team with a common goal. Lemon Tree supports \"opportunity deprived\" workers, including those with physical, social or economic disabilities, by creating and offering opportunities to realize their full potential and live with dignity.\nIlunion Hotels, Spain\nFifty percent of ILUNION Hotels' employees have disabilities. The hotel is committed to integrating its approach to universal accessibility not just in its services for customers with disabilities, but also throughout its business model, including its employees and suppliers. Illunion Hotels received the 2016 UNWTO Ethics Award for its work in the area of accessible tourism for all and its contribution to change attitudes, break down social barriers and make the accommodation industry more inclusive.\nEinsmehr Hotel\nPhoto: hoteleinsmehr\nLocated in Augsburg, Germany, Einsmehr Hotel is an inclusive hotel with about half of its workforce consisting of people with disabilities. The hotel works with a local association \"einsmehr\" (\"one more\"), which supports people with the Down Syndrome in the surrounding area, seeking to create jobs and a labor market for people with (mental) disabilities.\nSV Tenacious\nSource: Martin Heng\nOperated by the UK-based Jubilee Sailing Trust (JST), SV Tenacious is the largest wooden tall ship, and the only one of its kind designed and built to be fully accessible for people with disabilities or impairments (including wheelchair users).\nMartin Heng, who joined Tenacious\u2019 voyage from Sydney to Melbourne in 2018, describes his experience in this Lonely Planet blog:\n\"There are no passengers on JST voyages, only crew \u2013 made up of nine permanent crew members and 30 to 40 voyage crew \u2013 and everyone is expected to fulfil their duties to the best of their ability, whatever that ability is. Experiencing a voyage on Tenacious (or her sister ship Lord Nelson) is an object lesson in the benefits of inclusion and accessibility. People living with a disability can challenge themselves, experience adventure and explore what they are capable of given the opportunity, while able-bodied crew members are shown that disability doesn\u2019t necessarily mean incapacity.\" - Martin Heng, \"Setting sail for accessible adventure on the SV Tenacious\" (Lonely Planet)\nThis amazing example of SV Tenacious is a good reason for all of us in the tourism industry to be asking, as Martin challenges us, \"If they can do this, what excuse do we have not to make mainstream tourism operations more accessible?\"\nSo a better question here, instead of \u201cHow can tourism become more inclusive?\u201d, may be, \u201cwhat are we not (yet) doing to make tourism more inclusive, and how are we going to push for change?\""}, {"title": "Universal Design and Tourism: Why it\u2019s crucial that we focus on accessibility", "article": "In a world where 15% of the population is living with some form of disability and where our population is also steadily ageing it is more important than ever to consider universal design in every industry planning to be operational in our ageing future.\nThe World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) understands this crucial importance and have called for more investment and improved management for disabled tourists globally. The WTTC has outlined two main priorities for destinations wanting to focus on universal design and tourism;\nTo understand the market\u2019s dynamics and opportunities so that operators can prioritise actions accordingly. This includes looking at what leaders in the space are providing and learn from them, as often some simple adaptations or a mere awareness of the needs of people with a disability can make a big difference. Partner with organizations that have experience in working in accessibility to ensure that what operators can provide are appropriate and communicated effectively.\nUniversal design advocates for the consideration of all people with disabilities and not only those who use wheelchairs. Consideration should be given equally to all disabilities such as visual or hearing impairments, learning disabilities, mental health issues, and age-related disabilities. By doing this, the needs of the world\u2019s population will more likely be met.\nSimply put by WTTF president and chief executive officer David Scowsill,\n\u201cTravel and tourism [industry] needs to take accessibility requirements seriously.

The three parties have agreed to extend their partnership agreement for a further four years to ensure that their work to improve accessibility, in every part of the tourism value chain, continues during and beyond the pandemic.\nThe joint work will continue to focus on the promotion of good practices during the current crisis, the application of standards, the measurement of accessible tourism, as well as labour inclusion and institutional disability inclusive policies. The three partners are currently collecting success stories of destinations and companies which have adopted new sanitary protocols to facilitate access to travel and tourism for all, including both residents and visitors. In line with the key UNWTO Recommendations released early on during the pandemic, the Accessibility Champions initiative is still open for submissions illustrating how the guidelines to restart tourism without imposing new obstacles are being successfully implemented. The most outstanding cases will be promoted by the partners through an e-publication and webinars.\nThe three partners are also committed to raising awareness of the forthcoming ISO Standard on Tourism for All. All three have worked with the International Standardization Organization (ISO) on the new requirements and recommendations. The ISO standard will represent a milestone, being the first global standard aimed at implementing and improving accessibility throughout the tourism value chain.\nThe awareness-raising work will sensitize institutions, governments and service providers o the importance of accessibility for all and inclusion.

This includes traveling to this great country as tourists.\nAccording to Statistics Canada, one in five Canadians (22% of the population) live with a disability. This includes a growing segment of the population that is experiencing mobility issues as they age, with 20.6% of Canadians over 65 reporting mobility issues.\nYet in a country that has established laws in place to prevent discrimination against the disabled, surprisingly, there is not a national policy in place dictating what requirements hotels must follow to accommodate those with special needs.\nInstead, accessibility requirements for Canadian hotels are determined by Provincial/Territorial regulations and building codes. Rather than adapting hotel designs across 10 provinces and three territories, many hotel brands take a proactive approach and build all hotels to cater to disabled travellers. This is generally done at the franchise level.\nA wide range of standards\nOntario has been a leader in setting accessibility requirements for the hospitality sector. The province enacted legislation in 2001 and has actively partnered with disability advocates and the Ontario Restaurant Hotel and Motel Association (ORHMA) to set accessibility standards.\nThe Ontario Building Code was amended to require that at least ten percent (10%) of hotel rooms must be barrier-free for guests with physical disabilities. This requirement is capped at 20 rooms, although hotels are free to go above and beyond.\nOther provinces have followed Ontario\u2019s lead to varying degrees. Manitoba introduced a Customer Service Standard to accessibility legislation in 2014. BC, Alberta and Nova Scotia are among provinces that are working with industry and stakeholders to set policies.\nIn 2017 the Federal Government began consultations to explore potential changes to the Canadians with Disabilities Act.\nAmericans With Disabilities Act has set standards for North American chains\nAccessibility requirements for Canadian hotels are largely influenced by guidelines in the USA.\nThe reason?\nCanada\u2019s largest and most recognized hotel brands are American-owned, with the majority of North American properties serving the much larger market south of the border.\nThe Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) requires hotels, motels, inns and other places of lodging designed or constructed after 1993 to meet specified standards for Accessible Design.\nThe American Hotel and Lodging Association and its members have supported ADA initiatives as part of an overall goal to provide a welcoming experience where all guests can enjoy a hotel\u2019s services and amenities.*\nTop brands such as Wyndham and Marriot design their hotels to meet ADA guidelines. Generally, these brands will use their American design standard as the blueprint for Canadian hotel properties.\nFor the hotel, this is not only good for business \u2013 it makes good economic sense. Standardizing builds reduces the costs involved in customizing hotels for individual provincial and state regulations.\nFor example, all Microtel Inns and Suites by Wyndham in Canada mirror US properties and follow a modular design package.\nAll properties include wheelchair ramps, handicapped parking, wider entranceways and swimming pool lifts to help disabled guests get in and out. Each next-generation Microtel sets aside dedicated rooms to provide enhanced accessibility, with roll-in showers, lower countertops and furniture, and more.\nEnsuring your hotel meets Canadian and provincial accessibility requirements\nAs we mentioned, accessibility requirements for Canadian hotels are not guided by national regulations and are instead set provincially.\nNo matter which province you are building in, the representatives of your hotel brand will be able to provide the necessary guidance to ensure your property meets local accessibility requirements. If working with a North American chain, most of the requirements will already be incorporated.\nOrganizations, such as Voice of Albertans with Disabilities, have been strong advocates to broaden accessibility requirements to go above the basics and to account for a wider range of challenges that act as barriers to those with disabilities. Things most of us may not consider.\nAt the end of the day, designing a hotel to meet the needs of those with disabilities shouldn\u2019t be dictated by legislation. It should be guided by the desire to be a socially responsible business that caters to the needs of all customers. It\u2019s all about providing a greater customer experience \u2013 for all guests.\n* Much of this information was garnered from a detailed report from the Voice of Albertans with Disabilities, entitled: Creating Accessible Hotels in Alberta Current Practice, Accessibility Tools, and Recommendations for Action."}, {"title": "Search accessible hotels in Ontario", "article": "This hotel is located less than one mile from the Maid of the Mist Niagara Falls boat tour.

Your carrier is required to allow you to board in advance of other passengers if you have asked for help with boarding, locating your seat or cabin, transferring between a mobility aid and your seat, or storing carry-on luggage. Note: If you ask for this type of assistance, your carrier may require you to board before the other passengers or, if you arrive at the boarding area after the end of priority boarding, to board after the other passengers.\nOn-board\nOn-board wheelchairs and access to washrooms ASL version of this chapter Continue to the next video: Disembarking On-board crew on trains and ferries, and on airplanes which have sufficiently wide aisles, can assist you to go between your seat and the washroom using an on-board wheelchair, including by assisting in your transfer between your seat and the on-board wheelchair. On an airplane, you can use the washroom that has the most space, regardless of where it is located, if you need an on-board wheelchair or the help of a support person or service dog to use the washroom. On-board crew are not required to assist a passenger inside a washroom.\nDisembarking ASL version of Disembarking Continue to the next video: Retrieving your mobility aid If your journey has ended, upon your request, your carrier is required to help you disembark from the aircraft, train, bus or ferry, retrieve your checked baggage, proceed to the general public area, and proceed to a location where you can receive assistance to get to the curbside zone. If you are continuing your journey, upon your request, your carrier is required to assist you in getting to a location where you can receive help from your connecting carrier.\nRetrieving your mobility aid ASL version of Retrieving your mobility aid End of ASL videos - Mobility aids and assistive devices Your mobility aid should be returned to you at your destination in the same condition as when you checked it in, however, damage can occur. If this is the case, having photos of your mobility aid can help establish that the damage happened while your aid was in the carrier\u2019s possession. It is recommended that you take two sets of photos: the first, just before giving your mobility aid to your carrier for transportation; and the second, of the damage to your mobility aid. The two sets of photos can then be compared, which can show the nature and location of the damage. Before leaving the terminal, be sure to complete a damage claim and provide it to your carrier. If your mobility aid is damaged, destroyed, lost or not returned to you within the usual time frame after you reach your destination, depending on the circumstances, your carrier must: provide you with a temporary replacement aid that meets your needs\nreimburse you for expenses you incurred as a result;\narrange for the repair of your mobility or, if this is not possible, provide a suitable replacement or reimburse you for the full replacement cost; or\nif your mobility aid has been destroyed or lost, provide a suitable replacement or reimburse you for the full replacement cost. Note: if you are travelling on an international flight, your airline is required to tell you about the option of completing a special declaration of interest, which is a document designed to protect the value of a traveller's mobility aid. A traveller states the monetary value of their mobility aid and provides a description of its identifying features in the special declaration. A special declaration of interest is important because, without it, carriers' limits of liability for mobility aids carried on international flights are capped at a level far less than the value of most aids. This means that, if a mobility aid is lost, damaged or destroyed and the traveller has not completed a special declaration of interest, they may only be entitled to reimbursement for a portion of the value of the mobility aid. Airlines that operate international flights are required to publish a notice on their websites about the option of completing a special declaration of interest.\nMore resources"}, {"title": "Accessibility, Special needs and Medical Equipment", "article": "We are pleased to welcome on board emotional support and certified service animals that are travelling with a person with a disability.\nService Dog\nAir Transat will, on the request of a person with a disability who needs to travel with a service dog, accept a service dog for transport, and permit the animal to accompany the person on board.
