These recommendations aim to guide the decision-makers of natural resources in tourism in undertaking accessibility improvements. The document has a particular focus on facilitating access to protected areas, beaches and parks. The WCPA Tourism and Protected Areas Specialist Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT), acted as the expert reviewers. Their involvement was key in identifying the best actions geared towards a greater extent of accessibility and inclusiveness within nature areas, vis a vis tourism. The guidance tool, whose drafting was led by UNWTO, the ONCE Foundation and UNE, is part of the promotion of ISO Standard 21902:2021.

The ICOMOS experts\u2019 input was key in covering crucial action areas where accessibility needs to be put in the spotlight, in order to make cultural experiences more inclusive for all people.\nThis guidance tool is also framed within the promotion of the ISO Standard ISO 21902, in whose development UNWTO had one of the leading roles.

The ATD is an annual UNWTO distinction based on an Expert Committee evaluation, which acknowledges destinations enabling a seamless experience to any tourist, regardless of their abilities. The first ATD was awarded in 2019 and has been temporarily put on hold, given the pandemic.\nVideo \"Change your destination\" The video \u201cChange your destination\u201d was issued by Fundaci\u00f3n ONCE and UNWTO by the occasion of the 2019 International Fair of Tourism (FITUR). Facilitating travel for people with disabilities is an exceptional business opportunity. Yet, a change in mind-set and in the model of tourism services provision is needed in order to meet this major market demand. Accessible environments and services contribute to improve the quality of the tourism product and can create more job opportunities for people with disabilities. Accessibility, therefore, must be an intrinsic part of any responsible and sustainable tourism policy and strategy.\nWorld Tourism Day 2016: \"Tourism for All - promoting universal accessibility\" To mark the celebration of the World Tourism Day 2016 under the theme \"Tourism for All - promoting universal accessibility\" UNWTO, the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT) and the Spanish ONCE Foundation for the Social Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities have produced a compilation of Good Practices in the Accessible Tourism Supply Chain. While these examples provide a small sample of possible solutions regarding accessibility, they will hopefully inspire others to take steps towards broadening the availability of accessible offers in tourism destinations around the world.

To find accessible hotels, first search for hotels in your destination, and then check the \u201cIncreased accessibility\u201d box in the \u201cAmenities\u201d filters on the left-hand side of the page. This filter reveals properties that offer these features: wheelchair accessible, facilities for disabled guests, in-room accessibility, accessible rooms, facilities for disabled guests, and disabled access.\nPlaya del Carmen, Mexico\nOne hour from Canc\u00fan International Airport, Playa Del Carmen is a far cry from its more revelrous neighbor, yet still has accessible hotels and an accessible beach furnished with beach wheelchairs. There\u2019s even adaptive equipment to allow you to go snorkeling to enjoy the coral reef and green turtles. But the main reason for coming here is to visit the nearby and largely wheelchair-accessible Mayan archaeological sites, Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 and Tulum, a rare chance for the mobility-impaired to get up close to ancient ruins.\nSan Diego skyline from the harbor \u00a9 David Toussaint / Getty Images\nSan Diego, California, USA\nWith the Americans with Disabilities Act having just celebrated its 30th anniversary, much of the USA\u2019s infrastructure is accessible, but our pick is San Diego. Laid out along the classic grid system, generally flat and with a fully accessible trolley system, it also boasts a balmy year-round 64-80\u00b0F climate.\nThe historic Gaslamp Quarter is very wheelchair friendly, as is the massive Balboa Park (incorporating the slightly hilly San Diego Zoo), but it\u2019s the miles of beachfront promenade with beach wheelchairs available \u2013 including a motorized one with caterpillar tracks at Mission Beach! \u2013 that are the main attraction.\nBarcelona, Spain\nWith the national tourism authority and Catalonia in particular pushing accessible travel, it\u2019s no surprise that wheelchair users have been flocking to Barcelona. With 80% of the metro stations and 100% of buses wheelchair-accessible, as well as a relatively flat and cobblestone-free old city, getting around is a breeze.\nWhat\u2019s more, wheelchair users not only jump to the front of the queue for attractions such as the breathtaking Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, they often get in for free! You can explore the length of La Rambla and get around the famous Mercat de la Boqueria; even the beach has wheelchair access and people on hand to help.\nWelcome to Las Vegas \u00a9 Michael Phillips / Getty Images\nLas Vegas, Nevada, USA\nLas Vegas is undoubtedly one of the most accessible cities for people with disabilities in the US. Of course, the casinos and the venues hosting world-renowned musicians and shows are all wheelchair accessible, as are the vast majority of sites and attractions, many of which \u2013 like the Fountains of Bellagio and the Fremont Street Experience \u2013 are completely free.\nMore surprising, perhaps, the High Roller \u2013 the tallest observation wheel in the world, which takes 30 minutes to do a full revolution \u2013 is also wheelchair-accessible. And if you\u2019re after an adrenaline rush, wheelchair users can even enjoy the SlotZilla Zip Line and the Zoomline, which reach speeds of up to 35 miles an hour, or a hot-air balloon ride over the city.\nAdd to this a very wide choice in accessible accommodation, easy exploration along the wide sidewalks of the Strip, a fully accessible bus service that serves all parts of the city, and plenty of wheelchair-accessible taxis and you can begin to understand why Las Vegas has become something of a destination for wheelchair users.\nManchester, UK\nAlthough it was the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, much of central Manchester was rebuilt in the late 1990s, making smooth, wide, step-free pavements, as well as stepless entry into shops, restaurants and bars the norm \u2013 ideal for anyone with mobility requirements.\nNorthern England\u2019s cultural hub is well served by accessible public transport, leaving you free to pay homage at Old Trafford, learn about our industrial roots at the Museum of Science and Industry or shop with the goths at Affleck\u2019s. And if you\u2019ve had enough of the city, the Peak District National Park, with well-developed facilities for visitors with disabilities, is less than an hour away.\nA piazza in Taormina, Sicily \u00a9 Matt Munro / Lonely Planet\nSicily, Italy\nItaly might not spring to mind as a very accessible destination due to its narrow, often cobblestone streets. But there are a number of tour operators that cater to travelers with disabilities. Motor-impaired travelers can enjoy scuba diving, 4WD off-road driving, traditional Sicilian fishing and olive oil making \u2013 not to mention the gastronomic delights normally associated with Italy. Indeed, two Guinness world records have been set here: first paraplegic to dive to 59m and first blind woman to dive to 41m!\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania, USA\nAs one of the oldest cities in the US, you might not expect Philadelphia to be very accessible \u2013 but it is! While the Old Town may offer some challenges for wheelchair users, sidewalks are generally well maintained in the more touristed areas, with plenty of curb cuts and tactile markings.\nThis is particularly useful for wheelchair users considering most of the city\u2019s attractions are within a two-mile radius of the City Hall. The subway, opened in 1907, is only partially wheelchair-accessible, as is the overland rail network, but unfortunately the aging trolley system is not. However, the city\u2019s fleet of more than 1000 buses are all low-floor and wheelchair-accessible, as is the PHLASH tourist bus which runs a continuous loop downtown, stopping at many popular attractions, and costs only $5 for an all-day pass.\nNeedless to say, all of the city\u2019s most popular attractions \u2013 including Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell, Love Park and the Philadelphia Museum of Art \u2013 are fully wheelchair-accessible despite their antiquity. And when it comes to finding accommodations, there are plenty of wheelchair-friendly options right in the center of the action.\nSandridge Bridge in Melbourne, Australia \u00a9 Catherine Sutherland / Lonely Planet\nMelbourne, Australia\nWith its highly accessible public transport system and compact city center, Melbourne is one of the most accessible cities in the world. Visit the sporting capital of Australia armed with Lonely Planet\u2019s accessibility guide, Accessible Melbourne, a free e-book that includes the most up-to-date advice for travelers with special needs. Discover Melbourne\u2019s best wheelchair-friendly restaurants, enjoy spectacular scenery along the Great Ocean Road, and visit one of the world\u2019s best zoos as well as many of the parks that progressive Parks Victoria is opening up to visitors with access needs.\nLjubljana, Slovenia\nSlovenia\u2019s flat and largely pedestrianized capital, served by accessible electric vehicles, is well worth a visit. Most of its buses are accessible, but the city is so small, with plenty of ramps and curb cuts, you might rarely need them.\nThe city\u2019s main drawcard, the 16th-century Ljubljana Castle is reached via a funicular (free for people with disabilities and a companion) or train, both wheelchair-accessible. Many of Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik\u2019s famous bridges have recently been made accessible, and were joined in 2010 by the award-winning Butchers\u2019 Bridge, which allows wheelchair users access to boats.\nSingapore has established accessibility requirements into its city code \u00a9 Ninnat Fongsupa / 500px\nSingapore\nSingapore has to be the most accessible city in Asia and one of the most accessible cities in the world. Its universal code on barrier-free accessibility, in place for decades, plus increasing affluence have resulted in an infrastructure with stepless access to most buildings and no shortage of curb cuts.\nAlthough power wheelchair-friendly taxis aren\u2019t common, the accessibility of the mass rail transit (MRT) and buses makes them unnecessary. In Singapore, the question is not \u201cwhat is accessible?\u201d but rather \u201cwhat isn\u2019t?\u201d \u2013 from its street food hawker centers to its marvelous zoo.\nVienna, Austria\nLike many European cities, Vienna is steeped in history, being the center of the former Habsburg Empire and the musical heart of Europe. Unlike many of its counterparts, however, its cobblestones have been removed, as have many of the curbs.\nThe refurbished city is both flat and compact, with most central shops and cafes fully accessible. Getting around is relatively easy with elevators to the metro and plenty of low-floor trams. Most museums and places of interest are fully accessible, including the must-see Schloss Sch\u00f6nbrunn.\nYou might also like:\nTake a spin around the globe with an accessible travel expert\nWhat I have learned from travelling the world with a wheelchair"}, {"title": "6 of the World's Most Disability-Friendly Travel Destinations", "article": "This metropolis on the Mediterranean Sea has made great strides in recent years to become fully accessible for people with disabilities.

Back to Map\nSeattle, WA, United States of America\nConsistently at the top of accessible cities lists, Seattle not only offers a variety of top-notch attractions\u2014from music to industry to nature to museums\u2014but most of them are incredibly accessible. The city touts wheelchair accessible taxis, public transportation, and hotels, and provides multisensory indicators on crosswalks. Disabled residents can also use the job accommodation network and BluePath, a nonprofit community that connects consumers and businesses with the common goal to increase accessibility.\nSt. Simon\u2019s Island, GA, United States of America\nThis quaint island in Georgia\u2019s Golden Isles is a great place to relax. Although not all the shops are accessible, many of the attractions and lodging options are, as well as the St. Simon Colonial Island Trolley Tour. However, the most exciting reason to visit is the hard-packed sand on the beach that can support standard wheelchairs (versus beach-specific wheelchairs).\nBecome a Culture Tripper!

Check out The Garrick Inn, an accessible pub that happens to be the oldest in town. The Royal Shakespeare Company is also accessible and has strived to provide access to the arts since 1991. They offer sign language translation, audio descriptions, an induction loop amplification system and infra-red headsets. Other disability-friendly options include lodging, taxis, public transportation, the Stratford Town Walk, the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, banks, churches and pharmacies!\nU.S. National Parks\nNot all national parks are accessible, but the National Park Service (NPS) did create an Accessibility Task Force in 2012 that has since implemented a five-year plan to increase accessibility throughout the parks between 2015 and 2020. NPS also offers a free lifetime pass for U.S. citizens and permanent residents with permanent disabilities, which provides free entrance to 2,000 recreation sites for the pass holder and a limited number of guests (depending on the park), as well as discounts on expanded amenity fees. Among the most accessible are Congaree National Park and Rocky Mountain National Park.\nRocky Mountain National Park | \u00a9 Andrew E. Russell/Flickr\nSydney, Australia\nWith 2,100 tactile and Braille street signs and accessibility for almost all their public transportation, Sydney is quickly becoming a disability-friendly destination. Their Accessibility Map, currently in beta, provides helpful information, such as where to find mobility parking spaces and accessible public restrooms. It also warns of potential barriers, such as stairs or steep inclines. The city is always moving to improve and progress, starting with A City for All: Inclusion (Disability) Action Plan 2017-2021.\nDisney World\nIn response to their goal of increased inclusiveness, Disney World has developed Guides for guests with disabilities and for guests with cognitive disabilities. Service animals are welcome, and the park offers assistive listening, captioning, audio description and wheelchair rental. They also offer a Disability Access Service (DAS), which provides a comparable return time for those unable to wait in a conventional line. Disney Land offers similar accommodations.\nMontr\u00e9al, QC, Canada\nK\u00e9roul is an organization in Qu\u00e9bec that connects those with motor, visual, hearing and other physical impairments with tourist facilities in the province. They have assessed 289 establishments in Montr\u00e9al and list 118 attractions, 58 accommodations, 84 restaurants and 25 other organizations (pharmacies, grocery stores, libraries, etc.) as accessible. Tourist and Leisure Companion Stickers are also available and provide free entrance to attractions for those accompanying disabled persons.\nDublin, Ireland\nDublin has quite the digital spread on information regarding disability-friendly places. Their award-winning website, Mobility MOJO, provides current information on accessibility of hotels, transportation, restaurants, pubs, attractions and more in Dublin and beyond. Although the cobblestone streets, plentiful hills and buildings that are hundreds of years old can present some difficulty, the city is committed to braiding accessibility into its history and character, and its compact design makes it easier to get around, which is further aided with low curbs and added ramps.\nHanauma Bay, Hawaii\nAnother excellent option for disabled persons looking to relax on the beach, Hanauma Bay provides beach wheelchairs free of charge. All their facilities are accessible, as are city buses and the tram to the beach. The movie theater has a separate screen with closed-captioning as well.\nSan Diego, CA, United States of America\nSan Diego is an incredibly diverse city with an array of options for disabled visitors, including free beach wheelchairs and accessible sightseeing tours. Some theaters also provide infra-red audio assistance systems, ASL translation and audio-described performances. Many places also allow service animals. Accessible attractions include the Reuben H. Fleet Science Center, San Diego Zoo and the USS Midway Museum.\nSouth Africa\nAccess 2 Africa Safaris in South Africa is run by safari experts who draw on their personal experiences with disabled individuals. The company was honored with the 2016 South African Lilizela Tourism Award in four separate categories. They also accommodate able-bodied families, individuals and groups, but they specialize in disability-friendly accommodations. Choose from wheelchair-accessible packages in addition to specific tours designed for the hearing impaired (with visually exciting scenes and sign language interpreters) and the visually impaired (with a focus on touch, sound and smells). Choose from one-day, seven-day and 12-day safari experiences for everyone.\nElephants in South Africa | \u00a9 cocoparisienne/Pixabay\nPattaya, Thailand\nPattaya is an excellent choice for disabled individuals seeking a resort experience. All of the rooms at The Royal Cliff Hotels Group have adjusted peepholes, elevators with Braille, portable wooden ramps and swimming pools with safety rails. A-ONE Pattaya Beach Resort was built specifically with wheelchair users in mind. There are no steps in the entire building (including emergency exits), a barrier-free movement design, low-level counters, controls, etc., and menus in Braille. The beaches in Pattaya have limited access, and though it might not be possible to get to the water in a wheelchair, most of the city\u2019s attractions are accessible and are becoming more disability-friendly all the time.\nLEGOLAND\nAs a major resort, LEGOLAND offers many disability-friendly options. Their shops, restaurants, show venues, and most of their rides and attractions are accessible, and there are play areas specifically designed for those with autism and similar disorders. LEGOLAND also offers an Assisted Access Pass with a return time that can accommodate up to six people. Otherwise, the Florida resort offers the Hero Pass, which provides immediate front-of-the-line access for families with a member who is unable to wait.\nLoutraki, Greece\nSirens Resort in Loutraki is a wonderful option for disabled people.

They even offer disabled-friendly excursions around the area.\nSicily, Italy\nIn addition to the increasingly accessible accommodations, Sicily offers disability-friendly features at many of its attractions, including the Castello Ursino Museum, which can accommodate wheelchair users and the visually impaired. Disability-friendly activities on the island include accessible SCUBA, the Tactile Museum and the Sensorial-Botanic Garden. In fact, two Guinness World Records have been set in Sicily: the first paraplegic to dive to 59 meters and the first blind woman to dive to 41 meters!\nVolcanic Iceland Epic Trip meet our Local Insider Hanna HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN A GUIDE? 2 years.

Euromonitor is partnering with accessible travel specialist Sage Inclusion to showcase key findings of a survey of its customers\u2019 needs and preferences, along with challenges faced. With a high travel budget and high multiplier effect, this is an important consumer segment presenting opportunities to diversify the customer base.\nMore work to be done to make travel accessible\nAccording to the Sage Inclusion survey for 2021 (in which the majority of survey respondents resided in North America), despite very high levels of excitement about travel, 96% of respondents agreed that in general, they feel it is harder for someone who has a disability to travel, whilst 74% say that the travel industry does not do enough to make travel accessible.\nFor travel to be truly inclusive, travel products, services and experiences should be accessible by design, and understanding the preferences and needs of accessible travellers is critical, and one size does not fit all.\nStrong engagement demonstrates loyal and potential repeat visitors\nAccording to Euromonitor\u2019s Passport Travel, booking online in North America is deeply ingrained, accounting for 78% of travel sales in 2023. Accessible travellers are even more digitally engaged, with 82% of respondents stating that they were extremely or very likely to book their travel online, based on the Sage Inclusion survey. This is a highly digitally savvy group of consumers, leveraging technology across the customer journey, such as 63% conducting research independently prior to travel, according to Sage.\nAccessible travellers show a preference to book via travel intermediaries, making up 61% of survey respondents, compared with 53% for North America overall, according to Euromonitor research in 2023. A high customer service element and the provision of customised information with tailored services are key factors that ensure their loyalty to this channel.\nThe majority (76%) of accessible travellers in the survey choose to fly, whilst a significant number enjoy taking a cruise (56%), compared with 5% of leisure travel sales being accounted for by cruise in North America in 2023, according to Euromonitor.\nIn IATA\u2019s 2023 Diversity and Inclusion Awards, Virgin Atlantic Airways was awarded for being a pioneer in diversity, inclusion and accessibility, thanks to its refreshed \u201cBe Yourself\u201d strategy, and actions taken to make the workplace accessible for all, along with changes to recruitment, and introducing digital training.\nAppealing to high spenders with a high multiplier effect\nAccessible travellers are high spenders, with. This puts accessible travellers on a par with luxury travellers in terms of per trip spending.\nThe other attribute that makes this traveller segment so appealing is that accessible travellers tend to travel with 2-3 people (accounting for 73% of respondents based on the Sage survey), which drives up the multiplier effect in-destination. 24% of people in the survey do not have a disability, but travel with a family member who does. There is also strong intent to travel, with 45% stating their intention to travel within a year, and 18% in the next six months.\nChallenges and pain points to overcome\nDespite the high level of interest in travel, there are many challenges to overcome, which presents clear opportunities for travel brands. Firstly, diversifying their customer base to this segment is a way to capture a new market. Secondly, hotels and resorts, along with cruise providers, need to address the broader issue of accessibility in general. Two thirds of respondents (67%) in the Sage survey stated that a lack of information is frustrating, which in turn becomes a barrier to undertaking a trip. Without the necessary information, there is too much at risk of taking a leap of faith that products and services during the trip will meet the needs of accessible travellers.\nOther areas of frustration noted are transportation (46%) and airlines and flights (42%), so there is clear room for improvement in the customer experience that accessible travellers face when it comes to transport.\nJohn Sage from Sage Inclusion states that \u201cthere is still much more to be done, and that it\u2019s easy to overlook basic things to make travel accessible. Simple steps can be taken, such as providing more grab bars, ensuring curtains, blinds and towels are within reach, and that hotel rooms are not cluttered. Thinking holistically about accessible travellers\u2019 needs is a great starting point.\u201d\nAbout the survey: the survey was carried out by Sage Inclusion, fielded in May 2021 (no = 257): with 81% of respondents residing in North America.\nTo keep up to date with our Megatrends research click here.\nFor more details about how to embrace the diversity and inclusion megatrend, read our report, Megatrends: Diversity and Inclusion."}, {"title": "Inclusive Travel: The Importance of Getting Tourism Right", "article": "The number of international tourist arrivals surpassed 1.3 billion in 2017, generating an equal $1.3 billion in tourism spending. According to the UNWTO, the gains were led in part by a 9 percent increase in international arrivals in Africa.\nAt a time when so many booming industries are technologies, tourism has become a powerful people-driven economic force, and with that power comes a massive responsibility. In many parts of the world, inequality is widening and wealth increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few. Tourism\u2019s potential for inclusivity presents an opportunity to distribute the economics of a booming global industry more broadly, to communities and people who not only have not benefited from tourism before but may face limited options for building better livelihoods for themselves and their families.\nOur upcoming Africa Travel Summit reminds us of how critically important it is that we get the tourism opportunity right. If done well, the benefits will stay within the communities in which the travel occurs\u2014distinguishing travel from many other industries that have found riches in Africa and exported them elsewhere. For us at Airbnb, the two-day summit will be a chance to hear and learn from some of the continent\u2019s most visionary entrepreneurs in travel and technology. The Summit is part of our $1 million commitment, announced in 2017, to expand tourism in Africa in ways that are local, authentic, sustainable, geographically diverse and yes, demographically inclusive\u2014what we call \u201chealthy tourism.\u201d\nTo help our broader community beyond Africa engage with the Travel Summit, Airbnb will showcase the work of African content creators, highlight African destinations and celebrate African hosts on our global social media channels for the week.\nAlso this month, you can join us in following Jessica Nabongo, who is now nearly 70 percent of the way toward becoming the first black woman to visit all 195 countries and states in the world. A dual citizen of both Uganda and the US, Jessica is using her Ugandan passport as well as her American one in order to raise awareness of outbound African tourism and the mobility gap between US and African passports. We\u2019ll be engaging with Jessica as she travels to Lebanon, Cyprus, Jordan and Beijing.\nBut opportunities to make sure underserved communities can benefit from inclusive travel aren\u2019t exclusive to developing countries\u2014they can be found in the world\u2019s most advanced economies.\nAirbnb\u2019s Srin Madipalli, Suzanne Edwards, and the rest of the team formerly of travel startup Accomable are working with our staff and local governments in the UK and Japan to find ways to expand both hosting and travel opportunities for people with disabilities.\nFor the start of Hispanic Heritage Month on September 15, Airbnb\u2019s own Juntos employee resource group will host a fiesta to celebrate our local employee, vendor, host and guest community and raise awareness of Latinx issues. We\u2019re also sponsoring 25 students as they attend the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute\u2019s Leadership Conference in Washington, DC, a gathering designed to empower young Latinx to take on issues affecting the US Latinx community.\nThis month also brings the second anniversary of Airbnb\u2019s anti-discrimination report, issued on September 8, 2016 as our first step\u2014of what we know will be many\u2014toward eliminating bias wherever possible from our platform. At Airbnb, we are committed to fighting bias through inclusion. Our ability to provide guests with an inclusive travel experience can only start with Airbnb being an inclusive travel company, looking internally and externally for opportunities to champion diversity and rid the platform of potential discrimination. We also believe that inclusiveness is self-perpetuating. As our CEO and Head of Community Brian Chesky often observes, when we travel and experience new surroundings and cultures, we realize people are 99-percent the same.\nAmong the many other initiatives we launched in releasing the report was Instant Book, an opt-in feature for hosts that reduces the potential for bias by allowing any guest to book a listing without securing prior host approval. While we have much more work to do here, I am pleased to report that two years after we launched the feature, Airbnb now offers 3 million listings, 60 percent of our inventory, that are instantly bookable.\nWe also recently took a step toward fulfilling our commitment to diversifying our senior leadership by appointing our first woman board member, Ann Mather, an incredible leader from Pixar and Disney and current board member of both Pixar and Alphabet. Ann joins former American Express Chairman Ken Chenault as our second independent board member. Their expertise and life experience will be vital as Airbnb works toward fulfilling our vision of becoming the world\u2019s first end-to-end\u2014or first truly all-inclusive\u2014travel company."}, {"title": "Comment: Could tour operators do more to deliver truly inclusive travel experiences?", "article": "Julian John, chief executive officer of people development consultancy Delsion, believes too many tourism operators still don\u2019t fully understand and appreciate the needs of disabled travellers\nI love to travel, especially when there\u2019s a plane involved, having done so since an early age and often unaccompanied by my parents to see relatives in Europe as a child. My love affair with air travel has become more strained since 2005, however, when I collapsed with brain damage that left me disabled. I\u2019ve also since adopted two children who are disabled and found that travel for us as a family today can sometimes feel like we\u2019re in the realm of a project that Nasa would be impressed by.\nProfessionally, these experiences have also led me to launch my own people development consultancy, Delsion, and support organisations in all sectors to create more inclusive experiences for the people they provide services to, and who are in their employment too. So, before we look at what could be done better, I first want to say that I have also seen first-hand how a lot of travel professionals do go that extra mile to create inclusive and accessible experiences from start to finish.\nBut having made the transition from someone who travelled extensively with the need of minimal planning and forethought to a disabled traveller with disabled dependants in my care too, for me there is still much to be done if we are to make travel a truly inclusive experience for all \u2013 there are still too many questions tourism operators may have neglected to ask themselves? So, what are they?\nHow many disabled passengers are travelling with you?\nI would be genuinely interested to see how much of an understanding even major travel industry operators have around the numbers of disabled passengers, and the breadth of specific needs they cater for on an annual basis, for example. Based on my experiences as a disabled traveller, a lot of major airlines, theme parks and other mainstream names in the tourism world are still failing to truly consider the position of the disabled traveller or display any kind of joined up thinking when it comes to supporting that person to complete their journey smoothly, from the time they leave their house to the moment they put their key back in the front door.\nThere are still so many issues we encounter on every trip, including being stuck on a plane for over an hour when there were no facilities provided to help us disembark, for instance. Are incidents like this (which continue to be reported in the mainstream media on a regular basis) still happening because travel companies on the whole still view disabled passengers as a very minor segment of their customer base?\nBecause if they don\u2019t have a true understanding of the numbers and needs of disabled passengers that travel with them, and they don\u2019t truly value their custom, then it\u2019s likely these same organisations aren\u2019t prioritising the formation of wider strategies which can help effect inclusive experiences. And without strategies in place, how is everyone (or anyone) within that organisation expected to understand or contribute to what a company might be trying to achieve in terms of supporting customers who sit outside that \u2018unconscious traveller\u2019 bracket?\nDo all of your teams have the knowledge, empathy and engagement to support inclusive travel?\nDo you understand the impact that individuals and teams can have on creating accessible and inclusive environments, rather than just relying on processes? From a previous career I had in retail, I can tell you that everyone in an organisation is and should be responsible for customer service \u2013 and this shouldn\u2019t be any different for disabled travellers. There are still massive issues with the time it takes to access the right person and pass on the information required as a disabled passenger, for example, that you can genuinely lose days in planning a trip.\nIt\u2019s not enough to simply rely on a specialist team or \u2018department\u2019 dedicated to supporting those customers requiring for example, special assistance \u2013 there has to be a widespread understanding culturally that everyone benefits from being able to support inclusive travel and, in turn, better supporting the special assistance teams and disabled individuals they are there to help.\nWhat kind of guidelines do you have in place as an organisation to help your employees understand how you expect them to engage with passengers that sit outside that \u2018standard\u2019 traveller profile? Do you have measures in place that allow you to monitor what you\u2019re doing to reach these passengers, and how well you\u2019re doing it? Do you celebrate those individuals in your organisation that do go that extra mile for the customers they are there to support?\nDo you provide regular and consistent training opportunities for your staff around accessibility, diversity and inclusion that can help them overcome any fears they may have in saying or doing the wrong thing when it comes to supporting disabled passengers? In short, do you train to provide inclusive service?\nDo you realise the potential in doing all of the above?\nTo return to my first point, if travel companies aren\u2019t monitoring the numbers of disabled passengers travelling with them, then they aren\u2019t truly understanding their significance regarding the bottom line either. What we do know is that the \u2018Purple Pound\u2019, which is the estimated spending power per annum of disabled people and their immediate family, is valued at an estimated \u00a3249 billion, and that this is a market sector that cannot be ignored.\nThe caveat here should always be, however, that accessible and inclusive travel experiences should be a right for everyone. So, have you reviewed and re-imagined how you do things to make a wider consideration for inclusion \u2013 and that means inclusion for every traveller, whatever their individual needs may be? From my perspective as a disabled traveller myself, it feels to me that the answer to too many of these questions is still \u2018no\u2019. We need to start focusing on the entire travel experience rather than the destination alone.\nPregnant travellers, parents, older people, disabled travellers to name but a few \u2013 these are the kinds of labels we\u2019re working to at present. But could we be approaching travel provision around more positive behaviours and support \u2013 essentially around everyone who is part of a passenger\u2019s trip \u2013 in order to create truly inclusive experiences for all? What if travel operators looked at every touchpoint and every type of customer interaction to focus on creating a really positive change around the service proposition in general?\nFinally, are you ready to join me answering some of these questions together? I\u2019m more than happy to be proved wrong if so!"}, {"title": "New Inclusive Travel Insights Report: Why Welcoming All Travelers Matters", "article": "Travel\u2014by its very nature\u2014promotes a greater understanding of people from different walks of life. Yet while the travel industry has made some strides toward becoming more inclusive, diverse, and accessible, there\u2019s still work to be done.\nExpedia Group\u2019s mission is to power global travel for everyone, everywhere. To help realize this vision, we started by looking inward to ensure that we are reflecting the diversity of our travelers and modeling the inclusive mindsets that make travel a force for good. We understand the importance of not only practicing inclusion, but also empowering our partners to do the same.\nThat\u2019s why we commissioned custom research to understand how consumers feel about inclusive travel, and how they believe the current travel landscape stacks up. Conducted with Wakefield Research, the study surveyed 11,000 representative consumers in 11 countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, the UK, and the U.S. Our findings are included in a new Inclusive Travel Insights Report to help your brand practice inclusion better, promote diversity, and provide equal access to all travelers. Below is a snapshot of the report.\nAccessibility and diversity in travel\nOne aspect of inclusion is ensuring equal access to all travelers. This is especially important as Baby Boomers are expected to be a growing traveler segment while also experiencing age-related health issues. Our research shows that 54% of this generation finds accessibility in travel is very important, 5% more than the general population.\nAs for diversity, our research shows that 7 in 10 consumers would choose a destination, lodging, or transportation option that is more inclusive to all types of travelers, even if it\u2019s more expensive. This means they are willing to spend more on travel that\u2019s truly inclusive.\nHotel advertising that can reach any traveler, anywhere Travelers looking to book a hotel use multiple channels to find their ideal place to stay, from social media to travel websites, and more. This is why it\u2019s imperative that you know when \u2014 and where \u2014 to reach the right traveler. Whether you\u2019re trying to reach early-bird or last-minute bookers, our targeting capabilities can help you connect with the right traveler at the right time. Connect with your target audience\nLocal culture and community in travel\nIt\u2019s also important for the travel industry to be inclusive of local cultures and communities, and for travelers to pay attention to their interactions with them. Indeed, our research shows that over 1 in 3 consumers are looking for information on ways to engage, recommendations for supporting indigenous cultures, and ways to spend time volunteering while traveling.\nIn fact, 74% would choose a travel option that supports local cultures and communities, even if it was more expensive.\nRepresentation in travel marketing\nClearly travel marketers have an opportunity to do better, to help all travelers and destination communities feel represented. This is important not only because it\u2019s the right thing to do, but also because it\u2019s better for business.\nAccording to our research, 78% of survey respondents said they have made a travel choice based on promotions or ads they felt represented them through messaging or visuals. For Millennials that figure is even higher \u2013 84% have made a travel choice based on representation in travel advertising.\nExamples of inclusive travel marketing campaigns\nSo what does representation in marketing look like? Here are a couple examples of partners that worked with us to help share their commitment to inclusion in their travel advertising.\nVisit Panam\u00e1\u2019s \u201cThe Next Turn\u201d Features Blind Adventurer\nOur research shows that 92% of consumers think it\u2019s important for travel providers to meet the accessibility needs of all travelers. But travel shoppers may not know if a destination they are considering can accommodate them.\nThat\u2019s why Visit Panam\u00e1 partnered with Expedia Group Media Solutions and our award-winning creative team on a new video series called \u201cThe Next Turn\u201d to promote the destination. One episode features Amar, a blind traveler, who experiences a rainforest, volcano hike, and coffee farm in Panam\u00e1 through his sense of hearing, smell, taste, and touch. This campaign showcases how travelers with different abilities can immerse themselves in the amazing experiences Panam\u00e1 offers.\nTourism Malaysia Promotes Local Culture\nAnother way to practice inclusion is to respect local cultures and help improve the livelihoods of host communities.\nTourism Malaysia knows this, which is why it worked with us to create a Travel Spotlight landing page. The Spotlight shows travelers how they can experience Malaysian culture by visiting historical sites such as Georgetown, Penang, a UNESCO World Heritage site and home to one of the largest collections of pre-war buildings in Southeast Asia; or by observing a different way of life in Sarawak, which has traditional longhouses housing communities of up to 100 families; or by visiting the indigenous communities of Kadazan and Dusuns, where visitors can shop an array of traditional handicrafts.\nHow your brand can be more inclusive\nWhen traveler shoppers feel understood and embraced, they\u2019re more likely to book. So how can your brand be more inclusive? First, travel marketers can draw from our Inclusion & Diversity in Travel Advertising guidelines, which documents best practices on delivering marketing campaigns that represent and cater to all people."}, {"title": "New Inclusive Travel Insights Report: Why Welcoming All Travelers Matters", "article": "Travel\u2014by its very nature\u2014promotes a greater understanding of people from different walks of life.

We understand the importance of not only practicing inclusion, but also empowering our partners to do the same.\nThat\u2019s why we commissioned custom research to understand how consumers feel about inclusive travel, and how they believe the current travel landscape stacks up. Conducted with Wakefield Research, the study surveyed 11,000 representative consumers in 11 countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, the UK, and the U.S. Our findings are included in a new Inclusive Travel Insights Report to help your brand practice inclusion better, promote diversity, and provide equal access to all travelers. Below is a snapshot of the report.\nAccessibility and diversity in travel\nOne aspect of inclusion is ensuring equal access to all travelers. This is especially important as Baby Boomers are expected to be a growing traveler segment while also experiencing age-related health issues. Our research shows that 54% of this generation finds accessibility in travel is very important, 5% more than the general population.\nSource: Expedia Group Media Solutions\nAs for diversity, our research shows that 7 in 10 consumers would choose a destination, lodging, or transportation option that is more inclusive to all types of travelers, even if it\u2019s more expensive. This means they are willing to spend more on travel that\u2019s truly inclusive.\nSource: Expedia Group Media Solutions\nLocal culture and community in travel\nIt\u2019s also important for the travel industry to be inclusive of local cultures and communities, and for travelers to pay attention to their interactions with them. Indeed, our research shows that over 1 in 3 consumers are looking for information on ways to engage, recommendations for supporting indigenous cultures, and ways to spend time volunteering while traveling.\nIn fact, 74% would choose a travel option that supports local cultures and communities, even if it was more expensive.\nRepresentation in travel marketing\nClearly travel marketers have an opportunity to do better, to help all travelers and destination communities feel represented. This is important not only because it\u2019s the right thing to do, but also because it\u2019s better for business.\nAccording to our research, 78% of survey respondents said they have made a travel choice based on promotions or ads they felt represented them through messaging or visuals. For Millennials that figure is even higher \u2013 84% have made a travel choice based on representation in travel advertising.\nExamples of inclusive travel marketing campaigns\nSo what does representation in marketing look like? Here are a couple examples of partners that worked with us to help share their commitment to inclusion in their travel advertising.\nVisit Panam\u00e1\u2019s \u201cThe Next Turn\u201d Features Blind Adventurer\nOur research shows that 92% of consumers think it\u2019s important for travel providers to meet the accessibility needs of all travelers. But travel shoppers may not know if a destination they are considering can accommodate them.\nThat\u2019s why Visit Panam\u00e1 partnered with Expedia Group Media Solutions and our award-winning creative team on a new video series called \u201cThe Next Turn\u201d to promote the destination. One episode features Amar, a blind traveler, who experiences a rainforest, volcano hike, and coffee farm in Panam\u00e1 through his sense of hearing, smell, taste, and touch. This campaign showcases how travelers with different abilities can immerse themselves in the amazing experiences Panam\u00e1 offers.\nTourism Malaysia Promotes Local Culture\nAnother way to practice inclusion is to respect local cultures and help improve the livelihoods of host communities.\nTourism Malaysia knows this, which is why it worked with us to create a Travel Spotlight landing page. The Spotlight shows travelers how they can experience Malaysian culture by visiting historical sites such as Georgetown, Penang, a UNESCO World Heritage site and home to one of the largest collections of pre-war buildings in Southeast Asia; or by observing a different way of life in Sarawak, which has traditional longhouses housing communities of up to 100 families; or by visiting the indigenous communities of Kadazan and Dusuns, where visitors can shop an array of traditional handicrafts.\nHow your brand can be more inclusive\nWhen traveler shoppers feel understood and embraced, they\u2019re more likely to book. So how can your brand be more inclusive? First, travel marketers can draw from our Inclusion & Diversity in Travel Advertising guidelines, which documents best practices on delivering marketing campaigns that represent and cater to all people.\nNext, be sure to download the full Inclusive Travel Insights Report for further findings from our custom research, and for additional examples of travel brands that are already fostering inclusion, diversity, and accessibility.\nDOWNLOAD THE REPORT\nAbout Expedia Group Media Solutions\nExpedia Group Media Solutions is a global travel advertising platform that connects marketers with hundreds of millions of travelers across the Expedia Group brands.

It entails removal of attitudinal and institutional barriers in society, and encompasses accessibility in the physical environment, in transportation, information and communications and other facilities and services. It encompasses publicly and privately owned tourist locations.\" (Takayama City and UNESCAP Conference - Press Release - Takayama, 2009)\n- \"Accessible tourism is the ongoing endeavour to ensure tourist destinations, products and services are accessible to all people, regardless of their physical limitations, disabilities or age.

The special issue explores theoretical approaches, foundations and issues in the study of accessible tourism from a futures perspective. Accessible tourism, as with any area of academic study is an evolving field of academic research and industry practice, set within a dynamic social context. The field is interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary, and is influenced by geography, ageing and disability studies, economics, public policy, psychology, law, architecture, construction sciences, technology and marketing. Past research has attempted to view, explain and unpack the inherent complexities (Darcy, 2010) within accessible tourism through a variety of lenses, including human rights, critical tourism, embodiment, customer segmentation and universal design (UD), to name a few (see Buhalis and Darcy, 2011; Buhalis et al., 2012). The special issue is timely given the operationalisation of the United Nations (2006) Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities by 160 countries. Central to the convention is the right for tourists with disability to access transport and built environment in Article 9 and tourism experiences, goods and services within Article 30. It is therefore pertinent to look at the future of accessible tourism and contemplate a number of issues including (but not limited to) the role of technology in reshaping disability; if and how policy makers and planners are addressing the impact of accessible tourism in a sustainable manner; the political influence of people with disabilities, who make up the largest minority group in the USA, on the future of tourism; the science fiction of exoskeletons and gene therapy as a new form of adventure tourist; and the future state of embodied identity and accessible tourism. The special issue provides the opportunity for contributors to take part in the current discourses on accessible tourism from a futures perspective, in order that we can understand, manage and contribute to the development of accessible tourism in the context of economically, socially and environmentally sustainable communities. Specific topics included conceptual and research papers, viewpoints and trend papers, both qualitative and quantitative, discussing topics relating to the future of accessible tourism. Papers include a range of issues including: inclusive destinations; accessible tourism in Development Planning (toward the UN Sustainable Development Goals 2030); policy-making for accessible tourism; embodiment; representation; law and legislation; architecture and universal design; inclusion/exclusion from experiences; markets and needs analysis; accessible transport; accessible events; accessibility and culture/heritage; accessible accommodation; education/training; and technology and applications. In contrast to the past 30 years, where disability and tourism research has been largely concerned with overcoming barriers that exclude certain people (see Smith, 1987), we can discern the contours of new movements in accessible tourism, whereby overarching principles and standards of sustainability, social responsibility and customer service. The delivery of equitable tourism experiences demand the attention of sector actors and stakeholders. Accessible tourism, in this context, should be seen in the future as much more than a range of supports to excluded target groups, becoming a set of ground rules and codes of practice which contribute to the development of all tourism offers and destinations in an inclusive way. If we should gaze into the crystal ball for a moment, we could envisage that tourism will not be defined primarily in terms of different target groups, since principles of responsibility, sustainability and accessibility will in the future inform the quality criteria to which all destinations should comply and be judged as part of destination competitiveness in increasingly global context. Customers will become more aware of their individual rights and also the need to protect and sustain communities and the natural environment, influencing tourism service providers to follow generally accepted rules of service quality, genuine interactivity and engagement with the local culture, people and resources. The capability of tourism providers to recognise those rights for all (e.g. of tourists with disabilities, Design for All, responsible behaviour, inclusion of the local communities in a transparent system of remuneration and participation, working opportunities for socially excluded group etc.) is going to be the threshold, which determines whether their offers will succeed or fail in the future. The tourism sector will increasingly be seen as having transformational power as \u201ca shaper of society\u201d, acting as a promoter of jobs and economic growth, a participant in regional and community planning and a partner in global development programmes. In addition, tourism should be developed as industry that promotes understanding, inclusion and well-being for all in an equitable way. Businesses, destinations and networks, that are already active in the field of accessible tourism and/or representing markets with different specific requirements will participate more widely in the mainstream, bringing their expertise and knowledge to bear on all those issues that are still seen as \u201cdifferent types of tourism\u201d. In the development of accessible destinations and experiences, the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (2015) will be playing an increasingly supportive role, especially through its Global Code for Ethics in Tourism and the recently published Manuals on Accessible Tourism (2015), produced by ONCE Foundation and the European Network for Accessible Tourism (2015b). Before discussing the papers that have been selected for publication we would like to set the scene by examining some major conceptual and policy development areas that we believe will have a significant influence on accessible tourism futures in the future. These include: dreams and aspirations of people with disability; demography; UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; destination competitiveness frameworks; UD; and the newly adopted UN Sustainable Development Goals for 2030. Each of these areas of influence will now be outlined prior to the papers for the special edition being summarised for their contribution to the future of accessible tourism.\nDefining and conceptualising accessible tourism Conceptualising accessible tourism to reflect all its dimensions and multidisciplinarity is critical for the future. The study of tourism and disability has been a reasonably recent phenomenon with the first detailed examination emerging from the leisure constraints literature (Smith, 1987). From this beginning, a great deal of individual studies are emerged that documented significant issues with demand, supply and coordination of travel for people with disability. More recently the field has started to mature with a conceptualisation that has sought to make sense out of the individual studies and provide an overall framework for understanding the phenomena. To assist with this conceptualisation, Buhalis and Darcy (2011) offer the following definition: Accessible tourism is a form of tourism that involves collaborative processes between stakeholders that enables people with access requirements, including mobility, vision, hearing and cognitive dimensions of access, to function independently and with equity and dignity through the delivery of universally designed tourism products, services and environments. This definition adopts a whole of life approach where people through their lifespan benefit from accessible tourism provision. These include people with permanent and temporary disabilities, seniors, obese, families with young children and those working in safer and more socially sustainably designed environments (adapted from Darcy and Dickson, 2009, p. 34 in Buhalis and Darcy, 2011, pp. 10-11). Importantly the definition recognises collaboration between stakeholders across demand, supply and coordination to recognise that disability is a complex construct involving mobility, vision, hearing, cognitive and other embodiments. The definition recognises that developing inclusive destinations and accessible tourism experiences also benefit other groups in the community. Hence, it contributes toward a greater social sustainability of the industry by including and, hence, providing for a much broader cross-section of consumers that has previously been considered by the industry. In understanding the importance of individuals with disability, the stakeholders they engage with and the influence of UD on the products, services and environments they wish to seek enabling experiences. Buhalis and Darcy (2011) suggests that to develop accessible tourism futures destination managers must strategically plan through the lens of UD. Figure 1 outlines the cyclical strategic approach to engaging UD approaches across disability and lifespan considerations as a foundation for developing future accessible destination experiences.\nDreams and aspirations of people with disability The dreams and aspirations of individuals play a fundamental role in shaping the choices, which lead them to travel. Among people who live with a disability, the idea of leaving behind one\u2019s everyday surroundings and going on a journey can create significant anxiety (Darcy, 1998). People with disability often can design or influence their everyday environment whilst they have routines to negotiate any difficulties and thresholds that exist. This does not apply to new environments whilst travelling, where they do not have prior knowledge, networks or influence on the design nor the potential barriers that are to face and the way to overcome them. Indeed, a recent European survey (GfK, 2015) suggests that up to half of people with disability do not travel on holiday, due to a combination of lack of reliable information, lack of funds and previous bad experiences. Yet, the desire to travel remains with studies showing that it is not a person\u2019s impairment that impedes their travel but a series of interpersonal, attitudinal structural constraints (Daniels et al., 2005; Darcy, 2003). In recognising that a person's impairment does not constrain their travel motivations, the boundaries to what is regarded as accessible tourism destinations and experiences are continually pushed by the accessible explorers who forge new pathways for others to follow.\nMillennium development goals (MDGs) and the UN global compact At the Millennium Summit in September 2000 the largest gathering of world leaders in history adopted the UN Millennium Declaration, committing their nations to a global partnership to reduce extreme poverty and setting a series of targets, with a deadline of 2015. These targets, known as the MDGs are a set of eight specific goals set by the 191 United Nations member countries that have the goal of halving world poverty by the year 2015: Eradicating extreme poverty continues to be one of the main challenges of our time, and is a major concern of the international community. Ending this scourge will require the combined efforts of all, governments, civil society organizations and the private sector, in the context of a stronger and more effective global partnership for development. The Millennium Development Goals set timebound targets, by which progress in reducing income poverty, hunger, disease, lack of adequate shelter and exclusion \u2013 while promoting gender equality, health, education and environmental sustainability \u2013 can be measured. They also embody basic human rights \u2013 the rights of each person on the planet to health, education, shelter and security. The Goals are ambitious but feasible and, together with the comprehensive United Nations development agenda, set the course for the world\u2019s efforts to alleviate extreme poverty by 2015 (United Nations Secretary-General BAN Ki-moon). The aim of the MDGs is to encourage development by improving social and economic conditions in the world\u2019s poorest countries. Since the MDG\u2019s were agreed to significant progress has been made. To date average overall incomes have increased by approximately 21 per cent. The number of people living in extreme poverty declined by an estimated 130 million. Chile mortality rates fell from 103 deaths per 1,000 live births a year to 88. Life expectancy rose from 63 years to 65 years. An additional 8 per cent of the developing world\u2019s people received access to clean water and an additional 15 per cent acquired access to improved sanitation services. In 2015 the UN countries will adopt a new sustainable development agenda and a new global agreement on climate change. The actions taken in 2015 are expected to result in new sustainable development goals that build on the eight MDG\u2019s (United Nations, 2015). Tourism has long been seen as having significant potential to help achieve the MDG\u2019s in developing countries. For example in 1990 developing countries had 18 per cent of international tourism receipts. By 2005 this had risen to 30 per cent and to date it continues to rise. There has been significant promotion of the direct economic links between tourists and the poor. Tourism may provide employment opportunities for marginalised groups, may bring direct income to individual communities and may promote equality in developing countries (Saarinen and Rogerson, 2013).\nUD supports destination competitiveness The tourism industry needs to design and deliver offerings and services that are suitable to all potential users and remove any physical or organisational barriers that can prevent visitation. UD incorporates the accessibility requirements of people with the widest possible range of abilities, so that the greatest number of people can use mainstream products and services without the need for adaptations or special interfaces. Additionally, mainstream products and services should use interface standards which match those of technical aids, so allowing disabled people to access and use mainstream equipment. UD has been defined as: Universal design is the design of products and environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design. The intent of the universal design concept is to simplify life for everyone by making products, communications, and the built environment more usable by more people at little or no extra cost. The universal design concept targets all people of all ages, sizes and abilities\u2019. The Universal Design approach goes beyond traditional design, which tends to focus on the \u2018average\u2019 user. Universal Design is a design approach, reflecting a way of understanding people\u2019s needs. It is not a list of particular solutions, measurements, or products \u2013 Universal Design is the way to reach the solution, contributing to social inclusion (cited in Center for Universal Design, 2009; and first articulated by Mace, 1985). Applying the principles of UD can be seen as a way of developing tourism environments, transportation, services and offers, underpinning sustainable communities and businesses. Today, according to a recent study by European Network for Accessible Tourism (2015a) and partners, less than 10 per cent of tourism suppliers in Europe offer \u201caccessible\u201d tourism services, while demand for such services is set to increase due to the ageing population and continuing upward trend in market demand. Adopting UD enlarges the target markets of destinations as well as ensures that more pleasant experiences can be delivered. Therefore it can increase the market base, reduce seasonality and support the competitiveness of destinations (Buhalis, 2000). Yet, few studies have examined accessible tourism in relation to destination management and only recently has accessible tourism been examined from destination competitiveness perspective (Dom\u00ednguez Vila et al., 2015).\nPapers in this issue To address these concepts and developments this special issue is bringing a range of papers together that discuss research on many accessibility tourism aspects. Naniopoulos and Tsalis (2015) discuss a methodology for addressing the accessibility of monuments. They focus on heritage attraction sites, highlighting the challenges with archaeological sites where interventions become problematic or even impossible. In doing so, they approached accessibility as a dual notion; accessibility of an area and its potential for independent physical access and movement around the monuments as well as perceived accessibility in terms of interpreting, understanding and learning from the environment. The methodology was applied to a number of byzantine monuments as part of a cultural route in the city of Thessaloniki in Greece, as case studies. Results provide both tools for assessing monument accessibility (process orientations and checklists) and insights into the needs of travellers with disabilities for more \u201cusable\u201d heritage attractions. Concluding remarks place a focus on the prerequisites of training and cooperation to allow for the future of accessible monuments to be realised. Tsalis et al. (2015) provide an interesting study on the challenges of implementing accessibility solutions, also within the context of protection, conservation, and management of historical centres and monuments. Viewed from a tourism perspective, archaeological sites and monuments are location bound and exist only in their original place. Hence, access to such sites enables unique and authentic tourism experiences. Discourses on objective, constructive and existential authenticity are of paramount importance when accessibility is concerned. This study provides relevant examples of accessibility interventions on six monuments as well as considerations on the design of the tools that assisted site interpretation and interconnection in a cultural route. Results demonstrate how accessibility improvements can occur while respecting the history, architecture and character of the monuments. The study concludes by emphasizing that it is primarily through providing greater access, that the \u201csocialisation\u201d of these monuments will propagate authentic tourism experiences in the future. Bowtell (2015) offers an examination of the market value and attractiveness of accessible tourism in Europe. Historic data were used to provide a forecast for 2025, while primary data obtained from travel and leisure companies provided insights into managerial perceptions. Findings show a very promising potential for accessible tourism market with significant projected revenues. However, a number of challenges including lack of awareness, cost of investments, complexity of customers\u2019 needs and legal inconsistencies within the EU, create barriers toward developing comprehensive solutions for accessible tourism. Authors provide recommendations on bridging demand and supply. Gillovic and McIntosh (2015) present an interesting study on stakeholder perspectives of the future of accessible tourism in New Zealand. The study provides insights into the current situation and the future propensity for an accessible tourism industry in New Zealand. A number of interviews with key stakeholders revealed that there is a need to develop a culture of accessibility that is perceived as the norm. Findings also include the business and demand arguments, but additionally highlighted the \u201cineptness\u201d of upper industry levels to recognize the opportunity of accessible tourism, exhibiting apathy and complacency instead. Authors conclude with recommendations for the future of accessible tourism in New Zealand which can easily be generalised for other regions. Zajadacz (2015) discusses the evolution of models of disability as a basis for the future development of accessible tourism. A review of medical, social, biopsychosocial, geographical and economic models of disability reveals the theoretical underpinnings and assumptions entailed in those. These are then linked to tourism, demonstrating that different models influence the tourism provision in terms of both products and services. Authors highlight the understanding of disability under different models toward diverse tourism experiences. Several suggestions are offered on the complementary of the models and the implications on the transformation of the accessible tourism industry in the future. Cruces Portales (2015) uses a scenario planning approach to envisage alternative futures for accessible tourism. With a timeframe leading to 2050, four alternative futures are unravelled through storytelling. The scenarios are built on a matrix that includes the opposing forces of empathy \u2013 apathy, and fear of loss and certainty of benefits. The resulting, aptly named scenarios (Eden Gardens, Golden Bridge, Wasted Future and State of Hope) showcase different behaviours, schedules of changes and insights. Authors conclude with strategic ideas and proposals for the future of accessible tourism.\nConclusion When exploring the future of tourism in this area two opposing trends can be observed: future societies are predicted to become more similar, more homogenous as a consequence of consumerism, globalisation and converging urban lifestyles. However, the accessible tourism market is characteristically diverse, with complex needs and the range of dreams and ambitions is boundless. Will future global travellers be able to access more varied and personal services or will increasing numbers of travellers give rise to greater standardization of services? Accessible tourism as an emerging field of study will influence tourism destination competitiveness in the future, whether that be from a human rights, emerging market segment or service delivery perspective. In this conceptual examination, we have presented implications of number of theoretical constructs and lenses through which accessible tourism will be influenced in the future. In this special issue, a number of future dimensions are explored that demonstrate how the field has moved from an examination of the intersection of disability and tourism, to one that is clearly defined through conceptual and definitional approaches as accessible tourism. There is a common thread amongst all the papers presented in this special issue. They focus around stakeholder collaboration, as a foundation for the future development of accessible tourism. It has been explicitly suggested that raising awareness amongst stakeholders is essential to overcome barriers inhibiting the application of solutions that enhance access. The importance of stakeholder collaboration across the accessible tourism value chain has been emphasized in a number of ways in this special issue. Improving accessibility of facilities, transportation, attractions and destinations more generally, demands the collaboration of a wide range of stakeholders including architects, designers, economists, local councils, policy makers, travellers with disabilities, historians and archaeologists to name a few. Therefore \u201csocialising\u201d tourism means that access can be granted only when a number of relevant stakeholders are in accord, work together and specifically developed strategies to target the accessible tourism market. Stakeholder collaboration is a key factor for developing accessible tourism solutions, recognising the value of the market and capitalising on it. Hence, a collaborative approach is required to recognise the complementary nature of the different paradigms; to re-shape and transform the future of the accessible tourism through influencing the tourism industry, contributing government organisations and the not-for-profit sectors. The strength and depth of stakeholder collaborations will determine alternative future realities; from a future where all cooperate and share benefits for all parties, to a fatalistic picture where each stakeholder is sailing alone because they consider their interests incompatible, and everything in between. UD should provide a better accessible tourism future that should enhance the competitiveness of tourism destinations and organisations."}, {"title": null, "article": null}, {"title": "Ethical: Barrier Free Tourism", "article": "Tourism Accessible for All in Europe\nJoe McClain\nFor those who associate tourism only with holiday and leisure and luxury it should be mentioned that tourism is a sector of remarkable economic importance.

From Braille-friendly information centres to barrier-free infrastructures, accessible tourism adds value to travel experiences, enabling people from all walks of life to travel with equity. That vision can be a reality with the help of ISO 21902, which facilitates enjoyment of travel by people of all ages and abilities \u2013 making tourism accessible to everyone.\nA study suggests that accessible tourism is a significant emerging market, expected to generate revenues of EUR 88.6 billion by 2025. The standard helps tourism service providers promote tourist-friendly destinations for the disabled and realize the opportunities this lucrative market has to offer. Whether you are an expectant mom, a senior citizen or a person with a disability, you have the same right as everybody else to enjoy life through barrier-free tourism.

At the heart of the standard is preserving tradition, from specifying what restaurants should look like to how food is to be served to demonstrate that they stay true to their heritage. This will help tourists make more informed choices on where to dine and savour the locals\u2019 culinary pride.\nTravelling green\nSustainability will continue to be a priority for hotels in 2022 and beyond, with recent studies suggesting that 76 % of travellers would choose accommodation facilities that have sustainable practices in place. With the help of ISO 21401, accommodation facilities can improve their environmental impact, promote social exchange and contribute to local communities.\nAccommodation is pivotal for tourist activities and holds immense potential for sustainable tourism. The global interest in sustainability increases people\u2019s desire to experience more sustainable services and products.

From minor annoyances to violent crimes, getting from point A to B can be fraught with risk.\nGoal 11 of the United Nations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sustainable development goals exhorts member states to provide safe, affordable, and accessible transportation for everyone, especially those who find themselves in vulnerable situations. And yet, while disparate initiatives have been launched around the world to make public commutes safer and accessible for everyone, a survey of the United Nations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and other international agencies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 research, plus our own analysis, suggests there is still more to be done across the three main stages of the commuter journey: planning and booking, the predeparture experience at boarding areas, and the travel itself.\nIn this article, we consider just how inclusive global public-transit systems are and explore ways that municipalities, urban planners, and other key stakeholders can assess and accommodate the end-to-end needs of all travelers.\nHow inclusive are our public-transit systems?\nOver the past decade, international organizations such as the United Nations have made the concerted effort to study inclusivity in urban-transport systems as a means to guarantee fair opportunities for all commuters. The insights that have come out of this endeavor fall under two broad themes.\nFirst, a collection of studies\u00e2\u0080\u0094including the UN Commission on the Status of Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Safe cities and safe public spaces for women and girls study\u00e2\u0080\u0094provide analyses of the key safety and communications issues that public-transport operators need to address. These include reducing violence and harassment on public transit, ensuring safer nighttime commutes, and providing clear, effective, around-the-clock communication between operators and travelers.\nSecond, a separate stream of research studies the main barriers that limit inclusion on public transit for women, people with disabilities, and low-income travelers, among others. Critical obstacles include, among others, poorly designed transportation, high ticket prices, inadequate safety regulations, and schedules that fail to account for the travel patterns of commuters with specific needs.\nAs they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve become aware of these issues and limitations, many public-transit system providers and urban planners have launched initiatives to address them\u00e2\u0080\u0094to limited effect, however. Such campaigns and programs have typically been introduced in an ad hoc manner rather than integrated into the overall public-transport system.\nSome cities, such as Los Angeles and Santiago, focused on surveying travel patterns of public-transit users, while others, including a major European capital and a large city in Southeast Asia, mostly worked on communication campaigns to raise awareness of nighttime safety. Other cities\u00e2\u0080\u0099 efforts were limited in scope. In Madrid, for example, on-demand bus stops were introduced on suburban routes during specific times to reduce the walking distance home for female passengers.\nFrom booking to travel: An end-to-end approach to inclusion\nShare From the inside out: Inclusion in the urban-transport workforce According to the latest Kantar Inclusion Index, less than half of transportation employees believe that their organizations are actively pursuing inclusion. In addition, the sector reports above-average workplace bullying/harassment and situations in which employees were made to feel uncomfortable. Fostering greater inclusion for public-transport employees requires providers to start with an accurate assessment of where they stand. Then, they can begin embarking on diversity, equity, and inclusion\u00c2 (DEI) transformation journeys to reshape their way of working. Diversity refers to workforce composition across various identity-related characteristics, such as gender, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, and disabilities. Equity focuses on ensuring that identity is not predictive of opportunities or workplace outcomes. Inclusion refers to the degree to which an individual feels that they can bring their authentic selves to work, enabling them to contribute in a meaningful and deliberate manner. From our experience working in this space, public-transport providers can gain DEI awareness in different ways. Sometimes targeted, eye-opening workshops aimed at uncovering deeply rooted unconscious bias represent a wake-up call for organizations: having diverse subsets of colleagues collaborate to identify unexpected biases in their ways of thinking is sometimes sufficient to trigger top-management engagement toward a new way of working. In other cases, transport agencies go even further and fully train their staff on civil-rights issues, among others, and on potential biases toward underrepresented categories. In other cases, achieving a profound understanding of the internal level of inclusivity can require more time and various sessions at all levels of the organization. Once companies agree that room for improvement exists, the journey to a fully inclusive work environment unfolds. After the first step of assessing and building the fact base through company-specific business cases, other challenging steps of the process remain: Architect (development of key performance indicators and road map): beginning with a solid awareness and understanding of the internal level of inclusion, companies develop a plan by designing a portfolio of initiatives linked to specific and tangible objectives, prioritizing them on feasibility and expected impact. The initiatives plan is complemented by the identification of pilots to be launched and tested, either on selected perimeters or on a company-wide basis.\nAct (test and learn with quick programs): companies start launching pilots and initiatives on target business units, functions, and geographies, in line with the agreed-upon implementation plan. As the plan unfolds, insights from pilots can be used to learn and refine ongoing and future initiatives.\nAdvance (build on success and track progress): in the core phase of the implementation, companies get the program to full scale. This requires a strong monitoring and accountability structure, alongside a proven knowledge codification and sharing system to constantly improve idea generation and the implementation of initiatives. Among public-transportation providers, one of the most notable programs in the past few years was launched by the roads and transport authority in a major city in the Middle East, which focused on including and elevating women\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, it created a dedicated fund for high-performing women employees and another initiative for \u00e2\u0080\u009cpeople of determination,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which included ad hoc employment and training programs.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time for urban-transport providers to draw from our collective understanding of inclusion and design and implement an urban-transport system that works for everyone. While this article focuses on the customer journey, travel providers should not miss the opportunity to transform their own organizations as well (see sidebar, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom the inside out: Inclusion in the urban-transport workforce\u00e2\u0080\u009d).\nTo further contribute to our existing understanding of travel and inclusion, we conducted our own research. We surveyed more than 20 different public-transport operators around the world and identified key requirements and initiatives for an inclusive public-transport system. We found that while there are many initiatives to enhance inclusion, they are typically not part of an integrated, 360-degree framework. We believe that a comprehensive and integrated approach to inclusive transportation comprises initiatives that fall into six categories (Exhibit 1).\n1\nWe mapped these requirements and initiatives along the commuter journey, which we broke down into three parts: the booking stage, the predeparture stage, and the actual travel experience (Exhibit 2). In each phase, there are actions travel providers can take to address specific pain points. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll explore those actions using the example of a rail-based journey\u00e2\u0080\u0094although the conceptual principles here can be applied to other forms of urban transport, such as buses and ferries.\n2\nThe booking stage\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s common nowadays for people to use navigation apps to find the most convenient route to their destination. The would-be passenger decides on the starting and arrival points, preferred mode of transport, and time of travel. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll factor in potential route disruptions (and explore alternatives, if necessary), how crowded the commute might be, and whether there are any loyalty-program benefits to be accrued.\nThis stage presents a number of potential pain points for some commuters. For instance, a wheelchair user may not know if a train station is equipped with elevators and if there are design barriers that may make it difficult to board and alight from a train.\nSome cities have tried to create a more accessible and safe experience for senior travelers. For instance, Salzburg has launched initiatives to promote the use of public transport among older people. The city has hosted \u00e2\u0080\u009cmobility days,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and pamphlets on commuter safety can be found in all train stations. Salzburg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bus drivers are also trained to be extra vigilant around older passengers, and vehicles are designed with senior citizens in mind. These initiatives have reduced accidents among older people and increased awareness among the remaining population.\nOur research points to a number of actions urban-transport providers can take at the booking and planning stage to create more inclusion. For instance, they could create pooling options in their travel apps so that passengers could choose to commute in groups. They may offer special rates at this stage as well, to disabuse people of the idea that accessible travel options are more expensive than standard ones. Passengers could also be given the option to easily share their itinerary with their friends and loved ones for an additional layer of oversight.\nTravel providers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 mobile apps may also provide a direct line of communication between the traveler and the provider and are a tool providers may want to use more strategically. Safety issues could be flagged immediately. Information about security measures, optimal travel times, and easy-access facilities could be relayed through this channel when passengers check and confirm their itinerary. The Transport for London, for instance, allows for just this with its dedicated journey planner; the app lets would-be passengers optimize their journey from the booking stage.\nPredeparture phase\nArriving at a station or terminal can be an overwhelming experience, with hordes of people crisscrossing in every possible direction\u00e2\u0080\u0094businesspeople rushing to catch their trains with barely minutes to spare, families trying to herd rowdy children toward the right platform, and buskers plying their craft.\nFor many, the predeparture phase looks like this: you receive a push notification from your travel provider with information about your train\u00e2\u0080\u0099s departure time. To get to the platform you go through a thermal-imaging scanner that checks your temperature, you make it past the turnstile with an electronic ticket, and you find the correct platform, where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll wait to board.\nFor groups or travelers with specific logistical needs, this phase can be full of hazards. If they are early for their train, for instance, such passengers may find few accessible waiting spaces to accommodate them.\nThere are a number of ways urban-travel providers can improve the predeparture experience for all travelers. They may want to integrate important safety and pooling information into the departure reminder, noting the location of accessible facilities and safe train cars\u00e2\u0080\u0094carriages with an attendant, conductor, or security officer. Visual \u00e2\u0080\u009cnudges\u00e2\u0080\u009d and cues could promote positive behaviors, such as offering assistance to people with mobility constraints or to pregnant women. In stations where longer wait times are common, more rooms for nursing mothers and a greater number of dedicated waiting areas could be created. Treating the station as a civic space by promoting community-focused activities\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as increasing retail outlets and installing open pianos\u00e2\u0080\u0094could also enhance commuters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sense of safety.\nIn 2006, the city of Graz, Austria, upgraded its key stops to make them both more accessible and livable; and, targeting both safety and comfort in its train platforms and stations, the Canadian cities of Ottawa and Toronto created designated Transecure waiting areas.\nTraveling and arriving at the destination\nThere are a number of actions travel providers can take to make passengers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 journeys inclusive once they are on board. For instance, it is possible for travelers on most trains to track their progress while en route\u00e2\u0080\u0094but it may not always be clear how to request help in cases of violence of harassment. Particularly when it comes to late-night routes, passengers may be in near-empty train cars. To provide peace of mind for all passengers, urban-travel planners should install highly visible GPS panic buttons throughout the system, as they have in New Delhi and Bangalore.\nCommuters with specific needs could be directed to the train\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safe wagons with security personnel and closer supervision. Pregnant women or passengers with specific physical needs could wear \u00e2\u0080\u009cMay I sit\u00e2\u0080\u009d pins to alert other commuters to give way to them. Travel providers could also make it easier for these commuters to find information about connections and the safest ways to get to the next boarding point.\nWhile our case study focuses on rail travel, alternative transport modes may offer other opportunities for greater inclusion. The flexibility afforded by bus travel presents more options for making the travel experience safer. Passengers could be allowed to alight, on request, at specific time slots, for example, from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m., to reduce the distance between the drop-off point to the final destination. This is exactly what the city of Madrid put in place, arranging on-demand night bus stops on interurban bus lines.\nCreating an inclusive urban-transport system doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop the moment a passenger gets off the train. Transport providers could review the arrival experiences and partner with security companies to provide additional support or with taxi and rideshare companies to provide special rates for arriving passengers.\nSetting the goal of an entirely accessible public-transport system is becoming increasingly common in major cities worldwide. Barcelona has committed to a 100 percent accessible underground metro system by 2024, and Seattle is already fully wheelchair accessible.\nOther municipalities and travel providers can do the same by undertaking a thorough assessment of customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 needs along the whole journey, mapping the potential pain points, and implementing targeted initiatives to address them. Of course, this process is an iterative one; any initiatives launched should be evaluated and refined over time. The systemic, end-to-end approach outlined in this article should help make traveling in our cities truly safer for all."}, {"title": null, "article": null}, {"title": "Next stop: a transport system accessible for all", "article": "Once known for its matchstick industry, the small Swedish city of J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping has another claim to fame. It is one of the most accessible cities in Europe for people with disabilities.\nThe winner of the 2021 Access City Award, J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping was recognised for its inclusive and universal bottom-up approach. Working closely with disability organisations, city officials rolled out a wide range of initiatives to make buildings, products and environments accessible to as many people as possible.\nCity-wide improvements include tactile maps and signage, audio descriptions, tactile paving, easy to read facilities, accessible pavements and barrier-free wheelchair access. From the concert hall to the matchstick museum (one of only three in the world), J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping\u2019s attractions, shops, public buildings and infrastructure meet the long list of accessibility criteria.\nIndeed, J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping is one of many examples of European cities that are friendly to people with disabilities. And with one in five Europeans living with some form of disability, city actions are proving indispensable in order to cater to a growing need for accessibility.\nMaking it easier to move around\nTo rise to the challenge of universal accessibility, cities can benefit from innovative technologies that promote a barrier-free and inclusive society. Solutions may involve the use of augmented reality, wearables and artificial intelligence. These are just some of the smart tech solutions that scientists are co-designing together with disabled persons in line with the EU\u2019s Urban Mobility Framework.\nTransportation researchers in the Netherlands recently made an important discovery by surveying disabled commuters. They learned that the single most popular item in demand amongst users with different types of disability would be a simple, smart information tool. Imagine a special version of Alexa for travel - an interactive accessible journey planner that would greatly improve people\u2019s mobility and willingness to travel.\nThe researchers, who are working closely with a Europe-wide network of disabled citizens and are supported by the TRIPS project, are drawing on this finding to develop and test mobility solution models.\nAccording to Kristina Andersen, Assistant Professor at the Future Everyday cluster of the Department of Industrial Design at Eindhoven University of Technology, a smart planner is needed to provide accurate information on the accessibility of transport. It could include, for example, the availability of seats on the next bus or whether certain accessibility infrastructure is \u201cout of order\u201d. The smart planner would provide this information in multiple ways - sign language, audio, lip-reading \u2013 as well as be integrated with smart glasses. It would also be free to use and not require registration.\n\u2018Poor access to public transport means people are stopped from accessing job opportunities, education, social and leisure activities and other services,\u2019 explained Andersen.\n\u201c By focusing on the experience and needs of disabled people, we address a wide variety of barriers such as age, health, or language in current urban transport systems. Professor Kristina Andersen at Eindhoven University of Technology and TRIPS lead.\nTo showcase how such co-designed mobility solutions can provide inclusive urban transport for all, TRIPS is rolling out case studies in seven pilot cities: Brussels, Bologna, Cagliari, Lisbon, Sofia, Stockholm and Zagreb.\nBy inviting those with disabilities to highlight the problems they face in using public transport and empowering them to co-design solutions through brainstorming with experts, Andersen and her team hope to address the most serious risk facing people with disabilities: that of social exclusion.\n\u2018By focusing on the experience and needs of disabled people, we can address a wide variety of barriers such as age, health or language in current urban transport systems,\u2019 said Andersen.\nAll of this information is not just helping with new innovative services, but also sheds light on what\u2019s needed when designing future transport systems.\nLeveraging digital technologies\nThe user perspective is important when designing and testing mobility solutions for persons with disabilities.\nIn this context, researchers from the MOBI Mobility, Logistics and Automotive Technology Research Centre at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) are conducting a pilot study in Antwerp. They are testing a new method to assist visually impaired people at pedestrian crossings by sending audio and vibrating messages to their smartphones, so they can safely cross the road.\n\u2018In most cities, only a select few traffic lights have pedestrian signs with audible signals,\u2019 said Assistant Professor Imre Keseru, who is the lead researcher on the INDIMO project. \u2018Often, these get installed on demand and cause complaints from local residents due to the noise produced. They are not always reliable and can malfunction. Therefore, more often than not, blind people have to trust in their own hearing to make sure the pedestrian light is definitely switched to green.\u2019\nKeseru also noted that until recently, digital mobility solutions were mainly developed to address the needs of average users, leading to the exclusion of specific groups with very specific needs.\nAdditionally, \u2018while significant achievements have been made mainly in terms of improving the physical accessibility of transport, digital accessibility and inclusion have not been fully addressed,\u2019 said Keseru.\nINDIMO researchers are tackling this issue, working with policymakers, tech developers, transportation operators and persons with disabilities. They have created a toolbox featuring universal design principles that include accessibility standards for transport services, plus cybersecurity and privacy guidelines to encourage more accessible and inclusive digital mobility solutions for all.\n\u201c While significant achievements have been made, mainly in terms of improving the physical accessibility of transport, digital accessibility and inclusion have not been fully addressed. Imre Keseru, Urban Mobility Assistant Professor at Vrije Universiteit Brussel and INDIMO lead, https://mobi.research.vub.be/ INDIMO\nWhile the first version of this toolbox is being tested in Antwerp with the intelligent traffic light system, four additional pilot projects (in Spain, Italy, Germany and Israel) are exploring innovative solutions such as on-demand ride sharing in tandem with multimodal route planning.\nWhat all research projects have in common is a call for better digital services to aid disabled users\u2019 mobility and overall quality of life. They also highlight the need for better digital education and tools to enhance social inclusion for those at risk.\nOnline holiday booking site for travellers with a disability\nPlanning a holiday or business-related travel is usually more challenging for those with disabilities, who may worry about whether their accommodation will have access ramps for wheelchairs or information in braille, for example.\nA unique online booking system for accessible accommodation may help solve this problem. Developed by a Swedish father whose son suffers from a muscle disease and needs a wheelchair when travelling, Handiscover aims to simplify the search for special accommodation. Simply put, it\u2019s a community-based holiday accommodation-booking website with a unique classification system that allows users to search based on their level of mobility.\n\u2018We take into account issues like the number of stairs, distance to the parking space, the width of doors,\u2019 said Sebastien Archambeaud. \u2018This information makes it easier to choose where to stay.\u2019\nBuilding on Handiscover, he has also launched a secondary website to assist hotels, retail shops and other businesses to better understand accessibility and disability through education workshops.\n\u201c 70% of disabilities aren\u2019t visible. We tend to associate disability with a wheelchair, but don\u2019t forget the visually and hearing impaired. Sebastien Archambeaud, Founder & CEO, and Handiscover leader, https://www.handiscover.com/en-US/ Handiscover\n\u2018With half of the 65+ age group having some form of disability, and 70% of all disabilities not visible, it\u2019s important not to associate disability with a wheelchair,\u2019 noted Archambeaud. \u2018Let\u2019s not forget the visually and hearing impaired.\u2019\nBy placing technology at the heart of building and revamping our cities and transportation systems, digital technology and innovation now have the potential to make life easier for people with disabilities.\nThe research in this article was funded by the EU.

Now, imagine your frustration if, instead of simply dealing with less-than-perfect transport, you had to make do with no transport at all.\nFor many persons with disabilities, this is not just fiction, but a daily struggle that is all too real: a large proportion of urban and inter-urban transport systems remain either completely off-limits or incredibly difficult to use for passengers with disabilities, turning even the shortest trip into a logistical nightmare.\nMobility constraints are a major obstacle to disability-inclusive development, as they exacerbate the economic, social, and personal isolation of persons with disabilities, and tend to push them further into poverty.\nBut the opposite is also true: coupled with interventions in other areas, mobility improvements can go a long way in changing the lives of persons with disabilities for the better. \u201cYou have to think of transport as an equalizer, a catalyst that facilitates access to many other sectors,\u201d said Charlotte McClain-Nhlapo, the World Bank\u2019s Global Advisor on Disability. \u201cMobility improvements are key because transport gives you access to jobs, schools, healthcare, markets, leisure.\u201d\nSupporting disability-inclusive transport through infrastructure financing and knowledge sharing\nAs a key financier of transport infrastructure and a global thought leader on inclusive development, the World Bank has been in a unique position to promote universally accessible transport through a variety of interventions:\nLending operations : transport is the World Bank\u2019s largest sector in terms of overall lending (21% of the institution\u2019s active portfolio), and is also one of the most active when it comes to disability inclusion. The Bank\u2019s experts have been working hand in hand with client countries to integrate the principles of \u201cuniversal design\u201d into transport projects, especially physical upgrades such as access ramps, elevators, tactile surfaces on platforms, braille signage, low-floor vehicles, audio and visual announcements, etc.\n: transport is the World Bank\u2019s largest sector in terms of overall lending (21% of the institution\u2019s active portfolio), and is also one of the most active when it comes to disability inclusion.

In the transport sector, our experts have developed an extensive knowledge base to help stakeholders understand the technical aspects of universally accessible transport.\n: in partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO), the Word Bank released the first-ever World Report on Disability, and will soon be launching a new flagship study on mental health, an issue that is often overlooked in the global conversation about disability. In the transport sector, our experts have developed an extensive knowledge base to help stakeholders understand the technical aspects of universally accessible transport. Training and capacity-building: \u201cCapacity issues can be a serious hurdle in moving from words to action,\u201d pointed out Senior Transport Specialist Julie Babinard. \u201cMany countries do not have specific standards about universally accessible transport. In other cases, transport engineers may be unfamiliar with the complexities of universal design. Finally, it is essential to educate bus drivers, station agents and other staff about the needs of passengers with limited mobility.\u201d\nLegislation and mentalities are changing\nWith the demand for transport infrastructure and services at an all-time high, now is the time to make sure that accessible transport becomes the rule rather than the exception.\nFortunately, awareness of disability is growing and mentalities are changing. \u201cOverall, it has become easier for us to make a case for accessible transport, as our clients understand that, if you want to create sustainable communities, you need to include everyone,\u201d noted Ram\u00f3n Mu\u00f1oz-Raskin, Senior Urban Transport Specialist at the World Bank. \u201cIn many of the countries we work with, universal access is now pretty much a no-brainer, at least for mass transit systems like metro, light rail, or Bus Rapid Transit.\u201d\nThe legislation has evolved as well. The 2006 United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, in particular, provides that: \u201cStates Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access, on an equal basis with others, [\u2026] to transport\u201d (art. 9). The Convention has been ratified by and is legally binding in 160 countries. At the national level, countries across regions and income groups have passed legislation to protect the rights of persons with disabilities.\nData: the new frontier for disability-inclusive transport\nOf course, challenges remain; chief among them is the lack of reliable, disaggregated data on disability and disability-inclusive transport. \u201cWithout statistical evidence, it is much harder to drive policy change and to measure the impact of accessible transport projects,\u201d noted Charlotte McClain-Nhlapo. \u201cHopefully, the 7 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that include disability will create an impetus for more and better data, as progress toward each of the SDGs will have to be clearly measured,\u201d she added.\nConcerns about cost are another persistent hurdle. However, experts agree that the incremental cost of providing universal access is usually minimal in new or \u201cgreenfield\u201d projects, whereas retrofitting existing systems comes with a much heftier price tag. \u201cThat is why accessibility should be factored into projects right from the start; for older systems that can\u2019t be retrofitted, we need to find creative and realistic alternatives,\u201d said Charlotte McClain-Nhlapo.\n\u201cWhen considering the cost of accessibility, you also need to keep in mind that universal design does not just improve the mobility of persons with disabilities, but brings co-benefits to many others: you have to think about the elderly, parents pushing strollers, and all those who may be dealing with temporary physical impairments,\u201d she added.\nLocal communities hold the key to successful projects\nInvolving Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) has been instrumental in securing buy-in from local authorities, for governments tend to pay closer attention to grievances coming from their own constituents (read about Liaoning Medium Cities Infrastructure Project for an interesting example from China).\nIn addition, working with CSOs helps ensure that new projects truly meet the needs of persons with disabilities: when it comes to making transport universally accessible, the devil is most definitely in the detail, and a simple oversight or minor construction flaw can render a whole system unusable.\nInput from local associations of persons with disabilities is critical to making sure that transport systems designed to be accessible have been \u201cused and approved\u201d by those who need them most."}, {"title": "Wheelchair Accessible Transportation Options When Traveling", "article": "For wheelchair users, accessible transportation can become a fundamental consideration when planning a trip. Having accessible options to get around your destination is crucial, specifically for those who struggle to transfer to a vehicle seat or rely on a heavy power wheelchair that is too large to fit in the trunk.\nAt Wheel the World, we are on a continuous search for accessible transportation options to offer our travelers and to build our multi-day trips. Although it can be challenging to find many viable options depending on the destination, many places are becoming increasingly more accessible.\nExploring Your Options\nThere are several options available in most places that can help make transportation more convenient and accessible.

While some destinations may not provide many accessible rental vehicles or ride-shares, others offer exceptional wheelchair accessible public transportation, which may be the best option for traveling within the city. Places like San Fransisco, New York, and Europe as a whole have excellent public transportation. In either case, it is important to research as much as you can so you\u2019re well prepared and know what to expect.\nConnecting with other travelers can be a great resource for preparing for your trip. Ask questions, share your experiences, and connect with like-minded travelers in our Facebook group Wheel the World - Accessible Travel Community.\nWheelchair Accessible Vehicles (WAVs) \u267f\nWhat is a Wheelchair Accessible Vehicle(WAVs) and what does it mean? WAVs are specially designed (or adapted) vehicles of any kind that allows wheelchair users to enter and exit the vehicle with ease. These vehicles have lowered floors and a ramp or lift that allows the wheelchair to be rolled into the vehicle. The interior is designed to accommodate the wheelchair user, with features such as wheelchair tie-downs and accessible controls that allow the user to travel in their wheelchair safely. Some WAVs are also equipped with features such as hand controls for driving, power lifts, and transfer seats to make the transportation experience even more comfortable and convenient for the user.\nAccessible ramps into van.\nWheelchair Accessible Rental Van Services\nFor those who require more specialized transportation, accessible vans can be a great option. These vehicles are designed specifically to accommodate wheelchair users, with features such as wheelchair lifts and tie-downs. Accessible vans can be scheduled through phone or email.\nAt Wheel the World we work with several wheelchair accessible van providers in various destinations around the world, such as Morocco, Chile, Mexico, Costa Rica, France, Spain, Israel, and Qatar, to name a few.\n\u267f Need help with transportation, van rental, and/or insurance for your trip? Request a quote , hear back in less than one business day.\nWAV Options at Ride-Sharing Services\nRide-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft provide accessibility through their WAV option. Typically, the vehicles are minivans or something similar, and the rates are usually the same as a standard UberX. Keep in mind that these aren\u2019t available in every city, so if you\u2019re considering using ride-sharing on your trip, make sure you research to see if it\u2019s a viable option at your destination. At this time, some of the current cities where WAV is offered and has solid availability:\nNew York\nSan Francisco\nPortland\nBoston\nSeattle\nToronto\nWheelchair accessible transportation in Costa Rica\nAccessible Public Transportation\nMany public transportation systems offer wheelchair accessible options, such as buses and trains, while others offer paratransit services for those who are unable to use traditional public transportation. It is important to plan ahead and research the accessibility options in your area because not all public transportation systems are fully accessible.\nIn the U.S, public transportation is not accessible in every destination:\nBus transportation is accessible in almost every city, but can be very ineffective due to the lack of coverage in many cases. Research the bus routes at your destination and see if it would be a good option for you.\nThe San Francisco BART is almost 100% accessible. Every station has elevators, and although they are not very clean, it covers a majority of the city.\nOutside of the U.S there are many cities that we have identified with good public transportation. A few examples are:\nBarcelona, Spain - Great train and bus systems that are fully accessible.\nLondon, England - The buses have great accessibility and the Underground has a number of accessible stations, especially the ones around downtown.\nBerlin, Germany - Most subway stations are accessible.\nSantiago, Chile - The majority of subway stations and buses are accessible. Staying in the Vitacura/Providencia area of the city will allow you to use the subway and buses and go around accessible areas of the city.\nWheelchair lift into public transportation (bus)\nWheelchair Accessible Dispatch Taxis\nWheelchair-accessible dispatch taxi services are another great option for those who require specialized transportation. These services allow users to schedule a ride in an accessible taxi that has been designed to accommodate wheelchair users. These services can be scheduled in advance, allowing you to plan you transportation needs more conveniently. However, it's important to keep in mind that not every destination may offer these services, so it's important to research your options in advance.\nConclusion\nAlthough finding accessible transportation can be a challenge, there are several options available to wheelchair users. By exploring these alternatives, you can find the transportation option that works best for your needs and helps you maintain your independence and mobility.

After all, finding the right place to sit can greatly improve the overall experience. However, finding such accommodations may not always be easy. On the other hand, there are hotels and resorts that go further to meet the needs of people with disabilities by providing wheelchair access, accessible toilets and other essential facilities, but still, many places lack these basic facilities\nWhen choosing accommodations, there are a variety of accessibility factors to consider. First, it can be very helpful to learn more about a hotel\u2019s potential by reading online reviews or contacting them in person. Ask specifically about wheelchair access, elevators or ramps, accessible rooms with adequate toilets, and other services for visitors with disabilities Secondly, it is also important to know where accommodations are available. Appropriate placement of hotels or resorts can reduce the need for extensive transportation systems and make it easier for people with disabilities to enjoy nearby facilities without unnecessary barriers.\nPeople with disabilities can have a hassle-free trip that suits their requirements by prioritizing accessibility when choosing lodgings.

It's the very charm of Europe \u2014 old and well preserved \u2014 that often adds to its barriers. But Europe has made some impressive advances toward opening its doors to everyone, including travelers with limited mobility.\nWherever I go in Europe, I see locals using wheelchairs, scooters, walkers, and canes to get around \u2014 on the streets, in museums, in restaurants, on trains. Even though Europe generally lacks accessibility requirements with the force or scope of the ADA, Europeans with limited mobility are, of course, living rich and full lives. Clearly, travelers with physical disabilities can certainly have an enjoyable and worthwhile vacation there, too.\nAnyone with adventure in their soul can take advantage of what Europe has to offer. Consider your own situation thoughtfully in choosing which attractions to visit, which hotels to sleep in, which restaurants to dine at...and which things you might want to avoid.\nTrip Planning\nJohn Sage owns Sage Traveling, which plans and books accessible travel to Europe for senior and disabled travelers. John has taken his wheelchair to more than 120 European cities and has run into his share of challenges during his travels \u2014 but he also says that the obstacles can almost always be overcome. Here, I've included excerpts, in John's own words, from his top tips for traveling in Europe.\nDo your research. I often hear that \"Venice is not wheelchair accessible\" or \"Paris has poor accessibility.\" While there are certainly some accessibility challenges, the truth is that the more research you do, the more accessible your trip will be. Avoiding bridges in Venice and hills in Paris is entirely possible. Did you know that Herculaneum's ruins are nearly identical to Pompeii's, but are wheelchair-friendly? And that cruise passengers with disabilities can enjoy incredible experiences such as reaching the top of the Acropolis in Athens or entering the Sistine Chapel in Rome by using specially designed wheelchair lifts? Your vacation doesn't need to be a struggle. Do your homework and your trip can be filled with fully accessible hotel accommodations, accessible routes between accessible tourist attractions, and wonderfully accessible travel experiences.\nBook hotels far in advance. It is almost always cheaper to book your accessible hotel accommodation far in advance. And it is also necessary! Many hotels in European city centers have only one or two accessible rooms. The best ones get booked very early. For travel in the summer, make your reservations in December. Remember, a hotel's accessibility status does not only depend on its interior features such as elevators, grab bars and roll-in showers. The location is just as important.\nCarefully plan your route. If you know what you're getting into before you arrive in Europe, you'll have a much easier and enjoyable time on your trip. There'll likely be numerous ways to get to the tourist attractions you're so eager to see. Some routes will have wheelchair ramps, smooth pavement, and flat terrain; others may have steep hills, bothersome (and even dangerous) cobblestones, and flights of stairs. Research the accessibility of sidewalks, bus routes, subway stations, and the location of accessible building entrances before your trip. Check for accessibility information in the online visitors guides for your destinations \u2014 but be aware that not all guides will offer this type of information and some of them may be outdated as access features change all the time.\nStay in the most accessible parts of town. This is one of the hardest parts of planning your trip. You may have found a great accessible hotel, but what will you find when you walk (or roll) out the front door? Are there hills and stairs in all directions? Will you have to roll over cobblestones? Are there accessible restaurants nearby? It's crucial to research the hotel's neighborhood. You can use Google Maps' Street View to get the lay of the land, then email the hotel with your questions.\nFigure out accessible public transportation options. When choosing a hotel, don't forget to factor in the price of transportation. If you have to pay for a taxi to get to accessible restaurants, accessible shopping, and the tourist attractions, that hotel \"deal\" you found won't feel like such a good deal after all. In cities such as London, Paris, and Barcelona, stay near an accessible bus stop. In Berlin, Istanbul, and Venice, stay near an accessible metro, tram, or boat stop. In Florence, Cambridge, and Edinburgh, stay right in the middle of town so you can walk/roll everywhere.\nRely on the experience of other travelers with disabilities. You're certainly not the first person with disabilities to visit Europe. Find out what accessibility challenges other travelers encountered and how they got around them. Check recent posts at travel forums such as Trip Advisor and Cruise Critic to find previous travelers' experiences. Or seek out a travel agent who specializes in accessible travel. You can also find accessibility reviews of multiple European destinations at Sage Traveling.\nHave a backup plan. Even on the most perfectly planned accessible vacation, something can go wrong. If it does, how will you deal with it? If you prepare for all the possible problems, travel with someone who can help you during your trip, and remain flexible, unexpected events won't turn into potential trip-ruining problems. What will you do if a part on your wheelchair breaks? If a train strike occurs in Italy, how will you get from Florence to Rome? With backup plans (such as packing vital spare parts for your wheelchair), you won't have to put your vacation on hold.\nConsider a tour. A company that specializes in accessibility will lead you on the flattest, smoothest, shortest tour routes.\nBefore you take a tour or hire a guide, ask these questions:\nIs the tour guide a licensed professional? How much training has the guide received?\nWhat route will the guide use? Does it involve curbs, steps, steep hills, or cobblestones? Where are the accessible bathrooms located? Will the guide physically assist you if needed (for example, push a manual wheelchair)?\nIs this a private tour, or will you be with other travelers? Are you expected to keep up with more able-bodied tour members?\nHow many people with disabilities have they guided in the past year? (You want a guide who is active enough to be aware of the latest regulations or updates regarding accessibility.)\nAnticipate your trip! You've done as much planning as you can. You've relied on the experience of other travelers with disabilities, and you're prepared for the unexpected. Now it's time to get excited about your trip. Majestic cities, beautiful art and architecture, fascinating history, exquisite food, and wonderful experiences await you.\nMore Tips for Wheelchair Users\nSusan Sygall is the CEO and cofounder of Mobility International USA, a nonprofit that links people with disabilities with work, study, teaching, volunteer, exchange, and research opportunities. It also offers a blog, resource library, and database of disability organizations. Sygall has been traveling the \"Rick Steves way\" for decades. Here, she shares some of her best tips for traveling in Europe with a wheelchair. Thanks to MIUSA's staff for help with this advice.\nPeople who use wheelchairs, like so many of our nondisabled peers, want to get off the tourist track and experience the real France, Italy, or Portugal. Don't accept other people's notions of what is possible \u2014 I have climbed Masada in Israel and made it to the top of the Acropolis in Greece. Whether you travel alone, with friends, or with an assistant, you're in for a great adventure.\nPack light. I use a lightweight manual wheelchair with pop-off tires. I take a backpack that fits on the back of my chair and I store my daypack underneath my chair in a net bag. Since I usually travel alone, if I can't carry it myself, I don't take it.\nPlan for eventualities. I keep a bungee cord with me for the times I can't get my chair into a car and need to strap it in the trunk or when I need to secure it on a train. Bike shops are excellent for tire repairs if you get a flat.\nCheck your chair at the gate. I always insist on keeping my own wheelchair up to the airline gate, where I then check it. When I have a connecting flight, I again insist that I use my own chair.\nDon't let bathroom access stop you. Bathrooms are often a hassle, so I have learned to use creative ways to transfer into narrow spaces. To be blatantly honest, when there are no accessible bathrooms in sight, I have found ways to pee discreetly just about anywhere. You gotta do what you gotta do. Bring along an extra pair of pants and a great sense of humor.\nLook for freight elevators. If a museum lacks elevators for visitors, be sure to ask about freight elevators. Almost all have them somewhere, and that can be your ticket to seeing a world-class treasure.\nLet wheelchairs help you. People who have difficulty walking long distances may want to bring a lightweight wheelchair or borrow or rent one when needed.\nInsist on your rights. Don't confuse being flexible and having a positive attitude with settling for less than your rights. I expect equal access and constantly let people know about the possibility of providing access through ramps or other modifications. When I believe my rights have been violated, I do whatever is necessary to remedy the situation, so that the next traveler or disabled person in that country won't have the same frustrations.\nBreak down barriers. Try to learn some of the language of the country you're in. It cuts through the barriers when people stare at you (and they will), and also comes in handy when you need help going up a curb or a flight of steps.\nLearn from locals. Remember that you are part of a global family of people with disabilities. Always get information about disability groups in the places you are going. See the sidebar in this page for a number of helpful organizations. They have the best access information, and many times they'll become your new traveling partners and friends.\nWhat Accessibility Means in Europe\nThis section was contributed by Carole Zoom, who has traveled to more than 30 countries with her scooter-style electric wheelchair and ventilator.\nThe concept of accessibility varies by culture. In the US, access means that an individual can use elevators, lifts, doors, entrances, and other features without any assistance. Individual autonomy is central to the American concept of access, as enshrined in the ADA.\nEurope, on the other hand, subscribes to a medical rather than political model of disability. Policy tends to be focused on helping people with disabilities navigate a society built for nondisabled individuals \u2014 instead of helping society find ways to accommodate their needs. For example, in Europe an entryway with one step is considered accessible: The law assumes that disabled people will use manual wheelchairs that can be rolled up a step and/or will have family members assisting.\nIn the US it's illegal to discriminate based on what kind of mobility device a wheelchair user chooses. But in Europe, mobility scooter users have fewer rights than wheelchair users; scooters are seen not as a medical necessity, but as a convenience item for people who can still walk to some extent. Scooter-style wheelchairs are not allowed in some museums and other public facilities \u2014 you may be asked to walk if you can or to transfer to a manual wheelchair. If those are not options for you, be persistent in explaining your situation to museum staff.\nGiven the age of many buildings in Europe, elevator access is often not a reality. A US citizen would assume a hotel is accessible upon hearing that it has an elevator. But many older European elevators are not large enough for American-style electric wheelchairs and scooters. Before you book a room, ask the hotel concierge for photos and exact measurements to ensure your style and size of wheelchair will fit. A hotel that hesitates to provide the info or photos you request is unlikely to be accommodating; in that case, move on and choose another.\nUnlike in the US, European transit companies that operate planes, ships, trains, and buses may require advanced documentation of disability. If you need specific assistance, have your doctor fill out forms attesting to your needs before you travel, then contact the transit provider's medical desk at least 72 hours before your departure to ask how to submit them. Always confirm and reconfirm your reservations for assistance on all modes of advanced-ticketed transport.\nWe have an increasingly barrier-free world.

Depending on the type of disability, accommodations can look many different ways \u2014 from transcription services to accessible parking outside the office. In this guide, we\u2019ll share more about reasonable accommodations, examples, and how to request them in your job search or at your first job.\nWhat Are Reasonable Accommodations at Work?\nWork accommodations are changes to a hiring process, work environment, or job responsibilities that allow an employee with a disability to apply for or do their job.\nWhat makes an accommodation \u201creasonable?\u201d An accommodation is \u201creasonable\u201d if it doesn\u2019t create an undue hardship on the employer \u2014 meaning it isn\u2019t exceptionally difficult or expensive for the employer to make the accommodation.\nNot every employee with a disability needs the same accommodation; accommodations depend on the individual\u2019s needs and how it affects their ability to do their job. For example, reasonable accommodations can include:\nTechnical access, like an employee with impaired hearing who uses a transcription service\nPhysical accommodations, like a ramp for the office to make it accessible to an employee in a wheelchair\nChanges to work schedules, like more flexible hours for an employee who has mental health challenges and may need more rest periods\nThese accommodations make it so every employee, regardless of ability, can succeed in their job.\nPower BI Passionate about advocating for employees with disabilities and other underrepresented groups in the workplace?

Some common reasonable accommodations include:\nChange of job tasks\nFlexible work schedules, including remote jobs\nImproved office accessibility\nSpecialized software or equipment\nAlternative supervisory structure or methods\nAlternative formats of communication (written versus verbal communication, for example)\nReassignment\nHere\u2019s how some of these accommodations function for various disabilities.\nADHD\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that can affect an employee\u2019s ability to focus, prioritize tasks, stay organized, and control impulses. In the workplace, accommodations for ADHD allow these employees to be productive in a way that works for them \u2014 mainly through adjustments to work schedules and environments.\nExamples of ADHD accommodations at work include:\nA flexible schedule that allows an employee to work when their energy and focus levels are best\nA private or quiet workspace so an employee can work distraction-free\nTask organization tools or software to help an employee prioritize and stay on task\nAdjustments to meetings to make them shorter, have more breaks, and provide a clear agenda beforehand\nMental Health\nMental health conditions like depression and anxiety can affect an employee\u2019s ability to be productive, work closely with others, and work on a typical 9-5 schedule.\nExamples of reasonable accommodations for mental health conditions include:\nFlexible work schedules for an employee who needs to take time during the workday for treatment\nRemote work for an employee who experiences intense social anxiety\nPermission to bring a support animal to the office\nSupportive and direct supervision style for an employee who needs positive reinforcement and feedback\nA quiet work environment, either by providing a space for the employee to work distraction-free or technology like noise-canceling headphones\nPhysical Disabilities\nReasonable accommodations for physical disabilities vary widely and depend on the kind of physical disability a person has. For example, a blind employee and an employee in a wheelchair need very different accommodations to perform their jobs.\nExamples of reasonable accommodations for physical disabilities include:\nAssistive technology, like screen readers, voice recognition software, Braille displays, and specialized input devices to help an employee process or communicate information\nAdjustable workstations for an employee with a physical impairment\nWheelchair accessible offices\nFlexible work arrangements, including working from home, for employees who find it challenging to commute or need time for treatment\nAdjusting job tasks that require physical labor\nDiabetes\nEmployees with diabetes may experience a range of symptoms depending on how their diabetes affects them. For example, some employees may have diabetic neuropathy, a nerve disorder caused by diabetes that affects nerves in the hands and feet. Others may experience diabetic retinopathy, an eye condition that can affect vision.\nExamples of reasonable accommodations for diabetes include:\nFlexible work schedules or regular breaks to check blood glucose levels, eat, take medication, or go to the bathroom\nAccess to technology to regularly check blood glucose levels\nPermission to use a chair or stool for an employee with diabetic neuropathy\nA larger screen, screen readers, or Braille displayers for an employee with diabetic retinopathy\nPregnancy\nPregnancy is not a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); however, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA) is a new law that requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations to employees who experience limitations because of pregnancy, childbirth, or other related medical conditions. These work accommodations include adjustments to work schedules and changes to job tasks.\nExamples of reasonable accommodations for pregnancy in the PWFA include:\nFlexible hours or additional time to eat and rest\nAccess to accessible parking spots\nLeave or time off to recover from childbirth\nExcusal from strenuous physical activity or activities that may expose an employee to compounds not safe for pregnancy\nPregnancy and Breastfeeding\nWhile the PWFA does not have any specific guidance about breast milk pumping, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) specifically covers nursing mothers in the workplace.\nThe PPACA includes two main reasonable accommodations:\nBreak time for an employee to express breast milk, up to one year after giving birth\nA private place out of view and free of intrusion, other than a bathroom, to express breast milk\nReturn to Work for Parents and Carers Coming back from parental or caregiving leave?

According to the ADA National Network, you\u2019re allowed to request \u2014 and must gain access to \u2014 reasonable accommodations at work, as long as:\nYou\u2019re qualified for the position, meaning you\u2019re able to perform the job\u2019s essential functions\nYou meet the definition of \u201cdisability\u201d according to the ADA, meaning you have a \u201cphysical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities\u201d\nThe accommodation doesn\u2019t create an undue burden on the employer, meaning an exceptional difficulty or expense\nReasonable Accommodation Request Process\nReasonable accommodations, by law, must be addressed on a case-by-case basis. According to the ADA Network, the process is as follows:\nAn employee must disclose their disability to their employer and explain how the disability is affecting their ability to do their job. The employee and employer discuss how the disability is affecting the employee\u2019s ability to work and share potential solutions. If the employee\u2019s need for an accommodation is not obvious, the employer can request preliminary documentation of the disability. The employee and employer both provide input on what an effective solution would be. The employer makes the final decision on what the accommodation(s) will be. The employer either implements the accommodation(s) or denies the accommodation request.\nIt\u2019s up to the employee to bring their accommodation request to the employer. While the employer does have the final say, if an employee has a disability, it\u2019s their right to receive reasonable accommodations. They should actively participate in discussions on what those accommodations should be.\nHow to Request Reasonable Accommodations When You\u2019re Just Starting Out\nSo, you\u2019re thinking of requesting reasonable accommodations, whether you\u2019re in your first job search or have just landed your first role. We\u2019ve outlined the step-by-step process, but how should those conversations go?\nIt\u2019s best to be proactive and straightforward while focusing on how you\u2019ll be able to thrive in the role.\n\u201cThe best way is to confront and call out the problem and your expectations directly,\u201d says Roza Szafranek, founder and CEO at HR Hints. \u201cIt is good to clearly name from the beginning what is important to us and ask, for example, about arrangements for hybrid work, the need to work with a mask in common spaces, or the distance between desks in the office, if these are important to us.\u201d\nRequest Examples\nKraig Kleeman, CEO and founder of The New Workforce, a company that connects businesses with talent, gives an example of how someone on the job hunt with ADHD \u2014 who knows they might need extra breaks during the day \u2014 might request accommodations.\n>>MORE: How Can You Tell if an Employer Values Diversity and Inclusion in the Workplace?\n\u201cResearch the companies you\u2019re applying to and check if they have info on accommodations on their websites,\u201d Kleeman says. \u201cOnce you get an offer, that\u2019s the time to discuss your needs.

Share what you need to thrive in your role. It\u2019s a collaboration; you and your employer work together to make it happen. Be ready with any required documents and keep a positive attitude. Focus on how you can rock your new job.\u201d\nWhat to Do If an Employer Denies Your Reasonable Accommodation Request\nUnfortunately, not all reasonable accommodation requests will be approved.\n\u201cApplication rejection happens often,\u201d Szafranek says. \u201cThe most common reasons are savings and lack of willingness or ability to take on more responsibilities in terms of managing the problems of the employed team. Company and team leaders are focusing on optimizing and simplifying everything that does not bring additional revenue and increases the efficiency of the team\u2019s work, so if they consider that, for example, they are unable to negotiate work from the office, they will not budge.\u201d\nWhile an employer might feel strongly that their decision is final, you can try to negotiate a rejection or take further action.\n\u201cIf they do say no, don\u2019t lose heart,\u201d Kleeman says. \u201cTalk to them, explain why it\u2019s essential, and try to work something out. It\u2019s a two-way street. If you do take further action, contact the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for help. They can mediate or investigate. If all else fails, you can consider legal action. But remember, that\u2019s usually the last resort. So, don\u2019t be afraid to speak up and advocate for your needs.

In disability employment antidiscrimination law and policy, perhaps the most important driver of the inclusion command is the \u201caccommodation principle,\u201d which requires that employers make reasonable adjustments to tasks and places of work to enable full and equal participation by qualified individuals with disabilities [2].\nIn the seminal 2004 U.S. Supreme Court case Tennessee v. Lane [3], the late Justice Ruth Ginsburg wrote of the centrality of the ADA\u2019s accommodation principle:\nIncluding individuals with disabilities among people who count in composing \u201cWe the People,\u201d Congress understood in shaping the ADA, would sometimes require not blindfolded equality, but responsiveness to difference; not indifference, but accommodation. Central to the Act\u2019s primary objective, Congress extended the statute\u2019s range to reach all government activities, [], and required \u2026 \u201creasonable accommodations.\u201d\nUnder the ADA, the word \u201cdiscriminate\u201d consequently includes failure to make reasonable accommodations to the physical and mental limitations of a qualified individual with a disability, in the absence of an \u201cundue hardship\u201d on the business [1]. Discrimination includes denying opportunities to a job applicant or employee if such denial is based on the need for the entity to make reasonable accommodations to that person\u2019s physical or mental conditions [1]. By directing employers to accept responsibility, within reason, for accommodations (up to the undue hardship ceiling), the ADA\u2019s Title I sets the ADA apart from other U.S. civil rights legislation.\nThe importance of the accommodation principle to disability inclusive employment law and policy is manifest [4]. The goal of offering equal employment opportunity to everyone, regardless of disability, is meaningless if the new hire uses a wheelchair and the sole entrance to the workplace is up a flight of stairs. The right to work rings hollow if people who are deaf or hard of hearing, who are blind or have low vision, or who have reading or cognitive disabilities cannot use or access a company\u2019s web-based technologies [5]. Opportunity is foreclosed when an employer will not alter work schedules within reason, or bars telework or remote work, without consideration for qualified individuals with episodic or mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety, that require flexibility [6].\nTitle I of the ADA defines the accommodation principle to include, within reason, making facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, as well as job restructuring, part-time and modified work schedules, remote work and telecommuting, modification of equipment and devices, and other effective means of enabling qualified individuals with disabilities to perform essential functions of their jobs, whether traditional or non-traditional [1]. The ADA gives substantial weight to an employer\u2019s definition of \u201cessential\u201d job functions and the extent to which such tasks may be done effectively with accommodation.\nResearch shows the low costs and the numerous benefits of the accommodation principle. Most workplace accommodations incur de minimis or near-zero costs [7,8,9,10]. Employers in most cases can accommodate people with disabilities with relative ease, formally or informally. Further, there are far-reaching, positive ripple effects from a \u201cculture of accommodation\u201d for all [11, 12]. At the organizational level, accommodations improve employee productivity, morale, and tenure. If an organization promotes a \u201cculture of inclusion,\u201d a climate of flexible and supportive approaches, it furthers effective and innovative accommodations and productive outcomes for all employees and for itself [9, 10, 13,14,15], and it enjoys the benefits of attracting and retaining qualified workers [13]. The ripple effect extends even further: promoting economic opportunity for people with disabilities produces a corresponding decrease in their need for federal disability insurance and other governmental support funding, along with a resultant increase in tax revenues.\nThe research thus suggests the value, to all of society, of documenting, devising, and promoting strategies to increase awareness and implementation of the accommodation principle across organizations of different sizes and types, and across market and labor sectors.\nAt the thirtieth anniversary of the ADA, the articles in this special topic section consider, variously, the future of disability-inclusive employment in light of how the accommodation principle works in contemporary society, and in light of its historical precedents. The accommodation principle as part of a disability inclusive employment paradigm is a concept of the late twentieth century. It contrasts with earlier vocational rehabilitation programs for people with disabilities, which historically were based on medicalized conceptions of disability [1, 16]. This \u201cMedical Model\u201d of disability focused on individual deficits, with impairments conceived of as infirmities that precluded participation in the mainstream economy [17, 18]. It cast people with disabilities in a subordinate role to doctors, rehabilitation professionals, and governmental bureaucrats, each of whom aimed to \u201chelp them,\u201d when \u201cdeserving,\u201d adjust to a society structured around the convenience, design, and interests of people without disabilities [17].\nIn contrast, the modern model is the Social Model of disability, which is sometimes called the Ecological Model, and, in the context of the ADA, the Disability Civil Rights Model. This model, however named, includes the accommodation principle. It has changed society\u2019s perspective. It has altered the historical paradigm from a focus on a health status to be cured or rehabilitated, and even pitied, towards acceptance of individual differences as human traits that are accommodated in employment, and generally in society, as a natural part of the human experience.\nThe Social Model of disability has taken on exceptional importance due to the health and economic emergency arising from the global pandemic [19, 20]. The pandemic is challenging public and private entities in unprecedented ways to spur both traditional and new forms of employment and economic opportunity for all. But people with disabilities are presently experiencing among the highest rates of job loss, as compared to those without disabilities, from the health and economic emergency [21, 22].\nLest we forget, too, people with disabilities often own or identify with multiple minority identities that are themselves marginalized in our society. People with disabilities, for example, may also be women, people of color, and/or individuals identifying with different sexual orientations and gender identities [23,24,25]. Disability diversity and inclusion (\u201cD&I\u201d) programs that incorporate the accommodation principle for all identities\u2014what my colleagues call \u201cD&I+\u201d\u2014are crucial to people with disabilities who seek to enter or re-enter the mainstream economy."}, {"title": "Accommodations", "article": "Under Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), a reasonable accommodation is a modification or adjustment to a job, the work environment, or the way things are usually done during the hiring process. These modifications enable an individual with a disability to have an equal opportunity not only to get a job, but successfully perform their job tasks to the same extent as people without disabilities. The ADA requires reasonable accommodations as they relate to three aspects of employment: 1) ensuring equal opportunity in the application process; 2) enabling a qualified individual with a disability to perform the essential functions of a job; and 3) making it possible for an employee with a disability to enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment.\nAccommodations are sometimes referred to as \u201cproductivity enhancers\u201d. Reasonable accommodations should not be viewed as \u201cspecial treatment\u201d and they often benefit all employees. For example, facility enhancements such as ramps, accessible restrooms, and ergonomic workstations benefit more than just employees with disabilities. Examples of reasonable accommodations include making existing facilities accessible; job restructuring; part-time or modified work schedules; acquiring or modifying equipment; changing tests, training materials, or policies; and providing qualified readers or interpreters. Here are some more examples. Many job accommodations cost very little and often involve minor changes to a work environment, schedule or work-related technologies:\nPhysical changes Installing a ramp or modifying a rest room Modifying the layout of a workspace\nAccessible and assistive technologies Ensuring computer software is accessible Providing screen reader software Using videophones to facilitate communications with colleagues who are deaf\nAccessible communications Providing sign language interpreters or closed captioning at meetings and events Making materials available in Braille or large print\nPolicy enhancements Modifying a policy to allow a service animal in a business setting Adjusting work schedules so employees with chronic medical conditions can go to medical appointments and complete their work at alternate times or locations\nThese are just a few example.

And these travelers represent, according to the Amadeus Accessibility Study, a \"$70 billion market\" just in Europe and the USA.\nThis fact alone would make a strong business case for investing time, effort, and resources needed to become more accessible and inclusive as a business and as an industry.

Parents traveling with small kids. Travelers with allergies and other medical conditions. These are all different types of travelers who have different degrees of accessibility restrictions and mobility requirements.\nAnd a large proportion of travelers with disabilities have \"invisible\" impairments (such as cognitive or mental health conditions and long-term illnesses) that may not be, unlike wheelchair users, immediately obvious just by looking at them.\nWhen planning for and communicating about the accessibility features and services you provide, therefore, rather than simply using the \"handicap symbol\" (the ubiquitously used sign of a wheelchair user - the top-left pictogram on the above image), these various areas of accessibility needs must be considered and appropriately indicated.\nShare on your website and brochures, for example, if you provide assistive listening devices on your tour, or if sign language interpretation is available within any of the attractions you visit.\n\"Tourism for All\" is a concept that is addressing a growing segment of travelers with a diverse range of needs and requirements. What is \"accessible\" to one traveler who is a wheelchair user, for example, may be very difficult to access or completely inaccessible to another traveler with a different type of disability, mobility impairment or other conditions.\nThat's why becoming more inclusive is a more appropriate goal for the tourism industry than focusing just on \"accessible tourism\" (which can be vague and hard to define - accessible for whom?).\nAn inclusive tourism business or destination works to offer positive travel experiences to people with different needs by addressing them from various perspectives, and by providing design and service solutions that aim to cover as many different groups as possible.\nUniversal Design: Designing for Everyone, Being a Good Host\nWhen it comes to being inclusive and promoting Tourism for All, a key concept that underlies the solutions to be implement by tourism businesses and destinations is Universal Design.\nThe definition of Universal Design is as follows:\nUniversal Design is the design and composition of an environment so that it can be accessed, understood and used to the greatest extent possible by all people regardless of their age, size, ability or disability. An environment (or any building, product, or service in that environment) should be designed to meet the needs of all people who wish to use it. This is not a special requirement, for the benefit of only a minority of the population. It is a fundamental condition of good design. If an environment is accessible, usable, convenient and a pleasure to use, everyone benefits.\n- Centre for Excellence in Universal Design, \" What is Universal Design\nTo understand where you need to improve in order to offer universally accessible experience for everyone's benefit, take some time to reflect on the whole customer journey from the perspectives of guests with different access needs and mobility requirements.\nThink about how they experience travel - from the customer finding your business, to booking their trip, to arriving in your destination, to getting around during their stay.\nAre there steps to enter the restaurant that will make it difficult for customers with limited mobility? Does your hotel offer an accessible and easy-to-follow process for guests with disabilities to check in/out and get around within the property? And is your website designed for users with different needs (e.g. individuals with hearing or vision impairment)?\nBusinesses often have barriers that make it difficult for customers with particular access or mobility impairments to enjoy a certain product or service, because of the lack of awareness that those barriers exist.\nAnd in some cases, businesses may be \"rejecting\" prospective customers without ever knowing. The 2016 Click-Away Pound study found that \"71% of customers with access needs will click away from a website that they find difficult to use\".\nWith all the different types of accessibility requirements, it may seem difficult or impossible to anticipate and accommodate the various needs of your customers. But it's important to remember that in tourism we are in the business of providing services to welcome guests; and that it is in fact your responsibility as a host to cater to the needs of your guests and to make them feel welcome.\nIt's part of being a good host.\nBy considering the diverse needs and abilities of all throughout the design process, universal design creates products, services and environments that meet peoples' needs. Simply put, universal design is good design. - Centre for Excellence in Universal Design, \"What is Universal Design\"\nInclusive Growth and Sustainable Development\nWith the growing importance of the accessible tourism market, and especially the spending power of this market segment including the \"multiplier effect\" (each traveler with impairment is likely to influence the purchase decisions of multiple members of their party), there is a strong economic imperative to be considered. To remain competitive, your tourism business and destination should be investing in universal design and inclusive solutions.\nBeyond the economic imperative, however, there are also key reasons why inclustive tourism should be part of the global sustainable tourism agenda.\nWith an estimated 15% of the world population living with some forms of disabilities (World Health Organization, World Report on Disability 2011), and the changing demographic of the \"rapidly ageing\" populations around the world (WHO, Aging and Life Course), sustainable development can only be achieved through an inclusive approach to creating solutions and opportunities.\nThe United Nations' \"Disability and Development Report: Realizing the Sustainable Development Goals by, for and with persons with disabilities\" (2018) recognizes that \"striving to achieve disability-inclusive development is not only the right thing to do, it is also the practical thing to do,\" as \"the success of the 2030 Agenda requires a participatory and inclusive approach in which all stakeholders, including persons with disabilities, are engaged.\"\nAnd that's why Tourism for All is highlighted in the Global Sustainable Tourism Criteria, the baseline standard for sustainability in travel and tourism.\nSource: Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC)\nAnd in the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO)'s Global Code of Ethics for Tourism.\nSource: UNWTO, Global Code of Ethics for Tourism\nInclusion in the Work Place\nHaving understood the importance of striving for universal design and working towards becoming more inclusive, what can tourism businesses do to get started? What are some of the first steps?\nOne of the key challenges when considering steps to becoming more inclusive is to understand the diverse needs of your customers and your prospective customers. The barriers that prevent some people from having a positive travel experience - whether they may be steps that cannot be climbed, signs that cannot be read, or buttons that cannot be reached - are hard to notice unless you put yourself in the position of those with particular disabilities and impairments.\nOne of the most effective ways for businesses to understand the various accessibility needs of their customers is to have team members who know and represent the perspectives of those customers. In short, hire people with disabilities. Empower them to help make your business more inclusive, both within your operations and through your products and services.\nThe UNWTO report \"Recommendations on Accessible Tourism\" (2013) states that \"the staff of tourism establishments and related services should be prepared to know, understand and address the needs of customers with disabilities\", and \"the staff should include employees who know how to communicate with persons with sensory disabilities.\"\n\"The hospitality industry serves travellers from all over the world. The diversity of cultures implies a diversity of customer expectations as well. The hotels with a diverse workforce to cater to such a wide customer base hold a strong competitive advantage over others. ... [To] have employees that understand the needs and requirements of the customers and provide key insights into making properties progressively accessible is also a crucial element of the overall business strategy.\" - Hospitality Workers Training Centre, \"Disability Inclusion in the Hospitality Industry Makes Business Sense\"\nBusiness Examples: Staff Diversity and Inclusion\nLemon Tree Hotels Limited, India\nWinner of the 2019 Tourism for Tomorrow Awards, in the category \"Investing in People\", Lemon Tree Hotels have focused on creating a socially inclusive work environment, bringing together people of different backgrounds, abilities and ethnicities to work as a unified team with a common goal. Lemon Tree supports \"opportunity deprived\" workers, including those with physical, social or economic disabilities, by creating and offering opportunities to realize their full potential and live with dignity.\nIlunion Hotels, Spain\nFifty percent of ILUNION Hotels' employees have disabilities. The hotel is committed to integrating its approach to universal accessibility not just in its services for customers with disabilities, but also throughout its business model, including its employees and suppliers. Illunion Hotels received the 2016 UNWTO Ethics Award for its work in the area of accessible tourism for all and its contribution to change attitudes, break down social barriers and make the accommodation industry more inclusive.\nEinsmehr Hotel\nPhoto: hoteleinsmehr\nLocated in Augsburg, Germany, Einsmehr Hotel is an inclusive hotel with about half of its workforce consisting of people with disabilities.

Experiencing a voyage on Tenacious (or her sister ship Lord Nelson) is an object lesson in the benefits of inclusion and accessibility. People living with a disability can challenge themselves, experience adventure and explore what they are capable of given the opportunity, while able-bodied crew members are shown that disability doesn\u2019t necessarily mean incapacity.\" - Martin Heng, \"Setting sail for accessible adventure on the SV Tenacious\" (Lonely Planet)\nThis amazing example of SV Tenacious is a good reason for all of us in the tourism industry to be asking, as Martin challenges us, \"If they can do this, what excuse do we have not to make mainstream tourism operations more accessible?\"\nSo a better question here, instead of \u201cHow can tourism become more inclusive?\u201d, may be, \u201cwhat are we not (yet) doing to make tourism more inclusive, and how are we going to push for change?\""}, {"title": "The Concepts of Design for All and Universal Design", "article": null}, {"title": "UNWTO, ONCE Foundation and ENAT - Delivering Accessible Tourism for All", "article": "UNWTO, ONCE Foundation and ENAT - Delivering Accessible Tourism for All\nThe World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) will continue to build on its successful partnership with the Spanish ONCE Foundation and the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT). The three parties have agreed to extend their partnership agreement for a further four years to ensure that their work to improve accessibility, in every part of the tourism value chain, continues during and beyond the pandemic.\nThe joint work will continue to focus on the promotion of good practices during the current crisis, the application of standards, the measurement of accessible tourism, as well as labour inclusion and institutional disability inclusive policies. The three partners are currently collecting success stories of destinations and companies which have adopted new sanitary protocols to facilitate access to travel and tourism for all, including both residents and visitors. In line with the key UNWTO Recommendations released early on during the pandemic, the Accessibility Champions initiative is still open for submissions illustrating how the guidelines to restart tourism without imposing new obstacles are being successfully implemented. The most outstanding cases will be promoted by the partners through an e-publication and webinars.\nThe three partners are also committed to raising awareness of the forthcoming ISO Standard on Tourism for All. All three have worked with the International Standardization Organization (ISO) on the new requirements and recommendations. The ISO standard will represent a milestone, being the first global standard aimed at implementing and improving accessibility throughout the tourism value chain.\nThe awareness-raising work will sensitize institutions, governments and service providers o the importance of accessibility for all and inclusion. It will make clear that this is not only a question of human rights and equal opportunities, but also a major competitive advantage for destinations and the private sector.\nUNWTO, the ONCE Foundation and ENAT jointly state: \u201cAccessibility for all is about service quality, innovation and comfort for all tourists, new sources of revenue and new clients with disabilities, seniors and families with young children, among many other individuals, with specific access requirements. By adopting Universal Design principles in the development of environments and services, the tourism sector can fulfil its moral responsibility and, in many countries, legal obligations to cater to those with specific requirements, making tourism for all a reality.\u201d\nRelated Links"}, {"title": "The World's Best Accessible Hotels", "article": "1\nIt starts with a booking\nIt starts with a booking\nThe only way to leave a review is to first make a booking.

This means that the hotel room is designed to accommodate individuals with reduced mobility or people with any kind of disability. It should be in the hands of the hotel to properly make their rooms within reach of all target audiences, whether your country makes it a requirement or not.\nIn this article, we\u2019ll look at what is an accessible hotel room and the eight elements that a hotel room must include in order to be able to be inclusive and accommodate any kind of guest.\nWhat is an accessible hotel room?\nWhile in a perfect world, all hotel rooms would be made to suit any kind of guest, the idea of an accessible hotel room is that there are special accommodations made for guests with any kind of disabilities, including individuals with impaired vision, those with hearing loss, and reduced mobility. This means that the room is designed while thinking about the needs of this kind of client so that they can move around in the room comfortably.\nIn some countries, like the United States, hotels are obligated to have a certain percentage of their rooms be accessible, across different floors and for different room types. This means that these rooms that are created for people with disabilities are required to include roll-in showers, toilets with bars on the sides, wide entryways to accommodate wheelchair maneuvering and other elements that we will discuss in more detail below.\nEight elements that accessible hotel rooms must include\nWhile there are many types of disabilities, as a hotelier, it is your responsibility to create an inclusive hotel that is welcoming to all individuals no matter their degree or kind of disability. This can be done by creating smart rooms that help use technology to make rooms more accessible with elements like voice technology. We will look at some of the key elements that these types of rooms must include so that they can be hospitable for all guests.\nVoice technology is an excellent tool to contribute to accessibility because this way your guests can control light switches, put on music or the television, and use the virtual concierge services activated by voice. Read more about voice technology. For those who are hearing impaired, you can implement smart mirrors and other smart technology with these kinds of guests in mind.\n1. Spacious and clutter-free\nSpaciousness is essential to provide adequate space for people in wheelchairs to move around the room freely. This also means that there shouldn\u2019t be any obstacles in their way like carpets or elements wheelchairs could get stuck on. Ideally, for better traction, the rooms should have hardwood floors. The same goes for the visually impaired, there shouldn\u2019t be any obstacles that might get in their way from moving around the room comfortably.\nThe best way to avoid possible hurdles is to have a room that is clutter-free with a simple layout, and minimal furniture to make it as easy as possible to navigate around the room.\n2. Automatic doors\nAutomatic doors are essential, especially for individuals in a wheelchair. There should be an automatic door when entering and exiting the room, and ideally, a power door assist as hotel room doors tend to be very heavy. When possible, automatic doors should also be in the entry to your hotel so that people can easily enter and exit the hotel without help. Learn more about lobby design.\n3. Adjustable beds\nWhether your guests need a hoyer lift or not to get into bed, it\u2019s important to have a bed with an adjustable height that can accommodate any kind of guest. This will also mean that you have the dimensions and height of the bed documented, so your staff is able to answer these important questions. Knowing this height, guests can more easily understand if they will be able to lift themselves into the bed or will need assistance.\nYou may also like:\n4. Roll-in shower and bars\nA roll-in shower means that the shower should be quite spacious without any steps or obstacles in the way, so people in wheelchairs can get in and out of the shower without any problems. The shower should also have a bench and bars in the shower and next to the toilet. The bathroom should have a panic button installed should they need help.\n5. Buzzer and light\nA buzzer and light are necessary for guests who are hearing impaired. The buzzer should be placed outside and a flashing light inside so that they know someone is at the door. The buzzer is also helpful for the visually impaired because they can hear when someone is at the door.\n6. Plugs\nWhile plugs should never be an obstacle for guests with disabilities, it\u2019s important that they are able to easily utilize the plugs, which should ideally be located between 15-48 inches (30-120 cm). The idea is to have the plugs more or less at waist height so that they can be easily reached. There should also be plugs on the desks, on the night stands and in the lamp bases.\n7. Suite set-up\nAs a hotelier it\u2019s important to have different types of rooms be accessible, that means that also suites are set up for people with disabilities, since they often travel with caregivers. These caregivers should be easily able to access the main room, but both parties should have privacy.\n8. Ability to remove items when necessary\nAs a hotelier you want your rooms to be decorated to perfection, However, in the case of accessible rooms, it\u2019s important that this decoration be flexible. That means that furniture can be easily moved or removed in order to accommodate your guests\u2019 needs. Excessive design elements that may get in the way, on the other hand, should be given extra thought if they really contribute or detract from the room\u2019s accessibility features.\nConclusion\nBy implementing these eight tips to make an accessible hotel room, you can be sure that your rooms will create an optimal guest experience by considering the needs of all your hotel guests. Make sure your front desk staff is trained on the different features of your accessible rooms so that they are prepared to answer any questions that come at them. Learn more about building the perfect hotel staff.\nYour staff should also be prepared to provide reasonable accommodations for guests with disabilities, like removing or moving furniture around, or relocating elements within the room to more accessible positions. The key to designing an accessible hotel room is a simple layout, minimal furniture, spaciousness and the ability to provide flexibility."}, {"title": "16 of the best UK hotels with accessible rooms", "article": "Disabled access is a human right and it\u2019s important that people with disabilities are allowed to travel freely.

Check your travel insurance\nFrustratingly, travel insurance costs more simply because you have a disability \u2014 but it\u2019s very important to get the right cover; listing long-term medical conditions and chronic illnesses will save you a fortune if you need medical attention on holiday. Remember that additional insurance to protect mobility aids may also be needed.

Pack enough medication\nAnd check that you can take it into the country you\u2019re visiting. Remembering your medication could be the difference between a good break away and a bad one.

Check you\u2019re fit to fly\nYour GP should also help check that you\u2019re fit to fly. Don\u2019t forget any extras you may need to take with you such as compression socks, spare feeding tubes or masks.\n5. Get a free (or discounted) space for your carer or PA\nTravelling often means having to take a personal assistant with you and if you need multiple carers this can soon add up. Thankfully, you can get discounts \u2014 and often get free spaces. Eurostar, for example, only has wheelchair spaces in standard premier or business class but you will get these at the price of standard tickets; this includes one seat at standard price for your carer too.\n6. Remember all your mobility aids\nMany of us use different mobility aids for different days. If you\u2019re an ambulatory wheelchair user, are you also going to need to take a walking stick with you? Do you need different mobility aids to cover all terrains you might experience on your trip?\nAn airport lift for passengers who use wheelchairs (Getty Images)\n7. Familiarise yourself with the procedure for checking-in mobility aids\nDon\u2019t panic about being without your wheels when flying. Your wheelchair will be stored with the luggage and you\u2019ll be given another to transport you around airports at either end and to and from your seat. If your personal wheelchair or mobility aid comes with specialist storage instructions or needs to be handled in a certain way, make sure the airline knows and you know where, when and how your mobility aid will be returned to you.\n8. Use websites like AccessAble to plan your trip\nAccessAble provides full reviews and information about everything from where the accessible public toilets are in a city to which hotels offer accessible spa access. Plan ahead, including where you are going to eat, and make sure any companies you book through are aware of your access needs and have ramps, working lifts, braille menus and anything else you may require.\nEuan\u2019s Guide provides similar reviews and allows disabled people to leave reviews of different aspects of their visit to certain attractions, so you can get a first-hand account of what you\u2019re about to experience.\n9. Use a specialist travel agents\nSome travel agents, such as Travel Counsellors, specialise in creating incredible accessible travel experiences. If you\u2019re unsure where to even begin, use a specialist agency who can cover everything for you from booking your transfers to and from the hotel to whether the swimming pool has a hoist to which spas have wheelchair accessible treatment rooms.\n10. Consider renting a mobility device\nMany hotels, museums, cruise ships and holiday resorts have mobility scooters and wheelchairs that you can often rent free of charge or for a small fee. Airport assistance will be able to transport you around the airport in a wheelchair or on a buggy and, once you arrive at your destination, check out the range of mobility aids on offer to help get you round the resort.\nMake sure your hotel room has space for your service animal to work, rest and play (Alamy)\n11. Make sure your accommodation has enough room for your service animal\nIf you\u2019re travelling with a service animal, such as a guide dog, make sure the hotel room you\u2019re provided with has enough room for your animal to work, rest and play. Look for hotels with large grounds so you can walk your animal and know your rights \u2014 it is illegal for anyone in the UK to turn away someone with a guide dog, whether that be when entering a taxi or going to a restaurant.\n12. Take an extension lead\nA multi-plug extension lead will become your best friend on holiday; if you\u2019ve got an electric wheelchair to charge and other pieces of equipment that require electricity then the one plug socket that\u2019s not by the bed isn\u2019t going to help. Take an extension lead so you can plug your equipment into multiple holes and have the power connected right next to where you need it.\nSee our pick of the best hotels with accessible rooms\nWhile you\u2019re there\n13. Pace yourself\nIt can be tempting to take part in a tonne of activities, visit all the museums and galleries and spend the night working your way through the cocktail menu but it\u2019s important to remember to pace yourself to keep your health in its best shape for as long as possible.\n14. Embrace train and airport lounges\nOn Eurostar, for example, all disabled people can use the business lounge whether you\u2019re travelling business class or not. I like to use this time to familiarise myself with my itinerary, as well as enjoy the perks such as free snacks, wine and beer.\n15. Use your blue badge\nWe may not be in the EU anymore but your blue badge for parking that you use in the UK is still valid across the EU. Outside of the EU, different rules apply so make sure to check the country\u2019s driving and parking rules ahead of time to avoid a potential fine.\n16. Check foreign public transport\nNot all transport abroad will be as equipped for disabled people as what we\u2019re used to in the UK. Check to see if you need to book assistance or make any other amendments.\nWhere can I travel without a vaccine?"}, {"title": "Air Travel Accessibility", "article": "IATA Positions on Passenger Accessibility\n> Fact sheet: Air Transport Accessibility (pdf)\nNeed for harmonization of disability legislation\nWe recognize we can and should do more. One area of concern is the proliferation of differing disability legislation across the globe, which creates confusion for passengers with disabilities, difficulties for airlines, and raises potential safety implications. Critically, there is no common definition of a passenger with disabilities or agreement on the minimum service levels they can expect when traveling by air.\nIATA advocates for a joint government and industry approach, that meets the needs of passengers with disabilities, while ensuring efficient and safe air transport. In particular, working with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), IATA is campaigning with states to closely involve the airline industry in the inclusion of the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities (UN CRPD) into national aviation legislation and policies related to accessible air transport.\nOne person one fare\nOne person one fare (1P1F) refers to the proposal that a disabled traveler or persons who are disabled by reason of their obesity and who is required to use extra seats, either for an accompanying carer or because they cannot fit in a single seat, be only charged the price of a single seat.\nIn the case of an accompanying carer, that person would effectively travel free of charge. At present this is not a legal requirement anywhere except on some domestic routes in Canada, although airlines in some countries have been \u201crecommended\u201d to offer this service.\nThe issue is a complicated one. A unanimous resolution at IATA\u2019s 75th AGM in 2019 committed IATA members to ensure \u2018Passengers with disabilities have access to safe, reliable and dignified travel\u2019, and the industry is working hard with representatives of the disabilities community to improve travel for passengers with disabilities.\nHowever, the industry does not support the 1P1F principle on several grounds:\nThe finances of an air route are often precarious. The average airline profit per passenger in 2023 was $2.25. This can equate to around 3-4 seats in total on a flight. If these seats are given away for free, then the financial viability of an entire flight could be threatened. The circumstances under which a disabled or obese traveler would require two seats are not easily defined and could be open to abuse. A lack of single global definition would create an unworkable minefield of unharmonized requirements which would confuse airlines and passengers alike. Under the UN Convention there are longstanding definitions of proportionality and the reasonable steps that should be taken to ensure people with disabilities have equal access. This is why, for example, not all legacy metro stations in key cities have step-free access \u2013 the cost of retrofitting them all is disproportionately large. The same principle would hold for giving away free seats to disabled or obese passengers on aircraft.\nAirlines remain committed to working with regulators and travelers with disabilities for proportionate and workable solutions to the various challenges of ensuring fair and equal access to air travel.\nIATA position on face-covering for passengers with disabilities\nSome passengers including those with no autonomy to put/remove a face mask, small children and those with certain medical conditions may not be able to use masks for a lengthy period. Some governments have published regulations on face mask exemption. Find more on the IATA position paper on face-covering for passengers with disabilities (pdf)."}, {"title": "Travelling with mobility and medical equipment", "article": "If you use an electric mobility aid such as an electric wheelchair or scooter, you will need to give the airline some information in advance about the equipment, including its make and model. This is to ensure that it is loaded and stowed safely during the flight and is not a fire risk.\nCheck before you book if the airline has restrictions relating to equipment - these can vary depending on who you fly with.\nBefore travelling you should:\ntell your airline the make, model, weight and size of your wheelchair.\ntake the operating manual with you - this might be useful for the airline.\nlet your airline know if your wheel chair is collapsible and provide details of how to assemble and disassemble it.\nThis will help if there are any issues with loading your equipment into the hold.\nIn partnership with the Queen Elizabeth's foundation for Disabled People awe have produced a film that gives wheelchair users, especially powered wheelchair users information and insight about travelling by air and the support available.\nHow much mobility equipment can I take?\nYou may carry up to two mobility items free of charge. This applies generally for your trip rather than just the flight, so if there is something specific that you will need at your destination the airline should accept it as one of the two pieces of mobility equipment (provided that it is a reasonable request).\nMedical equipment\nYou can travel with medical equipment and supplies provided that the amounts are reasonable.\nMany airlines will want to see a medical certificate if you are taking large quantities of medication.\nYou must have a certificate if you are taking more than 100ml of medicine in liquid or gel form through security.\nProtecting your belongings\nAirlines are liable for any damage to mobility equipment. However, the amount of compensation may be limited to around \u00a31,300 so you may want to take out extra insurance.\nIf your equipment is damaged, the airport is responsible for providing a temporary alternative while yours is repaired or replaced, but this does not have to be on a like for like basis."}, {"title": "Why Accessibility is Essential for Air Travel", "article": "Making air travel accessible to older travelers and people with disabilities is ultimately about being inclusive. It is about enabling everyone to enjoy the freedom that air travel offers. Approximately one in five people in the United States, or 64 million, have a disability and more than 10% of the population in the EU suffer from reduced mobility \u2013 mainly the disabled and the elderly.\nThe world\u2019s population is aging as virtually every country in the world is experiencing growth in the number and proportion of older persons in their population. As a result, IATA and its member airlines are committed to ensuring that all passengers can enjoy the freedom offered by air travel, no matter their abilities or limitations. This is not only the right thing to do for our passengers, it is also good for business. Passengers with disabilities will represent a growing segment. For instance, the total number of wheelchair requests in 2017 was approximately 15 million, a 30% increase on 2016.\nWhy is providing better access to individuals with disabilities important for the air transport industry?\nSafe and dignified travel for all passengers, including those with disabilities, is an airline commitment in addition, for the air transport industry it's not just because it is \"the right thing to do\" it also makes business sense.\nIATA member airlines have an inherent motivation to ensure that all people with accessibility needs have a positive experience when traveling by air. These people are customers-and are a growing segment of the population. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that more than one billion people live with some form of disability, which constitutes approximately 15% of the world's population.\nAirlines commit to improve travel for passengers with disabilities\nTherefore in 2019, the IATA Annual General Meeting (AGM) unanimously adopted a landmark industry resolution which re-affirmed the commitment of IATA member airlines to provide safe, reliable and dignified travel for people with disabilities. At the center of IATA's developement of its guiding principles and all its work on accessibility since, is the disability community's own guiding principle of \"Nothing For Us, Without Us.\" At every stage of the development of airline accessibility policy and operating standards, the disability community is involved and listened to. This is of course the only way to keep the focus on disability, accessibility and inclusion-particularly when facing a new reality and new measures due to a pandemic.\nChanging the focus from disability to accessibility and inclusion is allowing the travel sector to bring together passengers with disabilities and governments. Harmonizing regulations and processes and providing the clarity and global consistency that passengers expect.\nInterview with Linda Ristagno, IATA's AD External Affairs on Air Transport Accessibility\nAirlines launch global action group to improve handling of disability mobility aids\nIn July 2021, IATA announced the launch of a global Mobility Aids Action Group to examine and improve the transport journey of mobility aids, including wheelchairs, with the objective of improving the handling of this vital equipment for travelers with disabilities.\nThe Action Group is the first of its kind aimed at tackling issues around the safe and secure transport of mobility aids\u2014an issue of huge importance to a growing number of travelers. It also provides advice and recommendations to airlines and other stakeholders concerning the establishment of policy, process and standards related to the handling and transport of mobility aids.\nUniquely, the Mobility Aids Action Group involves the full range of stakeholders impacted by this issue, including accessibility organizations (representing travelers with disabilities), airlines, ground service providers, airports and mobility aids manufacturers. It is the first time a mobility aids manufacturer will be invited to participate in an IATA task force. \u201cAs airlines are just one link in the chain in the handling of mobility aids, it is essential we bring all players together to develop solutions. What\u2019s more, we are excited to invite a mobility aids manufacturer to the table. We think this is critical so all stakeholders can work together to take steps to improve the transport journey of mobility aids,\u201d said Willie Walsh, Director General of IATA.\nWheelchair damage or loss during air transportation\nWhile the industry has had standards for persons traveling with disabilities for some time there are still gaps. Damage to mobility aids has been an area that has been identified as a key topic to address from the disability community.\nAirlines have made efforts to improve, but damage or loss is still occurring. And when it does, it is highly distressing to the passenger as these devices are more than equipment\u2014they are extensions of their body and essential to their independence.\nTravelers with mobility aids face risks to their health and safety if their wheelchair or mobility equipment is lost, damaged or destroyed, as replacements are not always provided, and if provided, are not always suitable for the person\u2019s needs.\nThe loss or damage of wheelchairs or other mobility equipment takes away the independence of the traveler and affects every aspect of their daily lives until the matter is resolved appropriately.\nA recent survey from Able Move identified that among those who actively continue to fly, 55% say the biggest single cause of concern when flying was the fear of their wheelchair being damaged or lost.\n\u201cEvery year, thousands of wheelchairs are transported safely by air. However, damage or loss is still occurring. And when it does, it is devastating to the passenger as these devices are more than equipment\u2014they are extensions of their body and essential to their independence. We acknowledge that we are not where we want to be on this as an industry. This is why we want to do something about it on a global level, not through setting up a talking shop, but by bringing the key groups together to take practical action,\u201d said Willie Walsh, Director General of IATA.\nImproved access for passengers with disabilities in the industry restart\nAs airlines rebuild, the industry is eager to build a more inclusive restart. Despite the COVID-19 crisis, the IATA and its member airlines have worked with the accessibility community to move the priority of accessible air travel forward through a number of efforts. These are includeded in the latest Airport Handling Manual (AHM).\nWhat to consider for passengers' with disabilities air travel journey\nTo the extent possible, airline and other stakeholders should strive to ensure that passengers with disabilities maintain their independence and dignity. This is accomplished through adequate airport infrastructure, appropriate training, timely and customer-oriented services, as well as making use of technological solutions that can be leveraged to provided passengers with disabilities with choice and freedom to travel on their own terms. You can find detailed guidelines which can help your operations in section 176 of the AHM.\nPre-Travel: Passenger information, booking and ticketing\nCommunicating assistance needs in advance of travel is recommended and, in some cases, required to fulfill specialized requests. This allows airlines, airports and third-party service providers to be better prepared to assist passengers with disabilities throughout their travel itinerary, making the journey easier and the travel experience more seamless and enjoyable.\nAt the airport\nThe sole responsibility to provide assistance to passengers with disabilities throughout the airport is not limited to the airlines; depending on national regulations, airports may be responsible for providing assistance to passengers with disabilities directly, or via third-party service providers.\nAs not all passenger processes at an airport fall under the airlines\u2019 responsibility (i.e. security screening, exit immigration, customs, etc.) airlines need to work collaboratively with airports, regulators and other stakeholders in order to provide a safe and satisfying travel experience to all passengers.\nCheck-in\nAll available check-in methods such as via airline websites, mobile apps, self-service kiosks should be accessible to passengers with disabilities. In addition, airline agents involved in the check-in process should be trained to ensure that adequate assistance is provided. Passengers with disabilities should also always be offered assistance with carry-on and checked baggage.\nMobility device handling\nThe safe transport of a passenger\u2019s with disability personal mobility device is a critical operation for any airline as the wheelchair or scooter is an extension of the passenger and should be treated as such. Other mobility aids such as walkers and canes provide passengers struggling with mobility much-needed stability and support to safely walk and should also be handled with great care. As general guidance, the transportation of passenger battery-powered devices must be compliant with DGR subsection 2.3.\nBoarding and disembarking\nBoarding the aircraft can be a stressful experience for passengers with disabilities. Airlines should ensure that any requests made in advance are properly noted and any last-minute requests are handled efficiently and with care. Assistance must be provided as necessary, in addition airlines and airports should coordinate to make available at all stations wheelchairs and other mobility devices for boarding/disembarking within airport facilities, before departure, during intermediate stops and on arrival. Upon arrival, airlines should make best efforts to accommodate the passengers with disabilities, procedures will vary by terminal and gate configuration in terms of boarding bridge, etc. Therefore, all staff should be properly trained to provide: adequate mobility transfer techniques and prompt delivery of mobility devices. More details can be found in the Airport Handling Manual (AHM).\nWhat are the benefits of following the IATA guidance found in the AHM?\nPutting into practice the IATA guidance, airlines, airports and other industry stakeholders will:\nEfficiently serve passengers with disabilities by using IATA standards and best practices\nEfficiently communicate with passengers with disabilities before and during their travel experience\nEnsure available measures are applied consistently\nIdentify good practices in passenger assistance during disruptions and irregular operations\nHow can I get the Airport Handling Manual (AHM)?\nYou can order the latest edition of the AHM here."}]
