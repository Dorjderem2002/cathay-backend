While Kerper sometimes relies on her own experiences as a traveler in a wheelchair, she says every trip needs to be tailored to an individual client\u2019s needs. To do so, the team spends time getting to know their clients to match them with the best vacation choice, and visits hotels and tourist spots for inspection, takes cruises beforehand, and collects information from trustworthy sources to ensure a safe, accessible, and fun experience.\nPlanet Abled\nNeha Arora\u2019s Planet Abled arranges customized tours for people with different types of disabilities, and also plans group tours that include non-disabled people. Their trips mostly take place in India and South East Asia, with plans to expand to countries in Europe, and popular activities include river rafting, skiing, trekking, and wildlife safaris. Some of their extra touches include assigning a travel buddy for the blind, seeking special permission from museums so clients can touch and feel the articles on display, and arranging for sign language interpreters for the hearing impaired.\nWheel the World\nAlvaro Silberstein, the CEO of Wheel the World, was paralyzed from the chest down after surviving an accident at 18.

Silberstein wants to create more awareness around accessibility, and his company pays special attention to details like the height of beds, width of doors, and accessibility of bathrooms, compiling this information on the Wheel the World website. Their multi-day trips are designed with local tour operators with a focus on accessible travel, and includes access to adaptive bikes, beach wheelchairs, and equipment for hiking, skydiving, kayaking, scuba diving, and surfing\u2014they\u2019ve even planned Macchu Pichu trips for wheelchair users.

Their network also includes adaptive sports instructors, sailboat skippers, tribal elders, massage therapists, and hot air balloon operators, all of whom are trained to work with travelers with disabilities."}, {"title": "So, What Is Accessible Travel?", "article": "Accessible travel means travel with a disability, right? Well, yes and no\u2026\nThere\u2019s been a lot of talk about \u201caccessible travel\u201d lately \u2013 especially since the UNWTO designated World Tourism Day to Tourism for All in 2016. But what exactly is it, and why is it so important?\nThe easy answer is that a billion people (that\u2019s 15% of the world\u2019s population), lives with some sort of disability, and ensuring equal access to travel is simply the right thing to do. In fact, the first human rights treaty of the 21st century was the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and Article 30 specifically calls for States Parties to ensure that people with disabilities enjoy the benefits of tourism \u2013 which will be all too familiar to any reader of this article.\nBut accessibility is so much more than \u201cmerely\u201d a human rights issue. In fact, tourism professionals are increasingly realising that it offers an economic opportunity by tapping into a market that is neither niche nor small. It\u2019s a misconception that people with a disability don\u2019t travel. We do. Our travel aspirations are very similar to the general population and, although it\u2019s true that the unemployment rate for people with a disability is higher than that for the general population, many of us have jobs and disposable income. South African Tourism\u2019s powerful commercial, featuring a blind tourist, shows how a disabled traveller is actually no different from any other traveller.\nA number of studies, in particular one by VisitEngland, have shown that the value of the so-called Purple Pound is already large and, importantly, that it\u2019s growing as a proportion of the overall tourism spend. A recent study for Tourism Australia found that the accessible travel market is already larger than the much-vaunted Chinese inbound market and is growing more quickly! What these studies have also underlined is the \u201cmultiplier effect\u201d: people, especially those with a disability, don\u2019t travel alone. For example, I travel with my wife and three children, so if a venue isn\u2019t accessible for me as a wheelchair user, it loses the revenue from not one, but five people.\nFIND OUT MORE ABOUT WHAT INTREPID ARE DOING TO MAKE TRAVEL ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYONE HERE\nBut with an ageing population in developed countries, it\u2019s fast becoming a social and economic imperative to provide accessible infrastructure, when already one in five people in the US and Australia are living with disability. Rightly or wrongly, the market driver of this segment is actually not people who identify as disabled, but the 40% of people who retire with an acquired disability \u2013 a figure that rises to 56% at age 70 and 70% at age 80. Currently, this is the retiring Baby Boomer population \u2013 possibly the first generation in human history that won\u2019t be passing on its wealth to its offspring, but instead feels it has earned the right to enjoy a retirement that is lasting longer and longer and, in most cases, involves travel.\nForward-thinking destination management organisations \u2013 such as VisitEngland, Visit Flanders, the German National Tourist Board and Catalonia \u2013 have already invested significant resources into developing tourism experiences and information portals to enable people with access issues to plan their trips more easily. And their marketing strategies \u2013 and, importantly, choice of imagery \u2013 are specifically targeting an ageing demographic. To ensure their business remains sustainable, tourism service providers are also increasingly looking to offer accessible travel experiences to cater to this demographic.\nRELATED: MEET THE FAMILY TRAVELLING THE WORLD WITH THREE KIDS (AND A WHEELCHAIR)\nIn Australia, and much of the world, we use the term \u201caccessible travel\u201d. But by emphasising access (and with most people equating \u201cdisability\u201d with \u201cwheelchair users\u201d), the stress is immediately put on compliance \u2013 the costly business of installing ramps and accessible toilets \u2013 rather than the opportunity to differentiate and capitalise on a large and growing market. In fact, wheelchair users make up less than 10% of the disabled population. People with vision or hearing impairments outnumber wheelchair users, and people with invisible disabilities \u2013 including those living with long-term illness and severe allergies such as coeliac disease \u2013 represent up to 75% of the disabled population. Even when considering people with a mobility impairment, there are up to four times more people who don\u2019t use a wheelchair than do. Think of your parents or grandparents, who might not use a cane, but still need a hand rail when negotiating stairs and really appreciate the occasional bench for a rest when wandering around parks and gardens. So when we talk about this travel \u201csegment\u201d, it would be so much better if we used the term \u201cinclusive travel\u201d to put the emphasis on making sure experiences are able to be enjoyed by the widest possible number of people, instead of making them accessible to a relatively small number of wheelchair users.\nLooking at it this way means there are countless small changes that businesses of all sizes could make that would benefit a wide range of travellers with access needs: assistance dog toileting areas and water bowls; TVs with a captioning option; clear passageways with good colour contrast and signage; large-print black-and-white information materials (ask anyone over 55 about reading fancy menus in dimly lit restaurants\u2026); easy-to-read fonts such as Arial or Helvetica in signage or information materials; hearing loops; telephones that are compatible with hearing aids; vibrating pillow alarms; lowered counters or an occasional table in front of reception to welcome wheelchair-using guests or people of short stature; blocks to adjust the height of beds or tables; making sure cooking and cleaning practices cater for people with food allergies or chemical intolerances\u2026 the list goes on.\nRELATED: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND TRAVEL WITH A HEARING IMPAIRMENT\nAnd let\u2019s not forget the value of a website that\u2019s accessible for people with disabilities, particularly the vision-impaired (Intrepid Travel are working towards having their website accessible to more people \u2013 by aiming for AA Level of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines \u2013 by the end of 2020). Because here\u2019s the thing: the greater one\u2019s access needs, the greater the need for planning using detailed and accurate information. But, ironically, relevant and reliable information regarding accessibility is hard to come by; it\u2019s often either missing or hidden away under FAQs.\nWhat are Intrepid doing to accommodate travellers with disabilities?\nTara Kennaway, who heads up Accessible Travel in Intrepid\u2019s Product team, had this to say. \u201cWe know that travellers with disabilities are increasingly looking beyond specialised disability tour operators and want to travel in an authentic, exploratory way with their family, friends and other like-minded people. We still have plenty of work to do to make our trips more accessible and to be able to share our style of exploring the world with as many people as possible. It\u2019s been fantastic to see the engagement of our staff around the globe in this topic, from our sales teams responding to enquiries from travellers with disabilities, our local operators auditing our trips in country, and our group leaders delivering amazing experiences and customer service to our travellers.\u201d\nIn order to travel independently, trustworthy information is the key and that\u2019s Lonely Planet\u2019s reason for being: to help travellers to get the best out of their trip by providing the information they need to make informed decisions. We have made a modest start by producing access guides to different destinations. Our Accessible Rio de Janeiro guide was supplied to the International Paralympic Committee for visiting athletes; the IPC have already signed up for an Accessible Tokyo guide for the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics. We have exciting plans for this guide as we look to partner with new technology partner What3Words, an innovative navigational mobile app, to get people with a disability exactly where they need to be.\nSUBSCRIBE TO INTREPID\u2019S NEWSLETTER FOR TRAVEL TIPS, COMPETITIONS, GIVEAWAYS & MORE\nI have also curated the world\u2019s largest collection of online resources for travelling with access needs: Accessible Travel Online Resources, which was recognised by the UNWTO in 2016 as one of a handful of examples of best practice in accessible tourism and is now vastly expanded in the current third edition. Lonely Planet\u2019s Accessible Travel Phrasebook contains some 100 words and phrases to assist disabled travellers to make their needs known in 35 languages.\nLonely Planet also publish online articles by disabled travel bloggers (including yours truly) and regularly share and promote the cause to our huge social media following, leveraging our authority in a positive way, in the hope that this will create a knock-on effect. Judging by a recent survey of followers, in which 43% told us they want it to hear more about accessible travel, it looks as though we\u2019re on the right track.\nIntrepid is committed to making travel widely accessible, regardless of ability or disability.

These recommendations aim to guide the decision-makers of natural resources in tourism in undertaking accessibility improvements. The document has a particular focus on facilitating access to protected areas, beaches and parks. The WCPA Tourism and Protected Areas Specialist Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT), acted as the expert reviewers. Their involvement was key in identifying the best actions geared towards a greater extent of accessibility and inclusiveness within nature areas, vis a vis tourism. The guidance tool, whose drafting was led by UNWTO, the ONCE Foundation and UNE, is part of the promotion of ISO Standard 21902:2021. Download here the guidelines in English and Spanish.\nRecommendations for cultural tourism key players on accessibility UNWTO, Fundaci\u00f3n ONCE and UNE issued in September 2023, a set of guidelines targeting key players of the cultural tourism ecosystem, who wish to make their offerings more accessible.\nThe key partners in the drafting and expert review process were the ICOMOS International Cultural Tourism Committee and the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT). The ICOMOS experts\u2019 input was key in covering crucial action areas where accessibility needs to be put in the spotlight, in order to make cultural experiences more inclusive for all people.\nThis guidance tool is also framed within the promotion of the ISO Standard ISO 21902, in whose development UNWTO had one of the leading roles. Download here the English and Spanish version of the Recommendations.\nNew user-friendly guides for destinations to implement accessibility standards On the occasion of the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, UNWTO, ONCE Foundation and the Spanish Association for Standardization have launched, in December 2022, a user-guide targeting public administrations and tourism destinations to implement ISO Standard 21902:2021. This is a key tool to understand specific actions that can be undertaken by a wide range of organizations entrusted with designing policies, strategies and destination marketing plans in the sphere of accessible tourism.

The ATD is an annual UNWTO distinction based on an Expert Committee evaluation, which acknowledges destinations enabling a seamless experience to any tourist, regardless of their abilities. The first ATD was awarded in 2019 and has been temporarily put on hold, given the pandemic.\nVideo \"Change your destination\" The video \u201cChange your destination\u201d was issued by Fundaci\u00f3n ONCE and UNWTO by the occasion of the 2019 International Fair of Tourism (FITUR). Facilitating travel for people with disabilities is an exceptional business opportunity. Yet, a change in mind-set and in the model of tourism services provision is needed in order to meet this major market demand. Accessible environments and services contribute to improve the quality of the tourism product and can create more job opportunities for people with disabilities. Accessibility, therefore, must be an intrinsic part of any responsible and sustainable tourism policy and strategy.\nWorld Tourism Day 2016: \"Tourism for All - promoting universal accessibility\" To mark the celebration of the World Tourism Day 2016 under the theme \"Tourism for All - promoting universal accessibility\" UNWTO, the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT) and the Spanish ONCE Foundation for the Social Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities have produced a compilation of Good Practices in the Accessible Tourism Supply Chain. While these examples provide a small sample of possible solutions regarding accessibility, they will hopefully inspire others to take steps towards broadening the availability of accessible offers in tourism destinations around the world.

Ensuring that the information is accessible, is without any doubt a key to communicating successfully with visitors in all stages of their journey, particularly with regards to travelers with disabilities and special needs. The UNWTO Recommendations on Accessible Information in Tourism have been developed with the support and collaboration of the ONCE Foundation for Cooperation and Social Inclusion of People with Disabilities and the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT).

Consider these spots for your future travel plans.\nHow KAYAK.com can help you find accessible accommodations\nKAYAK.com's search features can help travelers with disabilities find accommodations that meet their needs. To find accessible hotels, first search for hotels in your destination, and then check the \u201cIncreased accessibility\u201d box in the \u201cAmenities\u201d filters on the left-hand side of the page. This filter reveals properties that offer these features: wheelchair accessible, facilities for disabled guests, in-room accessibility, accessible rooms, facilities for disabled guests, and disabled access.\nPlaya del Carmen, Mexico\nOne hour from Canc\u00fan International Airport, Playa Del Carmen is a far cry from its more revelrous neighbor, yet still has accessible hotels and an accessible beach furnished with beach wheelchairs. There\u2019s even adaptive equipment to allow you to go snorkeling to enjoy the coral reef and green turtles. But the main reason for coming here is to visit the nearby and largely wheelchair-accessible Mayan archaeological sites, Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 and Tulum, a rare chance for the mobility-impaired to get up close to ancient ruins.\nSan Diego skyline from the harbor \u00a9 David Toussaint / Getty Images\nSan Diego, California, USA\nWith the Americans with Disabilities Act having just celebrated its 30th anniversary, much of the USA\u2019s infrastructure is accessible, but our pick is San Diego. Laid out along the classic grid system, generally flat and with a fully accessible trolley system, it also boasts a balmy year-round 64-80\u00b0F climate.\nThe historic Gaslamp Quarter is very wheelchair friendly, as is the massive Balboa Park (incorporating the slightly hilly San Diego Zoo), but it\u2019s the miles of beachfront promenade with beach wheelchairs available \u2013 including a motorized one with caterpillar tracks at Mission Beach! \u2013 that are the main attraction.\nBarcelona, Spain\nWith the national tourism authority and Catalonia in particular pushing accessible travel, it\u2019s no surprise that wheelchair users have been flocking to Barcelona. With 80% of the metro stations and 100% of buses wheelchair-accessible, as well as a relatively flat and cobblestone-free old city, getting around is a breeze.\nWhat\u2019s more, wheelchair users not only jump to the front of the queue for attractions such as the breathtaking Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, they often get in for free! You can explore the length of La Rambla and get around the famous Mercat de la Boqueria; even the beach has wheelchair access and people on hand to help.\nWelcome to Las Vegas \u00a9 Michael Phillips / Getty Images\nLas Vegas, Nevada, USA\nLas Vegas is undoubtedly one of the most accessible cities for people with disabilities in the US. Of course, the casinos and the venues hosting world-renowned musicians and shows are all wheelchair accessible, as are the vast majority of sites and attractions, many of which \u2013 like the Fountains of Bellagio and the Fremont Street Experience \u2013 are completely free.\nMore surprising, perhaps, the High Roller \u2013 the tallest observation wheel in the world, which takes 30 minutes to do a full revolution \u2013 is also wheelchair-accessible. And if you\u2019re after an adrenaline rush, wheelchair users can even enjoy the SlotZilla Zip Line and the Zoomline, which reach speeds of up to 35 miles an hour, or a hot-air balloon ride over the city.\nAdd to this a very wide choice in accessible accommodation, easy exploration along the wide sidewalks of the Strip, a fully accessible bus service that serves all parts of the city, and plenty of wheelchair-accessible taxis and you can begin to understand why Las Vegas has become something of a destination for wheelchair users.\nManchester, UK\nAlthough it was the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, much of central Manchester was rebuilt in the late 1990s, making smooth, wide, step-free pavements, as well as stepless entry into shops, restaurants and bars the norm \u2013 ideal for anyone with mobility requirements.\nNorthern England\u2019s cultural hub is well served by accessible public transport, leaving you free to pay homage at Old Trafford, learn about our industrial roots at the Museum of Science and Industry or shop with the goths at Affleck\u2019s. And if you\u2019ve had enough of the city, the Peak District National Park, with well-developed facilities for visitors with disabilities, is less than an hour away.\nA piazza in Taormina, Sicily \u00a9 Matt Munro / Lonely Planet\nSicily, Italy\nItaly might not spring to mind as a very accessible destination due to its narrow, often cobblestone streets. But there are a number of tour operators that cater to travelers with disabilities. Motor-impaired travelers can enjoy scuba diving, 4WD off-road driving, traditional Sicilian fishing and olive oil making \u2013 not to mention the gastronomic delights normally associated with Italy. Indeed, two Guinness world records have been set here: first paraplegic to dive to 59m and first blind woman to dive to 41m!\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania, USA\nAs one of the oldest cities in the US, you might not expect Philadelphia to be very accessible \u2013 but it is! While the Old Town may offer some challenges for wheelchair users, sidewalks are generally well maintained in the more touristed areas, with plenty of curb cuts and tactile markings.\nThis is particularly useful for wheelchair users considering most of the city\u2019s attractions are within a two-mile radius of the City Hall. The subway, opened in 1907, is only partially wheelchair-accessible, as is the overland rail network, but unfortunately the aging trolley system is not. However, the city\u2019s fleet of more than 1000 buses are all low-floor and wheelchair-accessible, as is the PHLASH tourist bus which runs a continuous loop downtown, stopping at many popular attractions, and costs only $5 for an all-day pass.\nNeedless to say, all of the city\u2019s most popular attractions \u2013 including Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell, Love Park and the Philadelphia Museum of Art \u2013 are fully wheelchair-accessible despite their antiquity. And when it comes to finding accommodations, there are plenty of wheelchair-friendly options right in the center of the action.\nSandridge Bridge in Melbourne, Australia \u00a9 Catherine Sutherland / Lonely Planet\nMelbourne, Australia\nWith its highly accessible public transport system and compact city center, Melbourne is one of the most accessible cities in the world.

Most of its buses are accessible, but the city is so small, with plenty of ramps and curb cuts, you might rarely need them.\nThe city\u2019s main drawcard, the 16th-century Ljubljana Castle is reached via a funicular (free for people with disabilities and a companion) or train, both wheelchair-accessible. Many of Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik\u2019s famous bridges have recently been made accessible, and were joined in 2010 by the award-winning Butchers\u2019 Bridge, which allows wheelchair users access to boats.\nSingapore has established accessibility requirements into its city code \u00a9 Ninnat Fongsupa / 500px\nSingapore\nSingapore has to be the most accessible city in Asia and one of the most accessible cities in the world. Its universal code on barrier-free accessibility, in place for decades, plus increasing affluence have resulted in an infrastructure with stepless access to most buildings and no shortage of curb cuts.\nAlthough power wheelchair-friendly taxis aren\u2019t common, the accessibility of the mass rail transit (MRT) and buses makes them unnecessary. In Singapore, the question is not \u201cwhat is accessible?\u201d but rather \u201cwhat isn\u2019t?\u201d \u2013 from its street food hawker centers to its marvelous zoo.\nVienna, Austria\nLike many European cities, Vienna is steeped in history, being the center of the former Habsburg Empire and the musical heart of Europe. Unlike many of its counterparts, however, its cobblestones have been removed, as have many of the curbs.\nThe refurbished city is both flat and compact, with most central shops and cafes fully accessible. Getting around is relatively easy with elevators to the metro and plenty of low-floor trams. Most museums and places of interest are fully accessible, including the must-see Schloss Sch\u00f6nbrunn.\nYou might also like:\nTake a spin around the globe with an accessible travel expert\nWhat I have learned from travelling the world with a wheelchair"}, {"title": null, "article": null}, {"title": null, "article": null}, {"title": "Planning an accessible trip?

Guests of Jade Mountain, a widely cherished hotel on St. Lucia's southwest coast, will have uninterrupted views of them right outside their elegant abodes called \u2018sanctuaries.\u2019 These lush lodgings have 15-foot-high ceilings, and elaborate infinity pools (between 450 and 900 square feet), and thanks to eco-pioneer Nick Troubetzkoy\u2019s visions, the biophilic design beautifully blurs the lines between the well-kitted indoors, and the Piton-silhouetted outdoors. Jade Mountain\u2019s sanctuaries deliberately eschew the confines of windows and a fourth wall; perfect for looking out at the multi-hued layer cake that is St. Lucia at sunset.\nNot content with having sumptuous hilltop views, Jade Mountain is also heaven for chocolate lovers.

Now that restrictions are largely a thing of the past and travelers are free to move about the world, people are once again turning to travel for inspiration, relaxation, and the opportunity to experience something new.\nIt goes without saying that those opportunities should be available to everyone, regardless of race, gender identity, or sexual orientation.\u00c2\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been in the travel industry for more than 15 years\u00e2\u0080\u0094some might even say I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m an expert in the field. As a cisgender heterosexual white male, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m acutely aware that I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t experienced the hurdles or prejudices others have when traveling to certain destinations.\nHowever, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen first-hand how travel connects people and bridges divides, and I want that experience for others. As a leader in the travel industry, I feel like it is my duty to ensure that everyone has a good experience, and that means helping every traveler feel safe and welcome on every trip.\nWorking with destination marketing organizations, I have learned how destinations can create safe, welcoming, and inclusive spaces for diverse travelers. Here are some ways destination marketers can support that vision.\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nIntegrate values that match up with the needs of diverse travelers.\u00c2\nJust like with other products, travelers are \u00e2\u0080\u009cshopping their values.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They want inclusive, accessible destinations where they know they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll feel safe and welcomed. According to a recent survey from Accenture, approximately three out of every five travelers want their travel providers to share similar diversity and inclusion values.\nWhen LGBTQ+ and ethnic minorities responded, that number increased to nearly three out of every four travelers. In today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s market, travelers are no longer willing to compromise their beliefs, which means destinations must prioritize diversity and inclusion to create the right reputation and win travel bookings.\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nEnsure authenticity for your destination through collaboration and accessibility.\u00c2\nDiversity and inclusion go well beyond marketing; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a way of life and a belief system that requires destination marketers to think about the messaging they're putting out and what kind of destination they want to be. You must become advocates for both your destination and the travelers you want to attract, and advocacy isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just about race or gender.\nIt also includes abilities, such as making places wheelchair accessible or safe for those with autism, and meeting the diverse needs of all travelers. Above all, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to be authentic. This level of grit, sweat, and passion goes way beyond a hollow tagline. Travelers will see through any attempts to woo them without substance.\u00c2\nOne of the best ways to be authentic is to have open-minded conversations and learn from travelers who are looking for inclusive destinations. Rather than making assumptions or boxing in travelers, speak directly to Black, Latino, Asian and LBGTQ+ travelers to find out what they really want and embrace who they are. Travelers everywhere want the same thing\u00e2\u0080\u0094to feel included, safe, and able to explore without prejudice.\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nConnect with travelers along their journey throughout your destination.\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the best way for you to put your best, most inclusive foot forward? First, learn which travelers are coming to your destination. You likely have diverse travelers visiting your destination, so find out who they are and what they want and find ways to accommodate and inspire them.\nFor example, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re attracting LGBTQ+ travelers, you could put on more LGBTQ+-friendly events, which will naturally encourage travelers to return and attract new travelers. The best way to do this is to band together. Embracing diversity is a collective effort, so work with hotels, restaurants, and attractions in your destination to ensure travelers will have the same inclusive experience wherever they go.\nIn addition to knowing your travelers and working together, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to have the right toolkit. For example, Destinations International is creating diversity and inclusion toolkits for destinations. Your website is the face of your destination and a huge part of your toolkit, so periodically review your content. Do you use inclusive language? Would a traveler feel safe and comfortable when visiting?\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nDestinations leading the charge in making travel accessible for all.\nA number of destinations are working diligently to ensure travelers from all backgrounds feel safe and accepted. New York City\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website is rich with options for all travelers, ranging from The Black Experience to halal-friendly options and AAPI leaders.\nBoston recently launched its All Inclusive campaign, offering insights into Boston\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cultural diversity and helping travelers understand their options for accessibility around the city.\nThis year, Cleveland celebrated Freedom Fest in honor of Juneteenth, while Baltimore continues to celebrate its diverse population. Regardless of the destination, there are so many incredible ways to showcase diverse populations and traditions while welcoming travelers from all backgrounds.\u00c2\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nEnsuring inclusive and accessible environments into the future.\nI am proud to be part of an industry that connects human beings and helps us realize we are all the same. Travel is the best weapon to break down ignorance and judgment barriers. It is inspirational to witness destination marketers leading the charge to promote diversity and inclusion and make travel accessible to all people.\nBy creating inclusive, safe environments, DMOs are positioned to lead the charge in making sure travelers can explore the world in which we live.\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d"}, {"title": "New Inclusive Travel Insights Report: Why Welcoming All Travelers Matters", "article": "Travel\u2014by its very nature\u2014promotes a greater understanding of people from different walks of life. Yet while the travel industry has made some strides toward becoming more inclusive, diverse, and accessible, there\u2019s still work to be done.\nExpedia Group\u2019s mission is to power global travel for everyone, everywhere. To help realize this vision, we started by looking inward to ensure that we are reflecting the diversity of our travelers and modeling the inclusive mindsets that make travel a force for good. We understand the importance of not only practicing inclusion, but also empowering our partners to do the same.\nThat\u2019s why we commissioned custom research to understand how consumers feel about inclusive travel, and how they believe the current travel landscape stacks up. Conducted with Wakefield Research, the study surveyed 11,000 representative consumers in 11 countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, the UK, and the U.S. Our findings are included in a new Inclusive Travel Insights Report to help your brand practice inclusion better, promote diversity, and provide equal access to all travelers. Below is a snapshot of the report.\nAccessibility and diversity in travel\nOne aspect of inclusion is ensuring equal access to all travelers. This is especially important as Baby Boomers are expected to be a growing traveler segment while also experiencing age-related health issues. Our research shows that 54% of this generation finds accessibility in travel is very important, 5% more than the general population.\nAs for diversity, our research shows that 7 in 10 consumers would choose a destination, lodging, or transportation option that is more inclusive to all types of travelers, even if it\u2019s more expensive. This means they are willing to spend more on travel that\u2019s truly inclusive.\nHotel advertising that can reach any traveler, anywhere Travelers looking to book a hotel use multiple channels to find their ideal place to stay, from social media to travel websites, and more. This is why it\u2019s imperative that you know when \u2014 and where \u2014 to reach the right traveler. Whether you\u2019re trying to reach early-bird or last-minute bookers, our targeting capabilities can help you connect with the right traveler at the right time. Connect with your target audience\nLocal culture and community in travel\nIt\u2019s also important for the travel industry to be inclusive of local cultures and communities, and for travelers to pay attention to their interactions with them. Indeed, our research shows that over 1 in 3 consumers are looking for information on ways to engage, recommendations for supporting indigenous cultures, and ways to spend time volunteering while traveling.\nIn fact, 74% would choose a travel option that supports local cultures and communities, even if it was more expensive.\nRepresentation in travel marketing\nClearly travel marketers have an opportunity to do better, to help all travelers and destination communities feel represented. This is important not only because it\u2019s the right thing to do, but also because it\u2019s better for business.\nAccording to our research, 78% of survey respondents said they have made a travel choice based on promotions or ads they felt represented them through messaging or visuals. For Millennials that figure is even higher \u2013 84% have made a travel choice based on representation in travel advertising.\nExamples of inclusive travel marketing campaigns\nSo what does representation in marketing look like? Here are a couple examples of partners that worked with us to help share their commitment to inclusion in their travel advertising.\nVisit Panam\u00e1\u2019s \u201cThe Next Turn\u201d Features Blind Adventurer\nOur research shows that 92% of consumers think it\u2019s important for travel providers to meet the accessibility needs of all travelers. But travel shoppers may not know if a destination they are considering can accommodate them.\nThat\u2019s why Visit Panam\u00e1 partnered with Expedia Group Media Solutions and our award-winning creative team on a new video series called \u201cThe Next Turn\u201d to promote the destination. One episode features Amar, a blind traveler, who experiences a rainforest, volcano hike, and coffee farm in Panam\u00e1 through his sense of hearing, smell, taste, and touch. This campaign showcases how travelers with different abilities can immerse themselves in the amazing experiences Panam\u00e1 offers.\nTourism Malaysia Promotes Local Culture\nAnother way to practice inclusion is to respect local cultures and help improve the livelihoods of host communities.\nTourism Malaysia knows this, which is why it worked with us to create a Travel Spotlight landing page. The Spotlight shows travelers how they can experience Malaysian culture by visiting historical sites such as Georgetown, Penang, a UNESCO World Heritage site and home to one of the largest collections of pre-war buildings in Southeast Asia; or by observing a different way of life in Sarawak, which has traditional longhouses housing communities of up to 100 families; or by visiting the indigenous communities of Kadazan and Dusuns, where visitors can shop an array of traditional handicrafts.\nHow your brand can be more inclusive\nWhen traveler shoppers feel understood and embraced, they\u2019re more likely to book. So how can your brand be more inclusive? First, travel marketers can draw from our Inclusion & Diversity in Travel Advertising guidelines, which documents best practices on delivering marketing campaigns that represent and cater to all people."}, {"title": "Inclusive Travel: The Importance of Getting Tourism Right", "article": "The number of international tourist arrivals surpassed 1.3 billion in 2017, generating an equal $1.3 billion in tourism spending. According to the UNWTO, the gains were led in part by a 9 percent increase in international arrivals in Africa.\nAt a time when so many booming industries are technologies, tourism has become a powerful people-driven economic force, and with that power comes a massive responsibility. In many parts of the world, inequality is widening and wealth increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few. Tourism\u2019s potential for inclusivity presents an opportunity to distribute the economics of a booming global industry more broadly, to communities and people who not only have not benefited from tourism before but may face limited options for building better livelihoods for themselves and their families.\nOur upcoming Africa Travel Summit reminds us of how critically important it is that we get the tourism opportunity right. If done well, the benefits will stay within the communities in which the travel occurs\u2014distinguishing travel from many other industries that have found riches in Africa and exported them elsewhere. For us at Airbnb, the two-day summit will be a chance to hear and learn from some of the continent\u2019s most visionary entrepreneurs in travel and technology. The Summit is part of our $1 million commitment, announced in 2017, to expand tourism in Africa in ways that are local, authentic, sustainable, geographically diverse and yes, demographically inclusive\u2014what we call \u201chealthy tourism.\u201d\nTo help our broader community beyond Africa engage with the Travel Summit, Airbnb will showcase the work of African content creators, highlight African destinations and celebrate African hosts on our global social media channels for the week.\nAlso this month, you can join us in following Jessica Nabongo, who is now nearly 70 percent of the way toward becoming the first black woman to visit all 195 countries and states in the world. A dual citizen of both Uganda and the US, Jessica is using her Ugandan passport as well as her American one in order to raise awareness of outbound African tourism and the mobility gap between US and African passports. We\u2019ll be engaging with Jessica as she travels to Lebanon, Cyprus, Jordan and Beijing.\nBut opportunities to make sure underserved communities can benefit from inclusive travel aren\u2019t exclusive to developing countries\u2014they can be found in the world\u2019s most advanced economies.\nAirbnb\u2019s Srin Madipalli, Suzanne Edwards, and the rest of the team formerly of travel startup Accomable are working with our staff and local governments in the UK and Japan to find ways to expand both hosting and travel opportunities for people with disabilities.\nFor the start of Hispanic Heritage Month on September 15, Airbnb\u2019s own Juntos employee resource group will host a fiesta to celebrate our local employee, vendor, host and guest community and raise awareness of Latinx issues. We\u2019re also sponsoring 25 students as they attend the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute\u2019s Leadership Conference in Washington, DC, a gathering designed to empower young Latinx to take on issues affecting the US Latinx community.\nThis month also brings the second anniversary of Airbnb\u2019s anti-discrimination report, issued on September 8, 2016 as our first step\u2014of what we know will be many\u2014toward eliminating bias wherever possible from our platform. At Airbnb, we are committed to fighting bias through inclusion. Our ability to provide guests with an inclusive travel experience can only start with Airbnb being an inclusive travel company, looking internally and externally for opportunities to champion diversity and rid the platform of potential discrimination. We also believe that inclusiveness is self-perpetuating. As our CEO and Head of Community Brian Chesky often observes, when we travel and experience new surroundings and cultures, we realize people are 99-percent the same.\nAmong the many other initiatives we launched in releasing the report was Instant Book, an opt-in feature for hosts that reduces the potential for bias by allowing any guest to book a listing without securing prior host approval. While we have much more work to do here, I am pleased to report that two years after we launched the feature, Airbnb now offers 3 million listings, 60 percent of our inventory, that are instantly bookable.\nWe also recently took a step toward fulfilling our commitment to diversifying our senior leadership by appointing our first woman board member, Ann Mather, an incredible leader from Pixar and Disney and current board member of both Pixar and Alphabet. Ann joins former American Express Chairman Ken Chenault as our second independent board member. Their expertise and life experience will be vital as Airbnb works toward fulfilling our vision of becoming the world\u2019s first end-to-end\u2014or first truly all-inclusive\u2014travel company."}, {"title": "Inclusive travel is impacting the choices travellers make: Expedia", "article": "New data released by Expedia Group Media Solutions shows that consumers are paying attention to how inclusive current travel offerings are when searching and booking.

New designs take into account the needs of everyone, including the elderly and the disabled. But we also live in a compact and vertical city. The pavements can be narrow and the hills steep. So, there is much work still to be done to enhance accessibility.\nWhen planning new development areas and major public works, we are committed to make them sustainable and accessible to all. For example, accessibility and sustainability are two of the planning principles of the 40-hectare West Kowloon Cultural District, one of the world's largest arts and culture undertakings so far.\nWe also adopt a people-oriented approach when facelifting our world-famous harbourfront, planning new towns, and rejuvenating older districts. More green and open space and barrier-free facilities will be provided. Come back in a few years, I am sure you will see many new and vibrant areas in Hong Kong .\nSustainable development must be inclusive. Everyone should have the opportunity to contribute to sustainable development and benefit from it.\nA truly caring and inclusive society is a measure of sustainable development. One of the yardsticks measuring the level of social inclusion is the connectivity of people and their capacity to get around.\nNo man is an island. Access and transport are priority issues for all, regardless of age and physical ability. It is how people achieve and maintain independence and participate in activities and no one should be left out.\nCross-sectoral collaboration\nThe Government's policy objectives in this respect are enshrined in our 2007 Hong Kong Rehabilitation Programme Plan. The two strategic directions for the development of the rehabilitation service, including accessibility, are, firstly, to promote cross-sectoral collaboration in providing a barrier-free environment.\nThis includes diversified services for people with disabilities so they can fully integrate into the community; and second, to empower people with disabilities to become valuable members of society.\nIn terms of access and transport, our goal is to create an enabling physical environment for persons with disabilities. This involves providing easy access to all buildings and use of public transport.\nThe United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities came into effect in Hong Kong in August 2008. The purpose of the convention is to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all people with disabilities, and to promote respect for their inherent dignity.\nHong Kong is now preparing a report setting out in detail the measures to implement the convention and the resulting progress achieved, including accessible transport and tourism. Our report will form part of our nation's overall report.\nAccessible transport\nOne of our objectives is to provide accessible public transport services and infrastructure through the vision of \"Transport for All\". Under this umbrella, a \"5-Betters Strategy\" was formulated. The strategy forms the backbone of our holistic programmes and covers five main elements.\nFirst, better accessible transport services for all. This covers the further expansion of an accessible public transport network and optimising the efficiency of Reha-bus services.\nSecond, better public transport infrastructure and facilities for all. Areas covered include the provision of accessible public transport interchanges, bus terminals, taxi stands, ferry piers and railway stations.\nThird, better streets and pedestrian areas for all. We are providing better pedestrian facilities such as electronic audible devices at pedestrian crossings and tactile guide paths to connect major public transport interchanges and community facilities. We are installing more lifts at footbridges and extending pedestrian areas.\nFourth, better planning standards, guidelines and procedures. This involves updating our Transport Planning & Design Manual and guidelines to meet changing needs and new circumstances.\nBetter partnership\nAnd finally, better partnership for action and results. Here we are developing advisory channels on new initiatives to promote the vision of \"Transport for All\". We are also partnering with local and overseas stakeholders to promote accessibility to transport for people with disabilities.\nEffective partnership is vital in realising our \"Transport for All\" vision. This collaboration involves the Government working hand-in-hand with transport operators, the rehabilitation sector and organisations for people with disabilities.\nThrough the \"5-Betters Strategy\", public transport services and transport facilities have become more user-friendly and accessible to people with disabilities. Railway and franchised bus operators are encouraged to make their vehicles and services accessible as far as practicable.\nApart from special transport services funded by the Government to serve those who are unable to use public transport, we also provide incentives in the form of a profitable operating environment and in setting guidelines and design standards to encourage provision of such facilities.\nPositive approach\nThis positive approach has helped to motivate, energise and enhance our drive towards a more accessible transport system.\nMany of you have travelled long distances to be here. I hope your experience of our airport, transport and hotels as well as here at the Convention and Exhibition Centre has enriched your stay so far. Last year, we received almost 30 million visitors from around the world.\nTourism is a key sector of our economy. We want you to enjoy your stay with us and, when you return home, spread the word that Hong Kong is a diverse, vibrant and accessible holiday destination.\nOver many years, our tourism industry has become highly developed. We are increasingly focused on segmentation as a way to provide better service to specific tourist groups such as families, business people and cultural tours.\nOne rapidly emerging market is \"grey tourism\" for seniors. To encourage more seniors to visit our city, we are embracing the principle of barrier-free tourism.\nBarrier-free tourism\nBarrier-free tourism has been adopted in our major tourist attractions including the Peak, Ocean Park , Hong Kong Disneyland and Hong Kong Wetland Park . We also aim to provide barrier-free tourism to new tourist attractions in future, such as the new cruise terminal.\nWe have put in place measures to facilitate visits by disabled people and the elderly, such as providing wheelchair access, inductive loop systems and tactile guide paths. Staff are trained to provide assistance to visitors with specific needs so that everyone can enjoy the facilities and attractions.\nBarrier-free access is an important feature at all major tourism areas such as shopping malls, restaurants and hotels.\nAs well as modern infrastructure, specific schemes are rolled out by tourism operators to welcome disabled and senior guests. For instance, local seniors can enjoy free entry to Ocean Park . Hong Kong Disneyland has also introduced a new scheme to offer free tickets for disabled persons and their carers.\nOur mass transit railway is now charging nominal price for the elderly two days of the week to facilitate the elderly to travel, meet friends and families and enjoy all sorts of activities all over the territory.\nIn addition, the Hong Kong Tourism Board and the Hong Kong Rehabilitation Society have worked together in creating online platforms. These contain useful tourism information for disabled persons. We believe that barrier-free travel offers a new opportunity for our tourism industry.\nChief Secretary Henry Tang gave these remarks at the opening ceremony of the 12th International Conference on Mobility & Transport for Elderly & Disabled Persons at the Hong Kong Convention & Exhibition Centre."}, {"title": null, "article": null}, {"title": "Barrier-Free Information Website - Hong Kong Federation of Handicapped Youth", "article": "\u2018Barrier-free Travel Guide\u2019 and 'Barrier-free Recreation Guide' introduces over 50 hot tour routes of Hong Kong, namely \u2018sight-seeing line\u2019, \u2018leisure line\u2019, \u2018ecology line\u2019 and \u2018cultural discovery line\u2019.

The special issue explores theoretical approaches, foundations and issues in the study of accessible tourism from a futures perspective. Accessible tourism, as with any area of academic study is an evolving field of academic research and industry practice, set within a dynamic social context. The field is interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary, and is influenced by geography, ageing and disability studies, economics, public policy, psychology, law, architecture, construction sciences, technology and marketing. Past research has attempted to view, explain and unpack the inherent complexities (Darcy, 2010) within accessible tourism through a variety of lenses, including human rights, critical tourism, embodiment, customer segmentation and universal design (UD), to name a few (see Buhalis and Darcy, 2011; Buhalis et al., 2012). The special issue is timely given the operationalisation of the United Nations (2006) Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities by 160 countries. Central to the convention is the right for tourists with disability to access transport and built environment in Article 9 and tourism experiences, goods and services within Article 30. It is therefore pertinent to look at the future of accessible tourism and contemplate a number of issues including (but not limited to) the role of technology in reshaping disability; if and how policy makers and planners are addressing the impact of accessible tourism in a sustainable manner; the political influence of people with disabilities, who make up the largest minority group in the USA, on the future of tourism; the science fiction of exoskeletons and gene therapy as a new form of adventure tourist; and the future state of embodied identity and accessible tourism. The special issue provides the opportunity for contributors to take part in the current discourses on accessible tourism from a futures perspective, in order that we can understand, manage and contribute to the development of accessible tourism in the context of economically, socially and environmentally sustainable communities. Specific topics included conceptual and research papers, viewpoints and trend papers, both qualitative and quantitative, discussing topics relating to the future of accessible tourism. Papers include a range of issues including: inclusive destinations; accessible tourism in Development Planning (toward the UN Sustainable Development Goals 2030); policy-making for accessible tourism; embodiment; representation; law and legislation; architecture and universal design; inclusion/exclusion from experiences; markets and needs analysis; accessible transport; accessible events; accessibility and culture/heritage; accessible accommodation; education/training; and technology and applications. In contrast to the past 30 years, where disability and tourism research has been largely concerned with overcoming barriers that exclude certain people (see Smith, 1987), we can discern the contours of new movements in accessible tourism, whereby overarching principles and standards of sustainability, social responsibility and customer service. The delivery of equitable tourism experiences demand the attention of sector actors and stakeholders. Accessible tourism, in this context, should be seen in the future as much more than a range of supports to excluded target groups, becoming a set of ground rules and codes of practice which contribute to the development of all tourism offers and destinations in an inclusive way. If we should gaze into the crystal ball for a moment, we could envisage that tourism will not be defined primarily in terms of different target groups, since principles of responsibility, sustainability and accessibility will in the future inform the quality criteria to which all destinations should comply and be judged as part of destination competitiveness in increasingly global context. Customers will become more aware of their individual rights and also the need to protect and sustain communities and the natural environment, influencing tourism service providers to follow generally accepted rules of service quality, genuine interactivity and engagement with the local culture, people and resources. The capability of tourism providers to recognise those rights for all (e.g. of tourists with disabilities, Design for All, responsible behaviour, inclusion of the local communities in a transparent system of remuneration and participation, working opportunities for socially excluded group etc.) is going to be the threshold, which determines whether their offers will succeed or fail in the future. The tourism sector will increasingly be seen as having transformational power as \u201ca shaper of society\u201d, acting as a promoter of jobs and economic growth, a participant in regional and community planning and a partner in global development programmes. In addition, tourism should be developed as industry that promotes understanding, inclusion and well-being for all in an equitable way. Businesses, destinations and networks, that are already active in the field of accessible tourism and/or representing markets with different specific requirements will participate more widely in the mainstream, bringing their expertise and knowledge to bear on all those issues that are still seen as \u201cdifferent types of tourism\u201d. In the development of accessible destinations and experiences, the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (2015) will be playing an increasingly supportive role, especially through its Global Code for Ethics in Tourism and the recently published Manuals on Accessible Tourism (2015), produced by ONCE Foundation and the European Network for Accessible Tourism (2015b). Before discussing the papers that have been selected for publication we would like to set the scene by examining some major conceptual and policy development areas that we believe will have a significant influence on accessible tourism futures in the future. These include: dreams and aspirations of people with disability; demography; UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; destination competitiveness frameworks; UD; and the newly adopted UN Sustainable Development Goals for 2030. Each of these areas of influence will now be outlined prior to the papers for the special edition being summarised for their contribution to the future of accessible tourism.\nDefining and conceptualising accessible tourism Conceptualising accessible tourism to reflect all its dimensions and multidisciplinarity is critical for the future. The study of tourism and disability has been a reasonably recent phenomenon with the first detailed examination emerging from the leisure constraints literature (Smith, 1987). From this beginning, a great deal of individual studies are emerged that documented significant issues with demand, supply and coordination of travel for people with disability. More recently the field has started to mature with a conceptualisation that has sought to make sense out of the individual studies and provide an overall framework for understanding the phenomena. To assist with this conceptualisation, Buhalis and Darcy (2011) offer the following definition: Accessible tourism is a form of tourism that involves collaborative processes between stakeholders that enables people with access requirements, including mobility, vision, hearing and cognitive dimensions of access, to function independently and with equity and dignity through the delivery of universally designed tourism products, services and environments. This definition adopts a whole of life approach where people through their lifespan benefit from accessible tourism provision. These include people with permanent and temporary disabilities, seniors, obese, families with young children and those working in safer and more socially sustainably designed environments (adapted from Darcy and Dickson, 2009, p. 34 in Buhalis and Darcy, 2011, pp. 10-11). Importantly the definition recognises collaboration between stakeholders across demand, supply and coordination to recognise that disability is a complex construct involving mobility, vision, hearing, cognitive and other embodiments. The definition recognises that developing inclusive destinations and accessible tourism experiences also benefit other groups in the community. Hence, it contributes toward a greater social sustainability of the industry by including and, hence, providing for a much broader cross-section of consumers that has previously been considered by the industry. In understanding the importance of individuals with disability, the stakeholders they engage with and the influence of UD on the products, services and environments they wish to seek enabling experiences. Buhalis and Darcy (2011) suggests that to develop accessible tourism futures destination managers must strategically plan through the lens of UD. Figure 1 outlines the cyclical strategic approach to engaging UD approaches across disability and lifespan considerations as a foundation for developing future accessible destination experiences.\nDreams and aspirations of people with disability The dreams and aspirations of individuals play a fundamental role in shaping the choices, which lead them to travel. Among people who live with a disability, the idea of leaving behind one\u2019s everyday surroundings and going on a journey can create significant anxiety (Darcy, 1998). People with disability often can design or influence their everyday environment whilst they have routines to negotiate any difficulties and thresholds that exist. This does not apply to new environments whilst travelling, where they do not have prior knowledge, networks or influence on the design nor the potential barriers that are to face and the way to overcome them. Indeed, a recent European survey (GfK, 2015) suggests that up to half of people with disability do not travel on holiday, due to a combination of lack of reliable information, lack of funds and previous bad experiences. Yet, the desire to travel remains with studies showing that it is not a person\u2019s impairment that impedes their travel but a series of interpersonal, attitudinal structural constraints (Daniels et al., 2005; Darcy, 2003). In recognising that a person's impairment does not constrain their travel motivations, the boundaries to what is regarded as accessible tourism destinations and experiences are continually pushed by the accessible explorers who forge new pathways for others to follow.\nMillennium development goals (MDGs) and the UN global compact At the Millennium Summit in September 2000 the largest gathering of world leaders in history adopted the UN Millennium Declaration, committing their nations to a global partnership to reduce extreme poverty and setting a series of targets, with a deadline of 2015. These targets, known as the MDGs are a set of eight specific goals set by the 191 United Nations member countries that have the goal of halving world poverty by the year 2015: Eradicating extreme poverty continues to be one of the main challenges of our time, and is a major concern of the international community. Ending this scourge will require the combined efforts of all, governments, civil society organizations and the private sector, in the context of a stronger and more effective global partnership for development. The Millennium Development Goals set timebound targets, by which progress in reducing income poverty, hunger, disease, lack of adequate shelter and exclusion \u2013 while promoting gender equality, health, education and environmental sustainability \u2013 can be measured. They also embody basic human rights \u2013 the rights of each person on the planet to health, education, shelter and security. The Goals are ambitious but feasible and, together with the comprehensive United Nations development agenda, set the course for the world\u2019s efforts to alleviate extreme poverty by 2015 (United Nations Secretary-General BAN Ki-moon). The aim of the MDGs is to encourage development by improving social and economic conditions in the world\u2019s poorest countries. Since the MDG\u2019s were agreed to significant progress has been made. To date average overall incomes have increased by approximately 21 per cent. The number of people living in extreme poverty declined by an estimated 130 million. Chile mortality rates fell from 103 deaths per 1,000 live births a year to 88. Life expectancy rose from 63 years to 65 years. An additional 8 per cent of the developing world\u2019s people received access to clean water and an additional 15 per cent acquired access to improved sanitation services. In 2015 the UN countries will adopt a new sustainable development agenda and a new global agreement on climate change. The actions taken in 2015 are expected to result in new sustainable development goals that build on the eight MDG\u2019s (United Nations, 2015). Tourism has long been seen as having significant potential to help achieve the MDG\u2019s in developing countries. For example in 1990 developing countries had 18 per cent of international tourism receipts. By 2005 this had risen to 30 per cent and to date it continues to rise. There has been significant promotion of the direct economic links between tourists and the poor. Tourism may provide employment opportunities for marginalised groups, may bring direct income to individual communities and may promote equality in developing countries (Saarinen and Rogerson, 2013).\nUD supports destination competitiveness The tourism industry needs to design and deliver offerings and services that are suitable to all potential users and remove any physical or organisational barriers that can prevent visitation. UD incorporates the accessibility requirements of people with the widest possible range of abilities, so that the greatest number of people can use mainstream products and services without the need for adaptations or special interfaces. Additionally, mainstream products and services should use interface standards which match those of technical aids, so allowing disabled people to access and use mainstream equipment. UD has been defined as: Universal design is the design of products and environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design. The intent of the universal design concept is to simplify life for everyone by making products, communications, and the built environment more usable by more people at little or no extra cost. The universal design concept targets all people of all ages, sizes and abilities\u2019. The Universal Design approach goes beyond traditional design, which tends to focus on the \u2018average\u2019 user. Universal Design is a design approach, reflecting a way of understanding people\u2019s needs. It is not a list of particular solutions, measurements, or products \u2013 Universal Design is the way to reach the solution, contributing to social inclusion (cited in Center for Universal Design, 2009; and first articulated by Mace, 1985). Applying the principles of UD can be seen as a way of developing tourism environments, transportation, services and offers, underpinning sustainable communities and businesses. Today, according to a recent study by European Network for Accessible Tourism (2015a) and partners, less than 10 per cent of tourism suppliers in Europe offer \u201caccessible\u201d tourism services, while demand for such services is set to increase due to the ageing population and continuing upward trend in market demand. Adopting UD enlarges the target markets of destinations as well as ensures that more pleasant experiences can be delivered. Therefore it can increase the market base, reduce seasonality and support the competitiveness of destinations (Buhalis, 2000). Yet, few studies have examined accessible tourism in relation to destination management and only recently has accessible tourism been examined from destination competitiveness perspective (Dom\u00ednguez Vila et al., 2015).\nPapers in this issue To address these concepts and developments this special issue is bringing a range of papers together that discuss research on many accessibility tourism aspects. Naniopoulos and Tsalis (2015) discuss a methodology for addressing the accessibility of monuments. They focus on heritage attraction sites, highlighting the challenges with archaeological sites where interventions become problematic or even impossible. In doing so, they approached accessibility as a dual notion; accessibility of an area and its potential for independent physical access and movement around the monuments as well as perceived accessibility in terms of interpreting, understanding and learning from the environment. The methodology was applied to a number of byzantine monuments as part of a cultural route in the city of Thessaloniki in Greece, as case studies. Results provide both tools for assessing monument accessibility (process orientations and checklists) and insights into the needs of travellers with disabilities for more \u201cusable\u201d heritage attractions. Concluding remarks place a focus on the prerequisites of training and cooperation to allow for the future of accessible monuments to be realised. Tsalis et al. (2015) provide an interesting study on the challenges of implementing accessibility solutions, also within the context of protection, conservation, and management of historical centres and monuments. Viewed from a tourism perspective, archaeological sites and monuments are location bound and exist only in their original place. Hence, access to such sites enables unique and authentic tourism experiences. Discourses on objective, constructive and existential authenticity are of paramount importance when accessibility is concerned. This study provides relevant examples of accessibility interventions on six monuments as well as considerations on the design of the tools that assisted site interpretation and interconnection in a cultural route. Results demonstrate how accessibility improvements can occur while respecting the history, architecture and character of the monuments. The study concludes by emphasizing that it is primarily through providing greater access, that the \u201csocialisation\u201d of these monuments will propagate authentic tourism experiences in the future. Bowtell (2015) offers an examination of the market value and attractiveness of accessible tourism in Europe. Historic data were used to provide a forecast for 2025, while primary data obtained from travel and leisure companies provided insights into managerial perceptions. Findings show a very promising potential for accessible tourism market with significant projected revenues. However, a number of challenges including lack of awareness, cost of investments, complexity of customers\u2019 needs and legal inconsistencies within the EU, create barriers toward developing comprehensive solutions for accessible tourism. Authors provide recommendations on bridging demand and supply. Gillovic and McIntosh (2015) present an interesting study on stakeholder perspectives of the future of accessible tourism in New Zealand. The study provides insights into the current situation and the future propensity for an accessible tourism industry in New Zealand. A number of interviews with key stakeholders revealed that there is a need to develop a culture of accessibility that is perceived as the norm. Findings also include the business and demand arguments, but additionally highlighted the \u201cineptness\u201d of upper industry levels to recognize the opportunity of accessible tourism, exhibiting apathy and complacency instead. Authors conclude with recommendations for the future of accessible tourism in New Zealand which can easily be generalised for other regions. Zajadacz (2015) discusses the evolution of models of disability as a basis for the future development of accessible tourism. A review of medical, social, biopsychosocial, geographical and economic models of disability reveals the theoretical underpinnings and assumptions entailed in those. These are then linked to tourism, demonstrating that different models influence the tourism provision in terms of both products and services. Authors highlight the understanding of disability under different models toward diverse tourism experiences. Several suggestions are offered on the complementary of the models and the implications on the transformation of the accessible tourism industry in the future. Cruces Portales (2015) uses a scenario planning approach to envisage alternative futures for accessible tourism. With a timeframe leading to 2050, four alternative futures are unravelled through storytelling. The scenarios are built on a matrix that includes the opposing forces of empathy \u2013 apathy, and fear of loss and certainty of benefits. The resulting, aptly named scenarios (Eden Gardens, Golden Bridge, Wasted Future and State of Hope) showcase different behaviours, schedules of changes and insights. Authors conclude with strategic ideas and proposals for the future of accessible tourism.\nConclusion When exploring the future of tourism in this area two opposing trends can be observed: future societies are predicted to become more similar, more homogenous as a consequence of consumerism, globalisation and converging urban lifestyles. However, the accessible tourism market is characteristically diverse, with complex needs and the range of dreams and ambitions is boundless. Will future global travellers be able to access more varied and personal services or will increasing numbers of travellers give rise to greater standardization of services? Accessible tourism as an emerging field of study will influence tourism destination competitiveness in the future, whether that be from a human rights, emerging market segment or service delivery perspective. In this conceptual examination, we have presented implications of number of theoretical constructs and lenses through which accessible tourism will be influenced in the future. In this special issue, a number of future dimensions are explored that demonstrate how the field has moved from an examination of the intersection of disability and tourism, to one that is clearly defined through conceptual and definitional approaches as accessible tourism. There is a common thread amongst all the papers presented in this special issue. They focus around stakeholder collaboration, as a foundation for the future development of accessible tourism. It has been explicitly suggested that raising awareness amongst stakeholders is essential to overcome barriers inhibiting the application of solutions that enhance access. The importance of stakeholder collaboration across the accessible tourism value chain has been emphasized in a number of ways in this special issue. Improving accessibility of facilities, transportation, attractions and destinations more generally, demands the collaboration of a wide range of stakeholders including architects, designers, economists, local councils, policy makers, travellers with disabilities, historians and archaeologists to name a few. Therefore \u201csocialising\u201d tourism means that access can be granted only when a number of relevant stakeholders are in accord, work together and specifically developed strategies to target the accessible tourism market. Stakeholder collaboration is a key factor for developing accessible tourism solutions, recognising the value of the market and capitalising on it. Hence, a collaborative approach is required to recognise the complementary nature of the different paradigms; to re-shape and transform the future of the accessible tourism through influencing the tourism industry, contributing government organisations and the not-for-profit sectors. The strength and depth of stakeholder collaborations will determine alternative future realities; from a future where all cooperate and share benefits for all parties, to a fatalistic picture where each stakeholder is sailing alone because they consider their interests incompatible, and everything in between. UD should provide a better accessible tourism future that should enhance the competitiveness of tourism destinations and organisations."}, {"title": null, "article": null}, {"title": "Accessible Public Transportation Services", "article": "Accessible Public Transportation Services\nDifferent means of accessible transport are available to transport passengers from point of arrival to town centre\n1.

From minor annoyances to violent crimes, getting from point A to B can be fraught with risk.\nGoal 11 of the United Nations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sustainable development goals exhorts member states to provide safe, affordable, and accessible transportation for everyone, especially those who find themselves in vulnerable situations. And yet, while disparate initiatives have been launched around the world to make public commutes safer and accessible for everyone, a survey of the United Nations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and other international agencies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 research, plus our own analysis, suggests there is still more to be done across the three main stages of the commuter journey: planning and booking, the predeparture experience at boarding areas, and the travel itself.\nIn this article, we consider just how inclusive global public-transit systems are and explore ways that municipalities, urban planners, and other key stakeholders can assess and accommodate the end-to-end needs of all travelers.\nHow inclusive are our public-transit systems?\nOver the past decade, international organizations such as the United Nations have made the concerted effort to study inclusivity in urban-transport systems as a means to guarantee fair opportunities for all commuters. The insights that have come out of this endeavor fall under two broad themes.\nFirst, a collection of studies\u00e2\u0080\u0094including the UN Commission on the Status of Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Safe cities and safe public spaces for women and girls study\u00e2\u0080\u0094provide analyses of the key safety and communications issues that public-transport operators need to address. These include reducing violence and harassment on public transit, ensuring safer nighttime commutes, and providing clear, effective, around-the-clock communication between operators and travelers.\nSecond, a separate stream of research studies the main barriers that limit inclusion on public transit for women, people with disabilities, and low-income travelers, among others. Critical obstacles include, among others, poorly designed transportation, high ticket prices, inadequate safety regulations, and schedules that fail to account for the travel patterns of commuters with specific needs.\nAs they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve become aware of these issues and limitations, many public-transit system providers and urban planners have launched initiatives to address them\u00e2\u0080\u0094to limited effect, however. Such campaigns and programs have typically been introduced in an ad hoc manner rather than integrated into the overall public-transport system.\nSome cities, such as Los Angeles and Santiago, focused on surveying travel patterns of public-transit users, while others, including a major European capital and a large city in Southeast Asia, mostly worked on communication campaigns to raise awareness of nighttime safety. Other cities\u00e2\u0080\u0099 efforts were limited in scope. In Madrid, for example, on-demand bus stops were introduced on suburban routes during specific times to reduce the walking distance home for female passengers.\nFrom booking to travel: An end-to-end approach to inclusion\nShare From the inside out: Inclusion in the urban-transport workforce According to the latest Kantar Inclusion Index, less than half of transportation employees believe that their organizations are actively pursuing inclusion. In addition, the sector reports above-average workplace bullying/harassment and situations in which employees were made to feel uncomfortable. Fostering greater inclusion for public-transport employees requires providers to start with an accurate assessment of where they stand. Then, they can begin embarking on diversity, equity, and inclusion\u00c2 (DEI) transformation journeys to reshape their way of working. Diversity refers to workforce composition across various identity-related characteristics, such as gender, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, and disabilities. Equity focuses on ensuring that identity is not predictive of opportunities or workplace outcomes. Inclusion refers to the degree to which an individual feels that they can bring their authentic selves to work, enabling them to contribute in a meaningful and deliberate manner. From our experience working in this space, public-transport providers can gain DEI awareness in different ways. Sometimes targeted, eye-opening workshops aimed at uncovering deeply rooted unconscious bias represent a wake-up call for organizations: having diverse subsets of colleagues collaborate to identify unexpected biases in their ways of thinking is sometimes sufficient to trigger top-management engagement toward a new way of working. In other cases, transport agencies go even further and fully train their staff on civil-rights issues, among others, and on potential biases toward underrepresented categories. In other cases, achieving a profound understanding of the internal level of inclusivity can require more time and various sessions at all levels of the organization. Once companies agree that room for improvement exists, the journey to a fully inclusive work environment unfolds. After the first step of assessing and building the fact base through company-specific business cases, other challenging steps of the process remain: Architect (development of key performance indicators and road map): beginning with a solid awareness and understanding of the internal level of inclusion, companies develop a plan by designing a portfolio of initiatives linked to specific and tangible objectives, prioritizing them on feasibility and expected impact. The initiatives plan is complemented by the identification of pilots to be launched and tested, either on selected perimeters or on a company-wide basis.\nAct (test and learn with quick programs): companies start launching pilots and initiatives on target business units, functions, and geographies, in line with the agreed-upon implementation plan. As the plan unfolds, insights from pilots can be used to learn and refine ongoing and future initiatives.\nAdvance (build on success and track progress): in the core phase of the implementation, companies get the program to full scale. This requires a strong monitoring and accountability structure, alongside a proven knowledge codification and sharing system to constantly improve idea generation and the implementation of initiatives. Among public-transportation providers, one of the most notable programs in the past few years was launched by the roads and transport authority in a major city in the Middle East, which focused on including and elevating women\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, it created a dedicated fund for high-performing women employees and another initiative for \u00e2\u0080\u009cpeople of determination,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which included ad hoc employment and training programs.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time for urban-transport providers to draw from our collective understanding of inclusion and design and implement an urban-transport system that works for everyone. While this article focuses on the customer journey, travel providers should not miss the opportunity to transform their own organizations as well (see sidebar, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom the inside out: Inclusion in the urban-transport workforce\u00e2\u0080\u009d).\nTo further contribute to our existing understanding of travel and inclusion, we conducted our own research. We surveyed more than 20 different public-transport operators around the world and identified key requirements and initiatives for an inclusive public-transport system. We found that while there are many initiatives to enhance inclusion, they are typically not part of an integrated, 360-degree framework. We believe that a comprehensive and integrated approach to inclusive transportation comprises initiatives that fall into six categories (Exhibit 1).\n1\nWe mapped these requirements and initiatives along the commuter journey, which we broke down into three parts: the booking stage, the predeparture stage, and the actual travel experience (Exhibit 2). In each phase, there are actions travel providers can take to address specific pain points. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll explore those actions using the example of a rail-based journey\u00e2\u0080\u0094although the conceptual principles here can be applied to other forms of urban transport, such as buses and ferries.\n2\nThe booking stage\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s common nowadays for people to use navigation apps to find the most convenient route to their destination. The would-be passenger decides on the starting and arrival points, preferred mode of transport, and time of travel. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll factor in potential route disruptions (and explore alternatives, if necessary), how crowded the commute might be, and whether there are any loyalty-program benefits to be accrued.\nThis stage presents a number of potential pain points for some commuters. For instance, a wheelchair user may not know if a train station is equipped with elevators and if there are design barriers that may make it difficult to board and alight from a train.\nSome cities have tried to create a more accessible and safe experience for senior travelers. For instance, Salzburg has launched initiatives to promote the use of public transport among older people. The city has hosted \u00e2\u0080\u009cmobility days,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and pamphlets on commuter safety can be found in all train stations. Salzburg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bus drivers are also trained to be extra vigilant around older passengers, and vehicles are designed with senior citizens in mind. These initiatives have reduced accidents among older people and increased awareness among the remaining population.\nOur research points to a number of actions urban-transport providers can take at the booking and planning stage to create more inclusion. For instance, they could create pooling options in their travel apps so that passengers could choose to commute in groups. They may offer special rates at this stage as well, to disabuse people of the idea that accessible travel options are more expensive than standard ones. Passengers could also be given the option to easily share their itinerary with their friends and loved ones for an additional layer of oversight.\nTravel providers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 mobile apps may also provide a direct line of communication between the traveler and the provider and are a tool providers may want to use more strategically. Safety issues could be flagged immediately. Information about security measures, optimal travel times, and easy-access facilities could be relayed through this channel when passengers check and confirm their itinerary. The Transport for London, for instance, allows for just this with its dedicated journey planner; the app lets would-be passengers optimize their journey from the booking stage.\nPredeparture phase\nArriving at a station or terminal can be an overwhelming experience, with hordes of people crisscrossing in every possible direction\u00e2\u0080\u0094businesspeople rushing to catch their trains with barely minutes to spare, families trying to herd rowdy children toward the right platform, and buskers plying their craft.\nFor many, the predeparture phase looks like this: you receive a push notification from your travel provider with information about your train\u00e2\u0080\u0099s departure time. To get to the platform you go through a thermal-imaging scanner that checks your temperature, you make it past the turnstile with an electronic ticket, and you find the correct platform, where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll wait to board.\nFor groups or travelers with specific logistical needs, this phase can be full of hazards. If they are early for their train, for instance, such passengers may find few accessible waiting spaces to accommodate them.\nThere are a number of ways urban-travel providers can improve the predeparture experience for all travelers. They may want to integrate important safety and pooling information into the departure reminder, noting the location of accessible facilities and safe train cars\u00e2\u0080\u0094carriages with an attendant, conductor, or security officer. Visual \u00e2\u0080\u009cnudges\u00e2\u0080\u009d and cues could promote positive behaviors, such as offering assistance to people with mobility constraints or to pregnant women. In stations where longer wait times are common, more rooms for nursing mothers and a greater number of dedicated waiting areas could be created. Treating the station as a civic space by promoting community-focused activities\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as increasing retail outlets and installing open pianos\u00e2\u0080\u0094could also enhance commuters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sense of safety.\nIn 2006, the city of Graz, Austria, upgraded its key stops to make them both more accessible and livable; and, targeting both safety and comfort in its train platforms and stations, the Canadian cities of Ottawa and Toronto created designated Transecure waiting areas.\nTraveling and arriving at the destination\nThere are a number of actions travel providers can take to make passengers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 journeys inclusive once they are on board. For instance, it is possible for travelers on most trains to track their progress while en route\u00e2\u0080\u0094but it may not always be clear how to request help in cases of violence of harassment. Particularly when it comes to late-night routes, passengers may be in near-empty train cars. To provide peace of mind for all passengers, urban-travel planners should install highly visible GPS panic buttons throughout the system, as they have in New Delhi and Bangalore.\nCommuters with specific needs could be directed to the train\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safe wagons with security personnel and closer supervision. Pregnant women or passengers with specific physical needs could wear \u00e2\u0080\u009cMay I sit\u00e2\u0080\u009d pins to alert other commuters to give way to them. Travel providers could also make it easier for these commuters to find information about connections and the safest ways to get to the next boarding point.\nWhile our case study focuses on rail travel, alternative transport modes may offer other opportunities for greater inclusion. The flexibility afforded by bus travel presents more options for making the travel experience safer. Passengers could be allowed to alight, on request, at specific time slots, for example, from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m., to reduce the distance between the drop-off point to the final destination. This is exactly what the city of Madrid put in place, arranging on-demand night bus stops on interurban bus lines.\nCreating an inclusive urban-transport system doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop the moment a passenger gets off the train. Transport providers could review the arrival experiences and partner with security companies to provide additional support or with taxi and rideshare companies to provide special rates for arriving passengers.\nSetting the goal of an entirely accessible public-transport system is becoming increasingly common in major cities worldwide. Barcelona has committed to a 100 percent accessible underground metro system by 2024, and Seattle is already fully wheelchair accessible.\nOther municipalities and travel providers can do the same by undertaking a thorough assessment of customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 needs along the whole journey, mapping the potential pain points, and implementing targeted initiatives to address them. Of course, this process is an iterative one; any initiatives launched should be evaluated and refined over time. The systemic, end-to-end approach outlined in this article should help make traveling in our cities truly safer for all."}, {"title": null, "article": null}, {"title": "Wheelchair Accessible Transportation Options When Traveling", "article": "For wheelchair users, accessible transportation can become a fundamental consideration when planning a trip.

While some destinations may not provide many accessible rental vehicles or ride-shares, others offer exceptional wheelchair accessible public transportation, which may be the best option for traveling within the city. Places like San Fransisco, New York, and Europe as a whole have excellent public transportation. In either case, it is important to research as much as you can so you\u2019re well prepared and know what to expect.\nConnecting with other travelers can be a great resource for preparing for your trip.

WAVs are specially designed (or adapted) vehicles of any kind that allows wheelchair users to enter and exit the vehicle with ease. These vehicles have lowered floors and a ramp or lift that allows the wheelchair to be rolled into the vehicle. The interior is designed to accommodate the wheelchair user, with features such as wheelchair tie-downs and accessible controls that allow the user to travel in their wheelchair safely. Some WAVs are also equipped with features such as hand controls for driving, power lifts, and transfer seats to make the transportation experience even more comfortable and convenient for the user.\nAccessible ramps into van.\nWheelchair Accessible Rental Van Services\nFor those who require more specialized transportation, accessible vans can be a great option. These vehicles are designed specifically to accommodate wheelchair users, with features such as wheelchair lifts and tie-downs. Accessible vans can be scheduled through phone or email.\nAt Wheel the World we work with several wheelchair accessible van providers in various destinations around the world, such as Morocco, Chile, Mexico, Costa Rica, France, Spain, Israel, and Qatar, to name a few.\n\u267f Need help with transportation, van rental, and/or insurance for your trip? Request a quote , hear back in less than one business day.\nWAV Options at Ride-Sharing Services\nRide-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft provide accessibility through their WAV option. Typically, the vehicles are minivans or something similar, and the rates are usually the same as a standard UberX. Keep in mind that these aren\u2019t available in every city, so if you\u2019re considering using ride-sharing on your trip, make sure you research to see if it\u2019s a viable option at your destination. At this time, some of the current cities where WAV is offered and has solid availability:\nNew York\nSan Francisco\nPortland\nBoston\nSeattle\nToronto\nWheelchair accessible transportation in Costa Rica\nAccessible Public Transportation\nMany public transportation systems offer wheelchair accessible options, such as buses and trains, while others offer paratransit services for those who are unable to use traditional public transportation. It is important to plan ahead and research the accessibility options in your area because not all public transportation systems are fully accessible.\nIn the U.S, public transportation is not accessible in every destination:\nBus transportation is accessible in almost every city, but can be very ineffective due to the lack of coverage in many cases. Research the bus routes at your destination and see if it would be a good option for you.\nThe San Francisco BART is almost 100% accessible. Every station has elevators, and although they are not very clean, it covers a majority of the city.\nOutside of the U.S there are many cities that we have identified with good public transportation. A few examples are:\nBarcelona, Spain - Great train and bus systems that are fully accessible.\nLondon, England - The buses have great accessibility and the Underground has a number of accessible stations, especially the ones around downtown.\nBerlin, Germany - Most subway stations are accessible.\nSantiago, Chile - The majority of subway stations and buses are accessible. Staying in the Vitacura/Providencia area of the city will allow you to use the subway and buses and go around accessible areas of the city.\nWheelchair lift into public transportation (bus)\nWheelchair Accessible Dispatch Taxis\nWheelchair-accessible dispatch taxi services are another great option for those who require specialized transportation. These services allow users to schedule a ride in an accessible taxi that has been designed to accommodate wheelchair users. These services can be scheduled in advance, allowing you to plan you transportation needs more conveniently. However, it's important to keep in mind that not every destination may offer these services, so it's important to research your options in advance.\nConclusion\nAlthough finding accessible transportation can be a challenge, there are several options available to wheelchair users. By exploring these alternatives, you can find the transportation option that works best for your needs and helps you maintain your independence and mobility. Remember to plan ahead, check availability, and always prioritize safety when traveling.

It addresses both countries where improvements to accessibility are under way, and those that are just now making that commitment.\nWith examples from recent experience in a wide range of countries, this Guide updates the ECMT\u2019s 1999 Guide, pointing to areas where progress has been made as well as to those where challenges persist."}, {"title": "For Persons with Disabilities, Accessible Transport Provides Pathways to Opportunity", "article": "If your daily commute forces you to waste precious hours stuck in traffic or to elbow your way into overcrowded public transit vehicles, you probably need little convincing about the importance of good quality, reliable transport. Now, imagine your frustration if, instead of simply dealing with less-than-perfect transport, you had to make do with no transport at all.\nFor many persons with disabilities, this is not just fiction, but a daily struggle that is all too real: a large proportion of urban and inter-urban transport systems remain either completely off-limits or incredibly difficult to use for passengers with disabilities, turning even the shortest trip into a logistical nightmare.\nMobility constraints are a major obstacle to disability-inclusive development, as they exacerbate the economic, social, and personal isolation of persons with disabilities, and tend to push them further into poverty.\nBut the opposite is also true: coupled with interventions in other areas, mobility improvements can go a long way in changing the lives of persons with disabilities for the better. \u201cYou have to think of transport as an equalizer, a catalyst that facilitates access to many other sectors,\u201d said Charlotte McClain-Nhlapo, the World Bank\u2019s Global Advisor on Disability. \u201cMobility improvements are key because transport gives you access to jobs, schools, healthcare, markets, leisure.\u201d\nSupporting disability-inclusive transport through infrastructure financing and knowledge sharing\nAs a key financier of transport infrastructure and a global thought leader on inclusive development, the World Bank has been in a unique position to promote universally accessible transport through a variety of interventions:\nLending operations : transport is the World Bank\u2019s largest sector in terms of overall lending (21% of the institution\u2019s active portfolio), and is also one of the most active when it comes to disability inclusion. The Bank\u2019s experts have been working hand in hand with client countries to integrate the principles of \u201cuniversal design\u201d into transport projects, especially physical upgrades such as access ramps, elevators, tactile surfaces on platforms, braille signage, low-floor vehicles, audio and visual announcements, etc.\n: transport is the World Bank\u2019s largest sector in terms of overall lending (21% of the institution\u2019s active portfolio), and is also one of the most active when it comes to disability inclusion.

In the transport sector, our experts have developed an extensive knowledge base to help stakeholders understand the technical aspects of universally accessible transport. Training and capacity-building: \u201cCapacity issues can be a serious hurdle in moving from words to action,\u201d pointed out Senior Transport Specialist Julie Babinard. \u201cMany countries do not have specific standards about universally accessible transport. In other cases, transport engineers may be unfamiliar with the complexities of universal design. Finally, it is essential to educate bus drivers, station agents and other staff about the needs of passengers with limited mobility.\u201d\nLegislation and mentalities are changing\nWith the demand for transport infrastructure and services at an all-time high, now is the time to make sure that accessible transport becomes the rule rather than the exception.\nFortunately, awareness of disability is growing and mentalities are changing. \u201cOverall, it has become easier for us to make a case for accessible transport, as our clients understand that, if you want to create sustainable communities, you need to include everyone,\u201d noted Ram\u00f3n Mu\u00f1oz-Raskin, Senior Urban Transport Specialist at the World Bank. \u201cIn many of the countries we work with, universal access is now pretty much a no-brainer, at least for mass transit systems like metro, light rail, or Bus Rapid Transit.\u201d\nThe legislation has evolved as well. The 2006 United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, in particular, provides that: \u201cStates Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access, on an equal basis with others, [\u2026] to transport\u201d (art. 9). The Convention has been ratified by and is legally binding in 160 countries. At the national level, countries across regions and income groups have passed legislation to protect the rights of persons with disabilities.\nData: the new frontier for disability-inclusive transport\nOf course, challenges remain; chief among them is the lack of reliable, disaggregated data on disability and disability-inclusive transport. \u201cWithout statistical evidence, it is much harder to drive policy change and to measure the impact of accessible transport projects,\u201d noted Charlotte McClain-Nhlapo. \u201cHopefully, the 7 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that include disability will create an impetus for more and better data, as progress toward each of the SDGs will have to be clearly measured,\u201d she added.\nConcerns about cost are another persistent hurdle. However, experts agree that the incremental cost of providing universal access is usually minimal in new or \u201cgreenfield\u201d projects, whereas retrofitting existing systems comes with a much heftier price tag. \u201cThat is why accessibility should be factored into projects right from the start; for older systems that can\u2019t be retrofitted, we need to find creative and realistic alternatives,\u201d said Charlotte McClain-Nhlapo.\n\u201cWhen considering the cost of accessibility, you also need to keep in mind that universal design does not just improve the mobility of persons with disabilities, but brings co-benefits to many others: you have to think about the elderly, parents pushing strollers, and all those who may be dealing with temporary physical impairments,\u201d she added.\nLocal communities hold the key to successful projects\nInvolving Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) has been instrumental in securing buy-in from local authorities, for governments tend to pay closer attention to grievances coming from their own constituents (read about Liaoning Medium Cities Infrastructure Project for an interesting example from China).\nIn addition, working with CSOs helps ensure that new projects truly meet the needs of persons with disabilities: when it comes to making transport universally accessible, the devil is most definitely in the detail, and a simple oversight or minor construction flaw can render a whole system unusable.\nInput from local associations of persons with disabilities is critical to making sure that transport systems designed to be accessible have been \u201cused and approved\u201d by those who need them most."}, {"title": "Special Needs Travel Adventures", "article": "After you officially book a Trips Inc.

Continued...\nWhat is Accessible Tourism?\nAccessible Tourism, as defined by Darcy and Dickson (2009, p34);\nAccessible tourism is the ongoing endeavor to ensure tourist destinations, products, and services are accessible to all people, regardless of their physical limitations, disabilities, or age.\nAccessible tourism encompasses publicly and privately owned tourist locations.\nAccessible tourism enables people with access requirements, including mobility, vision, hearing and cognitive dimensions of access, to function independently and with equity and dignity through the delivery of universally designed tourism products, services, and environments.\nThis definition is inclusive of all people, including those traveling with children in prams, people with disabilities and seniors.\nNoting the obstacles that persons with disabilities, or those with other access requirements, face in taking advantage of fundamental aspects of travel, senior United Nations (UN) officials urge policy-makers, travel planners and companies that work with persons with disabilities to work together to make travel more accessible.\nSpecific problems often encountered by the disabled tourist when trying to book a holiday, scenic tours, and accommodation can include:\nLack of well-adapted hotel rooms\nLack of accessible airport transfer\nLack of wheelchair accessible vehicles\nLack of accessible restaurants, bars, etc.\nInaccessible, or only partly accessible, websites\nLack of adapted toilets in restaurants and public places\nInaccessible streets (cars parking on the sidewalk, etc.)\nLack of professional staff capable of informing and advising about accessibility issues\nLack of disability equipment (wheelchairs, bath chairs, toilet raisers, electric scooters)\nLack of reliable information about a specific attraction's level of accessibility (church, castle, exhibition, etc.)\nDisability Travel Tips\nBicycle shops are great places for wheelchair replacement parts.\nLearn foreign vocabulary that can help you describe your situation and needs.\nConsider getting travel insurance. Make sure that it covers pre-existing conditions.\nBring plenty, even extra, of any medications that you take. Make sure that all medicines are allowed in the country you're visiting.\nLook for disability organizations or resources at your destination that can provide you with area-specific information as well as local contacts.\nIf you use an electric wheelchair, look into whether you'll need a plug adapter and a voltage converter. Or see whether you can rent a battery charger abroad. Have a contingency plan if power outages or voltage drops.\nHave a backup plan, including your accommodation. In case your reserved accessible room isn't available, bring along items such as a portable ramp, a shower chair and a reacher to grab items that may be beyond arm's length.\nKnow your rights. This is particularly important for airline travel, at the airport and on the plane. Familiarize yourself with applicable laws and airline regulations. Inform the airline of your situation and make assistance requests in advance.\nUnderstand cultural differences. You may get more, or less, attention in other countries than you would in the United States. Then again, Roth-Vinson says, you may stand out more as an American than as a wheelchair user or a blind person.\nMajor Airline Travel Tips for Travelers with Disabilities - Jessica Padykula - (2015-02-12)\nTips to Make Traveling with a Disability Easier - Helen Hecker - (2008-12-24)\nWheelchair Travel Tips - J.D. - (2010-07-01)\nSubtopics and Associated Subjects\nadvertisement"}, {"title": "5 Great Tour Companies for Disabled Travelers\u200b", "article": "Wheelchair user Elissa Fischer, 64, has ataxia, a brain disease that affects her speech, coordination and ability to walk.

Our blog articles are written independently by our editorial team. They have not been paid for or sponsored by our partners. See our full editorial guidelines .\nReasonable accommodations are adjustments to a hiring process, work environment, or job responsibilities so an employee with disabilities can apply for or perform their job. Depending on the type of disability, accommodations can look many different ways \u2014 from transcription services to accessible parking outside the office. In this guide, we\u2019ll share more about reasonable accommodations, examples, and how to request them in your job search or at your first job.\nWhat Are Reasonable Accommodations at Work?\nWork accommodations are changes to a hiring process, work environment, or job responsibilities that allow an employee with a disability to apply for or do their job.\nWhat makes an accommodation \u201creasonable?\u201d An accommodation is \u201creasonable\u201d if it doesn\u2019t create an undue hardship on the employer \u2014 meaning it isn\u2019t exceptionally difficult or expensive for the employer to make the accommodation.\nNot every employee with a disability needs the same accommodation; accommodations depend on the individual\u2019s needs and how it affects their ability to do their job. For example, reasonable accommodations can include:\nTechnical access, like an employee with impaired hearing who uses a transcription service\nPhysical accommodations, like a ramp for the office to make it accessible to an employee in a wheelchair\nChanges to work schedules, like more flexible hours for an employee who has mental health challenges and may need more rest periods\nThese accommodations make it so every employee, regardless of ability, can succeed in their job.\nPower BI Passionate about advocating for employees with disabilities and other underrepresented groups in the workplace?

Some common reasonable accommodations include:\nChange of job tasks\nFlexible work schedules, including remote jobs\nImproved office accessibility\nSpecialized software or equipment\nAlternative supervisory structure or methods\nAlternative formats of communication (written versus verbal communication, for example)\nReassignment\nHere\u2019s how some of these accommodations function for various disabilities.\nADHD\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that can affect an employee\u2019s ability to focus, prioritize tasks, stay organized, and control impulses. In the workplace, accommodations for ADHD allow these employees to be productive in a way that works for them \u2014 mainly through adjustments to work schedules and environments.\nExamples of ADHD accommodations at work include:\nA flexible schedule that allows an employee to work when their energy and focus levels are best\nA private or quiet workspace so an employee can work distraction-free\nTask organization tools or software to help an employee prioritize and stay on task\nAdjustments to meetings to make them shorter, have more breaks, and provide a clear agenda beforehand\nMental Health\nMental health conditions like depression and anxiety can affect an employee\u2019s ability to be productive, work closely with others, and work on a typical 9-5 schedule.\nExamples of reasonable accommodations for mental health conditions include:\nFlexible work schedules for an employee who needs to take time during the workday for treatment\nRemote work for an employee who experiences intense social anxiety\nPermission to bring a support animal to the office\nSupportive and direct supervision style for an employee who needs positive reinforcement and feedback\nA quiet work environment, either by providing a space for the employee to work distraction-free or technology like noise-canceling headphones\nPhysical Disabilities\nReasonable accommodations for physical disabilities vary widely and depend on the kind of physical disability a person has. For example, a blind employee and an employee in a wheelchair need very different accommodations to perform their jobs.\nExamples of reasonable accommodations for physical disabilities include:\nAssistive technology, like screen readers, voice recognition software, Braille displays, and specialized input devices to help an employee process or communicate information\nAdjustable workstations for an employee with a physical impairment\nWheelchair accessible offices\nFlexible work arrangements, including working from home, for employees who find it challenging to commute or need time for treatment\nAdjusting job tasks that require physical labor\nDiabetes\nEmployees with diabetes may experience a range of symptoms depending on how their diabetes affects them. For example, some employees may have diabetic neuropathy, a nerve disorder caused by diabetes that affects nerves in the hands and feet. Others may experience diabetic retinopathy, an eye condition that can affect vision.\nExamples of reasonable accommodations for diabetes include:\nFlexible work schedules or regular breaks to check blood glucose levels, eat, take medication, or go to the bathroom\nAccess to technology to regularly check blood glucose levels\nPermission to use a chair or stool for an employee with diabetic neuropathy\nA larger screen, screen readers, or Braille displayers for an employee with diabetic retinopathy\nPregnancy\nPregnancy is not a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); however, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA) is a new law that requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations to employees who experience limitations because of pregnancy, childbirth, or other related medical conditions. These work accommodations include adjustments to work schedules and changes to job tasks.\nExamples of reasonable accommodations for pregnancy in the PWFA include:\nFlexible hours or additional time to eat and rest\nAccess to accessible parking spots\nLeave or time off to recover from childbirth\nExcusal from strenuous physical activity or activities that may expose an employee to compounds not safe for pregnancy\nPregnancy and Breastfeeding\nWhile the PWFA does not have any specific guidance about breast milk pumping, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) specifically covers nursing mothers in the workplace.\nThe PPACA includes two main reasonable accommodations:\nBreak time for an employee to express breast milk, up to one year after giving birth\nA private place out of view and free of intrusion, other than a bathroom, to express breast milk\nReturn to Work for Parents and Carers Coming back from parental or caregiving leave?

According to the ADA National Network, you\u2019re allowed to request \u2014 and must gain access to \u2014 reasonable accommodations at work, as long as:\nYou\u2019re qualified for the position, meaning you\u2019re able to perform the job\u2019s essential functions\nYou meet the definition of \u201cdisability\u201d according to the ADA, meaning you have a \u201cphysical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities\u201d\nThe accommodation doesn\u2019t create an undue burden on the employer, meaning an exceptional difficulty or expense\nReasonable Accommodation Request Process\nReasonable accommodations, by law, must be addressed on a case-by-case basis. According to the ADA Network, the process is as follows:\nAn employee must disclose their disability to their employer and explain how the disability is affecting their ability to do their job. The employee and employer discuss how the disability is affecting the employee\u2019s ability to work and share potential solutions. If the employee\u2019s need for an accommodation is not obvious, the employer can request preliminary documentation of the disability. The employee and employer both provide input on what an effective solution would be. The employer makes the final decision on what the accommodation(s) will be. The employer either implements the accommodation(s) or denies the accommodation request.\nIt\u2019s up to the employee to bring their accommodation request to the employer. While the employer does have the final say, if an employee has a disability, it\u2019s their right to receive reasonable accommodations. They should actively participate in discussions on what those accommodations should be.\nHow to Request Reasonable Accommodations When You\u2019re Just Starting Out\nSo, you\u2019re thinking of requesting reasonable accommodations, whether you\u2019re in your first job search or have just landed your first role. We\u2019ve outlined the step-by-step process, but how should those conversations go?\nIt\u2019s best to be proactive and straightforward while focusing on how you\u2019ll be able to thrive in the role.\n\u201cThe best way is to confront and call out the problem and your expectations directly,\u201d says Roza Szafranek, founder and CEO at HR Hints. \u201cIt is good to clearly name from the beginning what is important to us and ask, for example, about arrangements for hybrid work, the need to work with a mask in common spaces, or the distance between desks in the office, if these are important to us.\u201d\nRequest Examples\nKraig Kleeman, CEO and founder of The New Workforce, a company that connects businesses with talent, gives an example of how someone on the job hunt with ADHD \u2014 who knows they might need extra breaks during the day \u2014 might request accommodations.\n>>MORE: How Can You Tell if an Employer Values Diversity and Inclusion in the Workplace?\n\u201cResearch the companies you\u2019re applying to and check if they have info on accommodations on their websites,\u201d Kleeman says. \u201cOnce you get an offer, that\u2019s the time to discuss your needs.

Kleeman advises being proactive about your accommodations and bringing them up on day one.\n\u201cTalk to HR or your supervisor early on,\u201d he says. \u201cLike, on your first day, if you can. Share what you need to thrive in your role. It\u2019s a collaboration; you and your employer work together to make it happen. Be ready with any required documents and keep a positive attitude. Focus on how you can rock your new job.\u201d\nWhat to Do If an Employer Denies Your Reasonable Accommodation Request\nUnfortunately, not all reasonable accommodation requests will be approved.\n\u201cApplication rejection happens often,\u201d Szafranek says. \u201cThe most common reasons are savings and lack of willingness or ability to take on more responsibilities in terms of managing the problems of the employed team. Company and team leaders are focusing on optimizing and simplifying everything that does not bring additional revenue and increases the efficiency of the team\u2019s work, so if they consider that, for example, they are unable to negotiate work from the office, they will not budge.\u201d\nWhile an employer might feel strongly that their decision is final, you can try to negotiate a rejection or take further action.\n\u201cIf they do say no, don\u2019t lose heart,\u201d Kleeman says. \u201cTalk to them, explain why it\u2019s essential, and try to work something out. It\u2019s a two-way street. If you do take further action, contact the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for help. They can mediate or investigate. If all else fails, you can consider legal action. But remember, that\u2019s usually the last resort. So, don\u2019t be afraid to speak up and advocate for your needs.

In disability employment antidiscrimination law and policy, perhaps the most important driver of the inclusion command is the \u201caccommodation principle,\u201d which requires that employers make reasonable adjustments to tasks and places of work to enable full and equal participation by qualified individuals with disabilities [2].\nIn the seminal 2004 U.S. Supreme Court case Tennessee v. Lane [3], the late Justice Ruth Ginsburg wrote of the centrality of the ADA\u2019s accommodation principle:\nIncluding individuals with disabilities among people who count in composing \u201cWe the People,\u201d Congress understood in shaping the ADA, would sometimes require not blindfolded equality, but responsiveness to difference; not indifference, but accommodation. Central to the Act\u2019s primary objective, Congress extended the statute\u2019s range to reach all government activities, [], and required \u2026 \u201creasonable accommodations.\u201d\nUnder the ADA, the word \u201cdiscriminate\u201d consequently includes failure to make reasonable accommodations to the physical and mental limitations of a qualified individual with a disability, in the absence of an \u201cundue hardship\u201d on the business [1]. Discrimination includes denying opportunities to a job applicant or employee if such denial is based on the need for the entity to make reasonable accommodations to that person\u2019s physical or mental conditions [1]. By directing employers to accept responsibility, within reason, for accommodations (up to the undue hardship ceiling), the ADA\u2019s Title I sets the ADA apart from other U.S. civil rights legislation.\nThe importance of the accommodation principle to disability inclusive employment law and policy is manifest [4]. The goal of offering equal employment opportunity to everyone, regardless of disability, is meaningless if the new hire uses a wheelchair and the sole entrance to the workplace is up a flight of stairs. The right to work rings hollow if people who are deaf or hard of hearing, who are blind or have low vision, or who have reading or cognitive disabilities cannot use or access a company\u2019s web-based technologies [5]. Opportunity is foreclosed when an employer will not alter work schedules within reason, or bars telework or remote work, without consideration for qualified individuals with episodic or mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety, that require flexibility [6].\nTitle I of the ADA defines the accommodation principle to include, within reason, making facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, as well as job restructuring, part-time and modified work schedules, remote work and telecommuting, modification of equipment and devices, and other effective means of enabling qualified individuals with disabilities to perform essential functions of their jobs, whether traditional or non-traditional [1]. The ADA gives substantial weight to an employer\u2019s definition of \u201cessential\u201d job functions and the extent to which such tasks may be done effectively with accommodation.\nResearch shows the low costs and the numerous benefits of the accommodation principle. Most workplace accommodations incur de minimis or near-zero costs [7,8,9,10]. Employers in most cases can accommodate people with disabilities with relative ease, formally or informally. Further, there are far-reaching, positive ripple effects from a \u201cculture of accommodation\u201d for all [11, 12]. At the organizational level, accommodations improve employee productivity, morale, and tenure. If an organization promotes a \u201cculture of inclusion,\u201d a climate of flexible and supportive approaches, it furthers effective and innovative accommodations and productive outcomes for all employees and for itself [9, 10, 13,14,15], and it enjoys the benefits of attracting and retaining qualified workers [13]. The ripple effect extends even further: promoting economic opportunity for people with disabilities produces a corresponding decrease in their need for federal disability insurance and other governmental support funding, along with a resultant increase in tax revenues.\nThe research thus suggests the value, to all of society, of documenting, devising, and promoting strategies to increase awareness and implementation of the accommodation principle across organizations of different sizes and types, and across market and labor sectors.\nAt the thirtieth anniversary of the ADA, the articles in this special topic section consider, variously, the future of disability-inclusive employment in light of how the accommodation principle works in contemporary society, and in light of its historical precedents. The accommodation principle as part of a disability inclusive employment paradigm is a concept of the late twentieth century. It contrasts with earlier vocational rehabilitation programs for people with disabilities, which historically were based on medicalized conceptions of disability [1, 16]. This \u201cMedical Model\u201d of disability focused on individual deficits, with impairments conceived of as infirmities that precluded participation in the mainstream economy [17, 18]. It cast people with disabilities in a subordinate role to doctors, rehabilitation professionals, and governmental bureaucrats, each of whom aimed to \u201chelp them,\u201d when \u201cdeserving,\u201d adjust to a society structured around the convenience, design, and interests of people without disabilities [17].\nIn contrast, the modern model is the Social Model of disability, which is sometimes called the Ecological Model, and, in the context of the ADA, the Disability Civil Rights Model. This model, however named, includes the accommodation principle. It has changed society\u2019s perspective. It has altered the historical paradigm from a focus on a health status to be cured or rehabilitated, and even pitied, towards acceptance of individual differences as human traits that are accommodated in employment, and generally in society, as a natural part of the human experience.\nThe Social Model of disability has taken on exceptional importance due to the health and economic emergency arising from the global pandemic [19, 20]. The pandemic is challenging public and private entities in unprecedented ways to spur both traditional and new forms of employment and economic opportunity for all. But people with disabilities are presently experiencing among the highest rates of job loss, as compared to those without disabilities, from the health and economic emergency [21, 22].\nLest we forget, too, people with disabilities often own or identify with multiple minority identities that are themselves marginalized in our society. People with disabilities, for example, may also be women, people of color, and/or individuals identifying with different sexual orientations and gender identities [23,24,25].

These modifications enable an individual with a disability to have an equal opportunity not only to get a job, but successfully perform their job tasks to the same extent as people without disabilities. The ADA requires reasonable accommodations as they relate to three aspects of employment: 1) ensuring equal opportunity in the application process; 2) enabling a qualified individual with a disability to perform the essential functions of a job; and 3) making it possible for an employee with a disability to enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment.\nAccommodations are sometimes referred to as \u201cproductivity enhancers\u201d. Reasonable accommodations should not be viewed as \u201cspecial treatment\u201d and they often benefit all employees. For example, facility enhancements such as ramps, accessible restrooms, and ergonomic workstations benefit more than just employees with disabilities. Examples of reasonable accommodations include making existing facilities accessible; job restructuring; part-time or modified work schedules; acquiring or modifying equipment; changing tests, training materials, or policies; and providing qualified readers or interpreters. Here are some more examples. Many job accommodations cost very little and often involve minor changes to a work environment, schedule or work-related technologies:\nPhysical changes Installing a ramp or modifying a rest room Modifying the layout of a workspace\nAccessible and assistive technologies Ensuring computer software is accessible Providing screen reader software Using videophones to facilitate communications with colleagues who are deaf\nAccessible communications Providing sign language interpreters or closed captioning at meetings and events Making materials available in Braille or large print\nPolicy enhancements Modifying a policy to allow a service animal in a business setting Adjusting work schedules so employees with chronic medical conditions can go to medical appointments and complete their work at alternate times or locations\nThese are just a few example.

And these travelers represent, according to the Amadeus Accessibility Study, a \"$70 billion market\" just in Europe and the USA.\nThis fact alone would make a strong business case for investing time, effort, and resources needed to become more accessible and inclusive as a business and as an industry. But beyond the economic imperative, there are important reasons for the tourism industry to take this segment seriously.\nBelow are some ideas and insights on how and why we should promote not just accessibility, but also inclusive tourism that benefits everyone as well as relevant industry resources for tourism businesses and destinations seeking to better understand accessible and inclusive tourism, and to improve their practices. Parts of the content featured here have been inspired by and based on Martin's presentation (originally recorded on July 18th, 2019 as part of the GSTC Sustainable Tourism Training Online Course).\nTourism for All: Including As Many Different Groups As Possible\nContrary to what many might think, accessible tourism is not just about providing facilities that are wheel-chair accessible.\nSenior travelers. Parents traveling with small kids. Travelers with allergies and other medical conditions. These are all different types of travelers who have different degrees of accessibility restrictions and mobility requirements.\nAnd a large proportion of travelers with disabilities have \"invisible\" impairments (such as cognitive or mental health conditions and long-term illnesses) that may not be, unlike wheelchair users, immediately obvious just by looking at them.\nWhen planning for and communicating about the accessibility features and services you provide, therefore, rather than simply using the \"handicap symbol\" (the ubiquitously used sign of a wheelchair user - the top-left pictogram on the above image), these various areas of accessibility needs must be considered and appropriately indicated.\nShare on your website and brochures, for example, if you provide assistive listening devices on your tour, or if sign language interpretation is available within any of the attractions you visit.\n\"Tourism for All\" is a concept that is addressing a growing segment of travelers with a diverse range of needs and requirements. What is \"accessible\" to one traveler who is a wheelchair user, for example, may be very difficult to access or completely inaccessible to another traveler with a different type of disability, mobility impairment or other conditions.\nThat's why becoming more inclusive is a more appropriate goal for the tourism industry than focusing just on \"accessible tourism\" (which can be vague and hard to define - accessible for whom?).\nAn inclusive tourism business or destination works to offer positive travel experiences to people with different needs by addressing them from various perspectives, and by providing design and service solutions that aim to cover as many different groups as possible.\nUniversal Design: Designing for Everyone, Being a Good Host\nWhen it comes to being inclusive and promoting Tourism for All, a key concept that underlies the solutions to be implement by tourism businesses and destinations is Universal Design.\nThe definition of Universal Design is as follows:\nUniversal Design is the design and composition of an environment so that it can be accessed, understood and used to the greatest extent possible by all people regardless of their age, size, ability or disability. An environment (or any building, product, or service in that environment) should be designed to meet the needs of all people who wish to use it. This is not a special requirement, for the benefit of only a minority of the population. It is a fundamental condition of good design. If an environment is accessible, usable, convenient and a pleasure to use, everyone benefits.\n- Centre for Excellence in Universal Design, \" What is Universal Design\nTo understand where you need to improve in order to offer universally accessible experience for everyone's benefit, take some time to reflect on the whole customer journey from the perspectives of guests with different access needs and mobility requirements.\nThink about how they experience travel - from the customer finding your business, to booking their trip, to arriving in your destination, to getting around during their stay.\nAre there steps to enter the restaurant that will make it difficult for customers with limited mobility? Does your hotel offer an accessible and easy-to-follow process for guests with disabilities to check in/out and get around within the property? And is your website designed for users with different needs (e.g. individuals with hearing or vision impairment)?\nBusinesses often have barriers that make it difficult for customers with particular access or mobility impairments to enjoy a certain product or service, because of the lack of awareness that those barriers exist.\nAnd in some cases, businesses may be \"rejecting\" prospective customers without ever knowing. The 2016 Click-Away Pound study found that \"71% of customers with access needs will click away from a website that they find difficult to use\".\nWith all the different types of accessibility requirements, it may seem difficult or impossible to anticipate and accommodate the various needs of your customers. But it's important to remember that in tourism we are in the business of providing services to welcome guests; and that it is in fact your responsibility as a host to cater to the needs of your guests and to make them feel welcome.\nIt's part of being a good host.\nBy considering the diverse needs and abilities of all throughout the design process, universal design creates products, services and environments that meet peoples' needs. Simply put, universal design is good design. - Centre for Excellence in Universal Design, \"What is Universal Design\"\nInclusive Growth and Sustainable Development\nWith the growing importance of the accessible tourism market, and especially the spending power of this market segment including the \"multiplier effect\" (each traveler with impairment is likely to influence the purchase decisions of multiple members of their party), there is a strong economic imperative to be considered. To remain competitive, your tourism business and destination should be investing in universal design and inclusive solutions.\nBeyond the economic imperative, however, there are also key reasons why inclustive tourism should be part of the global sustainable tourism agenda.\nWith an estimated 15% of the world population living with some forms of disabilities (World Health Organization, World Report on Disability 2011), and the changing demographic of the \"rapidly ageing\" populations around the world (WHO, Aging and Life Course), sustainable development can only be achieved through an inclusive approach to creating solutions and opportunities.\nThe United Nations' \"Disability and Development Report: Realizing the Sustainable Development Goals by, for and with persons with disabilities\" (2018) recognizes that \"striving to achieve disability-inclusive development is not only the right thing to do, it is also the practical thing to do,\" as \"the success of the 2030 Agenda requires a participatory and inclusive approach in which all stakeholders, including persons with disabilities, are engaged.\"\nAnd that's why Tourism for All is highlighted in the Global Sustainable Tourism Criteria, the baseline standard for sustainability in travel and tourism.\nSource: Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC)\nAnd in the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO)'s Global Code of Ethics for Tourism.\nSource: UNWTO, Global Code of Ethics for Tourism\nInclusion in the Work Place\nHaving understood the importance of striving for universal design and working towards becoming more inclusive, what can tourism businesses do to get started? What are some of the first steps?\nOne of the key challenges when considering steps to becoming more inclusive is to understand the diverse needs of your customers and your prospective customers. The barriers that prevent some people from having a positive travel experience - whether they may be steps that cannot be climbed, signs that cannot be read, or buttons that cannot be reached - are hard to notice unless you put yourself in the position of those with particular disabilities and impairments.\nOne of the most effective ways for businesses to understand the various accessibility needs of their customers is to have team members who know and represent the perspectives of those customers. In short, hire people with disabilities. Empower them to help make your business more inclusive, both within your operations and through your products and services.\nThe UNWTO report \"Recommendations on Accessible Tourism\" (2013) states that \"the staff of tourism establishments and related services should be prepared to know, understand and address the needs of customers with disabilities\", and \"the staff should include employees who know how to communicate with persons with sensory disabilities.\"\n\"The hospitality industry serves travellers from all over the world. The diversity of cultures implies a diversity of customer expectations as well. The hotels with a diverse workforce to cater to such a wide customer base hold a strong competitive advantage over others. ... [To] have employees that understand the needs and requirements of the customers and provide key insights into making properties progressively accessible is also a crucial element of the overall business strategy.\" - Hospitality Workers Training Centre, \"Disability Inclusion in the Hospitality Industry Makes Business Sense\"\nBusiness Examples: Staff Diversity and Inclusion\nLemon Tree Hotels Limited, India\nWinner of the 2019 Tourism for Tomorrow Awards, in the category \"Investing in People\", Lemon Tree Hotels have focused on creating a socially inclusive work environment, bringing together people of different backgrounds, abilities and ethnicities to work as a unified team with a common goal.

Experiencing a voyage on Tenacious (or her sister ship Lord Nelson) is an object lesson in the benefits of inclusion and accessibility.

This paper intends to advance available knowledge on this issue by conceptually suggesting a solution that draws on the concepts of the tourism experience and digital ecosystems.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020, Fabio Cassia, Paola Castellani, Chiara Rossato and Claudio Baccarani\nPublished by Emerald Publishing Limited.

Tourism experience and tourism ecosystem from perspective of tourists with mobility disability 4.1 Mapping the tourism experience through the tourism customer journey The tourism customer journey (TCJ) involves mapping the entire journey of a tourist, outlining all the stages a person goes through when experiencing the need to move for tourism purposes (\u00c5str\u00f8m, 2020). The TCJ draws on the more general concept of the customer journey, which is the \u201cprocess a customer goes through, across all stages and touch points, that makes up the customer experience\u201d (Lemon and Verhoef, 2016, p. 71). Mapping customer journeys is a popular and effective way to grasp the entire tourism customer experience (Rosenbaum et al., 2017). If the tourism product as a whole was offered by one single company, the general customer journey concept could be easily applied to tourism in the same way as it is applied to other kinds of services (e.g. banking, retail and insurance services). However, as will be discussed shortly, tourism is a more complex service because of the number and variety of co-creating actors and the relationships amongst them. Here, we apply the TCJ to the context of people with mobility disability. A similar analysis could be applied to people with other disabilities (Al\u00e9n et al., 2012), resulting in different and specific types of TCJs. Given the complexity of applying a contextual study to all types of disabilities, this study focusses only on people with mobility disability, but the same method of analysis could be easily extended and replicated. From the very beginning of the TCJ, even when individuals are planning their holiday, they will encounter a series of actors, whose number will dramatically increase in the subsequent stages of the journey (Buhalis, 2000; Saraniemi and Kyl\u00e4nen, 2011). This is because tourism involves a complex ecosystem that has many actors who influence to a greater or lesser extent the experience perceived by individuals during their journey (Gretzel et al., 2016). The quality delivered by each actor clearly influences the overall quality of the tourist's overall experience (Ciasullo, 2017). Sometimes this phenomenon is emphasised because the quality performance of one provider has a spillover effect on the customer's evaluation of the quality performance of other components of (or actors in) the tourism ecosystem (Bourdeau et al., 2007). That is, a negative performance in one part of the journey may have a negative halo effect on the entire journey, considering that the tourist (beyond being the focal actor of the ecosystem) (Storbacka et al., 2016) is the only actor to see all the components of the ecosystem. Similarly, a positive performance in one of the moments of truth (Normann, 2001) has the potential to compensate for a series of negative performances in other parts of the journey. Overall, there is a remarkable risk of tourist dissatisfaction, which is heightened when the person undertaking the journey has some form of disabilities, such as when they have reduced mobility. These arguments can be illustrated through the construction of the TCJ for a holiday that is independently conceived and designed by a person with mobility disability who has time to spend in a destination to be selected and does not want to rely on standardised offerings delivered by tour operators. For this purpose, we draw on the general framework suggested by Baccarani and Cassia (2017), according to which a holiday is articulated and occurs in the following four main stages (Figure 1): destination choice and trip design; outbound trip; staying at the destination; transfer to another destination or return home. Each of the four stages of the TCJ develops through the processes that are outlined below. The points marked with the sign (*) in the following list represent critical aspects for people with mobility disability because they can entail various problems related to accessibility because of the presence of architectural, communication, cultural, technological and relational barriers. The first stage of the TCJ \u2013 destination choice and trip design \u2013 encompasses the formation of a tourist's experiential expectations drawing on the following elements: time available for the journey, motivations triggering the need for the journey, any previous personal holiday experiences, any previous indirect holiday experiences (e.g. information collected online, online reviews and e-word-of-mouth), dialogue and interactions with disability organisations and associations, information available online or printed specialised magazines and publications, information available in promotional materials delivered by tourism destinations, means of transportation available and reservation of such transportation (*), type of accommodations available and reservation of such lodgings (*), definition of a hierarchy of suitable destinations (*). The second stage of the TCJ \u2013 outbound trip \u2013 covers the most complex part of the holiday. In fact, the anticipated benefits of the planned holiday take shape during this stage. In the case that the tourist uses a personally owned means of transport suitable for their disability to reach the boarding point and that the travel is done by aeroplane, this stage includes the following elements: printing the boarding pass, estimating the time that they must leave home to reach the airport (this estimation is informed by customers' sensitivity to risk and the information available), preparing their luggage, planning which road or highways to take to reach the airport, stopping at rest areas to meet their needs or the needs of others or to comply with the requirements of the transport providers (*), parking in an area near the airport (*), checking in their luggage (*), reaching the boarding point (*), complying with any safety control procedures (*), waiting at a boarding gate (*), boarding the aeroplane (*), flying to the destination (*), disembarking and claiming their luggage (*), searching for a local means of transport to reach the accommodation facility (*), arriving and being welcomed at the accommodation facility (*). The third stage of the TCJ \u2013 staying at the destination \u2013 represents the core of the holiday with all that a person desired for their time away on holiday. This is a stage of personal enhancement in relation to seeking knowledge, values and relationships. During this stage, the core value of the holiday emerges and is influenced, at least in the beginning, by the travel experience, which may increase or diminish the initial enthusiasm. This stage encompasses the following points and involves a variety of actors at the destination: planning itineraries, visits and activities that the tourists wish to engage in at the destination based on their previous knowledge and the information available to them, visiting cultural, artistic and natural sites in an area (*), forming relationships with the host community (*), selecting from a variety of foods and eateries on offer (*), participating in local guided tours (e.g. wine tours) (*), using local means of transport (*), purchasing souvenirs. The fourth stage of the TCJ \u2013 transfer to another place or return back home \u2013 is similar to stages two and three described above, and includes the overall evaluation of the perceived quality in relation to the expected quality developed in stage one. In addition to the steps described above, which imply a variety of relationships between the tourist and several different actors, the context of a holiday is even more complex because tourist safety and care must be specifically assured, particularly for PwD. These conditions must be guaranteed by higher-level welfare systems, with which the tourism service network should be able to cooperate effectively. In summary, in this TCJ the tourist benefits from a variety of services that globally support the creation of the tourism experience, which is phenomenologically determined and perceived by the beneficiary (i.e. the tourist) (Vargo and Lusch, 2016). 4.2 Identifying the tourism ecosystem in relation to tourists with mobility disability This subsection identifies the actors that form the complex tourism ecosystem in its co-creation of the tourism experience. During each of the four stages of the TCJ, many different actors contribute to the formation of the overall tourist experience by delivering or not delivering the expected quality. In the tourist's experience, all these actors form a tourism service ecosystem, even if they represent only a set of services that the customer has assembled (Baccarani and Cassia, 2017). In fact, a service ecosystem implies a self-contained, self-adjusting system of resource-integrating actors connected by shared institutional arrangements and mutual value creation (Vargo and Lusch, 2016). However, this level of coordination amongst all the actors involved in the co-creation of tourism experience does not yet exist. Below, we outline the actors involved in each of the four stages of the TCJ. In the first stage, the tourist imagines, designs, plans and anticipates the pleasure of their holiday. To complete this stage, the tourist relies on the information provided by actors such as airlines and accommodation providers and interact with them directly or through intermediaries. For people with mobility disability, the dialogue and interactions with disability organisations and associations play an important role. As highlighted by the UNWTO, disabled peoples' organisations (DPOs) play a key role in accessible tourism because \u201cthey are mediators in understanding specific needs, existent barriers and the ways to bridge them\u201d (UNWTO, 2020). At this first stage of the TCJ (destination choice and trip design), quality is evaluated on the basis of the completeness and clarity of the information provided by multiple actors. All the actors involved in this first stage of the TCJ represent the holiday-design ecosystem (see Figure 3). In the second stage of the TCJ (outbound trip), at least the following 12 actors are involved, and this number could be even higher if a tourist decides to use public means of transport (instead of a personally owned means on transport): producers of publications or websites and intermediaries distributing information that guides the tourist in selecting the destination during the season in which the journey takes place; booking organisations through their websites; transport providers, including those preparing the service timetable; highways operators who have information about roadworks and any related delays; firms executing the roadworks who have information about any interruptions that may affect the roadworks and travel times; firms managing the rest areas and a variety of other services that may be required; firms managing the parking areas who may assist customers to reach their boarding point after having parked their vehicle; airport company that manages the departure airport that offers a welcome service and controls safety processes; airline that is responsible for checking in passengers, assigning boarding gates, flying times and delivering baggage; airport company that manages the arrival airport that offers welcome services and provides information to customers and about local means of transport; local transport service operators; accommodation services providers. Therefore, a tourist interacts with at least 12 different co-creating actors during the second stage of the TCJ. These actors are connected in the tourist's mind but they are practically linked only through market relations and they do not coordinate their decisions and behaviours. Thus, it is unlikely that the tourist will be able to complete the second stage without experiencing some level of difficulty. For example, the tourist may miss the flight because of planned roadwork not being properly notified in advance or because of other unforeseen events. To evaluate the quality of the overall experience, the tourist considers all the components of this stage of the TCJ, comparing expected and actual quality. In particular, the tourist will appreciate the problem-solving capability of the actors. This second group of actors represents the travel ecosystem (see Figure 3). In the third stage of the TCJ (staying at the destination), the tourist stays at the chosen destination where they interact with at least the following actors: firms who manage welcome and accommodation services; restaurateurs; local inhabitants (local community); local transport service operators; local merchants with their value propositions; agencies who organise local tours so that customers can explore local traditions, culture and products; municipalities; organisations protecting tourists' safety and care. This third stage of the TCJ has fewer actors than the second stage. However, the variety of actors is greater because during the tourist's stay at the destination, the tourist will engage in activities such as trying different types of food offerings to appreciate the local food culture, which means they will have contact and engage with more actors. Similarly, to explore local artistic, natural and cultural heritage, the tourist will select from a variety of opportunities that are available at the destination. In the third stage of the TCJ, the local community also plays a fundamental role in welcoming tourists and in co-creating their tourism experiences. In fact, in addition to the technical and functional\u2013relational components of the quality delivered by local services (Gr\u00f6nroos, 1990; Kang and James, 2004), the welcoming atmosphere experienced at the destination plays a central role in the formation of the overall perceived quality (Nunkoo and Ramkissoon, 2011). All the actors involved in the third stage of the TCJ represent the staying at destination ecosystem (see Figure 3). The fourth stage (transfer to another place or return back home) is a replication of the stages two and three outlined above and encompasses the tourist's comparison between the overall perceived quality and the expected quality developed in stage one. The actors that populate the tourism service ecosystem are largely the same for tourists with and without disabilities. However, tourists with disabilities can select amongst a smaller number of offerings than tourists without disabilities. Moreover, actors are required to have adequate technical and relational skills to deliver tourism services to tourists with disabilities. Thus, tourists with disabilities must face greater difficulties in their travel-related choices because of the presence of several types of barriers (see Figure 2). The tourism ecosystem described in this sub-section is depicted in Figure 3. The quality of the tourism experience emerges from the relationships established within this tourism ecosystem through which resources are combined and value is co-created. Such relationships have different degrees of smoothness depending on the presence of several barriers.\n5. Barriers to accessible tourism: can digital ecosystems represent a solution? Drawing on the arguments developed so far, this section identifies in detail the barriers to fulfilling tourism experience co-creation for PwD. The intention of the discussion is to understand whether and how digital ecosystems could represent a viable solution to such barriers. The identified relationships amongst the co-creating actors have not been harmonised to deliver the overall quality desired by the tourist because they are regulated by pure competitive mechanisms, emphasising the value of a specific part of the ecosystem instead of the value of the entire ecosystem. However, in tourism, competition amongst companies of the same sector can exist only once a territory as a whole is attractive. As highlighted in several studies (Baccarani et al., 2019; Barnes, 2004), the territory is not a physical space, but a highly complex viable subject emerging from all co-creations over time through the interactions between nature and human beings. Thus, the territory emerges from the relational synergies between the people who inhabit it and the environment. Therefore, the stronger the synergies established in a certain location, the higher the location's attractiveness and value, which then make the location a platform in which individual actors can compete against each other with their propositions. That is, the long-term attractiveness of a territory and of a tourism destination derives from the actions of the entire ecosystem, within which the actors must aim to do their best through a continuous dialogue with the territorial ecosystem. For this purpose, tourism must be conceived in a holistic manner by deploying planning efforts that involve all the actors of the ecosystem and engage all the potential beneficiaries of the tourism offering \u2013 be they are tourists with or without disabilities (Darcy et al., 2020). This perspective cannot ignore a series of barriers that determine biases in the co-creation of a location that provides tourism services for all tourists and particularly for those with mobility disability. In detail, the following barriers to accessible tourism can be identified (Gillovic et al., 2018; Michopoulou et al., 2020; Nyanjom et al., 2018): informational barriers; architectural barriers; political barriers; cultural barriers; relational barriers; technological barriers; entrepreneurial myopia. These barriers are outlined below from the perspective of PwD. Informational barriers refer to the difficulties that a person with disabilities faces when desiring to autonomously evaluate and choose a means of transport, accommodation, a holiday itinerary or simple holiday activities such as shopping. While there is usually a great deal of information is available for such services, informational needs of PwD leads to higher levels of complexity. For example, even when information about tourism services is available it can difficult to verify. Architectural barriers refer to the obstacles PwD encounter on holiday when engaging in activities such as accessing means of transport, moving in different locations, and using sidewalks and roads. Inconveniences related to architectural barriers can often also be experienced by people without disabilities (e.g. finding it difficult to understand the subway system) but the barriers are emphasised for PwD. Architectural barriers are directly connected to political barriers, which refer to the needs of PwD in the context of a political agenda. While political discourses highlight the ideal of acting to eliminate architectural barriers, political actions are often guided by urgency, short-termism and narrow-sighted electoral benefits. Cultural barriers refer to the indifference that can characterise the behaviour of all people of all abilities (Gillovic et al., 2018) towards PwD. This barrier is manifest in factors such as the lack of respect for PwD parking slots. Relational barriers refer to the general population viewing PwD from a self-righteous perspective, believing that the PwD cannot live a full life, even within the constraints of the experienced impairments. Technological barriers refer to the speed of the technological change related to means of transport and communication, which can create difficult situations for those who do not keep up with the ongoing changes. Entrepreneurial myopia refers to the inability to appreciate the size and value of the tourism market for PwD and of changes occurring in public opinion. This myopia is in tension with the ideals of sustainability provided by Agenda 2030 (United Nations, 2015), which explicitly highlights the need to promote sustainability and inclusivity and to empower PwD (e.g. points 11 and 23 of Agenda 2030) and by the Global Code of Ethics for Tourism (UNWTO, 2001), which states the \u201cright to tourism\u201d (article 7). When accessible tourism experiences are designed, it is important to avoid ad-hoc solutions aimed exclusively at PwD (Scheyvens and Biddulph, 2018). Following the principles of universal design (Michopoulou et al., 2020), tourism providers should in fact enable experiences that are useable by all people, with or without disabilities. This approach is consistent with the idea that tourism carries a value that makes it a public service, interpreted as a service that should be assured for every member of communities that desire such services. The question now arises of the assessment of the potential of digital ecosystems to remove the identified barriers and enable effective accessible tourism experience co-creation. While it is clear that technology cannot solve all the problems, we contend that it represents a valuable engine for such effective co-creation. As noted by Akaka and Vargo (2014), technology should be conceived as an operant resource able to bring about changes in ecosystems and influence value co-creation processes. The provision of a platform to support the engagement of actors involved in accessible tourism can thus represent a first step to first removing informational and relational barriers, and over time, smoothening other barriers (e.g. cultural barriers). Thus, technology can enable the emergence of a digital ecosystem with tourists and their needs as the focal actors (Gretzel et al., 2015, 2016). Such an ecosystem could initially organise and coordinate suitable solutions to emerging PwD needs and issues by collecting and sharing the information concerning all the actors of the ecosystem. Given that tourism is a service provided by a specific territory, the digital ecosystem should be led by the authorities in charge at the territorial level, whether a municipality, province, region or country. Given that the emerging ecosystems require rapid efficiency and effectiveness checks, it seems more appropriate that the process begins at the local territorial level and then extended (through imitation and adaptations) to higher levels. Beyond authorities in charge at the territorial level, universities and other research institutes should play a central role in the design of a tourism ecosystem. These institutions should establish a dialogue with tourists, with PwD and with disability organisations and associations, without overlooking local inhabitants who are important for creating a warm and smooth welcoming. The emergence of the tourism ecosystem also draws on the constructive contributions of all the organisations representing the service providers who play a role in co-creating tourism experiences. The digital ecosystem should also be based on a series of incentives for firms that decide to be a part of the ecosystem, beyond a process of certification and evaluation of their delivered quality. As a good starting point, municipalities could establish tourism departments that have the additional responsibility for the removal of mobility barriers. The viability of this choice is demonstrated by the experience of Verona, the first (and currently the only) municipality in Italy that has introduced such a department. For smaller municipalities, the digital ecosystem could be created at a higher level, such as in a consortium of municipalities, a province or a region. Figure 2 presents the main features of the tourism digital ecosystem. Overall, the establishment of a digital ecosystem aims to make the territory an inclusive, warm and welcoming location where people want to live or stay. Hence, by providing an engagement platform, technology can act as an operant resource, disrupting the myopia guiding each actor's individual behaviours. An example of a digital ecosystem to support accessible tourism is the one being implemented by Explora, the destination management organisation of the Lombardy region (Italy). Explora has begun to establish a digital ecosystem (Ecosistema Digitale Turistico della Lombardia) through a platform that aims to support information sharing amongst the actors of Lombardy's tourism ecosystem. This ecosystem has not been created specifically to support accessible tourism. However, through this platform, operators could coordinate and harmonise the design of accessible tourism experiences, which would then be communicated and sold through the related web portal \u201cin-lombardia.it\u201d. This web portal currently hosts dozens of accessible tourism experiences; however, these are not conceived following the concept of the holistic ecosystem described in this paper. Nonetheless, the technological infrastructure that has been created has the ability to foster the future emergence of such a holistic accessible tourism ecosystem."}, {"title": "The Concepts of Design for All and Universal Design", "article": null}, {"title": "UNWTO, ONCE Foundation and ENAT - Delivering Accessible Tourism for All", "article": "UNWTO, ONCE Foundation and ENAT - Delivering Accessible Tourism for All\nThe World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) will continue to build on its successful partnership with the Spanish ONCE Foundation and the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT). The three parties have agreed to extend their partnership agreement for a further four years to ensure that their work to improve accessibility, in every part of the tourism value chain, continues during and beyond the pandemic.\nThe joint work will continue to focus on the promotion of good practices during the current crisis, the application of standards, the measurement of accessible tourism, as well as labour inclusion and institutional disability inclusive policies. The three partners are currently collecting success stories of destinations and companies which have adopted new sanitary protocols to facilitate access to travel and tourism for all, including both residents and visitors. In line with the key UNWTO Recommendations released early on during the pandemic, the Accessibility Champions initiative is still open for submissions illustrating how the guidelines to restart tourism without imposing new obstacles are being successfully implemented. The most outstanding cases will be promoted by the partners through an e-publication and webinars.\nThe three partners are also committed to raising awareness of the forthcoming ISO Standard on Tourism for All. All three have worked with the International Standardization Organization (ISO) on the new requirements and recommendations. The ISO standard will represent a milestone, being the first global standard aimed at implementing and improving accessibility throughout the tourism value chain.\nThe awareness-raising work will sensitize institutions, governments and service providers o the importance of accessibility for all and inclusion. It will make clear that this is not only a question of human rights and equal opportunities, but also a major competitive advantage for destinations and the private sector.\nUNWTO, the ONCE Foundation and ENAT jointly state: \u201cAccessibility for all is about service quality, innovation and comfort for all tourists, new sources of revenue and new clients with disabilities, seniors and families with young children, among many other individuals, with specific access requirements. By adopting Universal Design principles in the development of environments and services, the tourism sector can fulfil its moral responsibility and, in many countries, legal obligations to cater to those with specific requirements, making tourism for all a reality.\u201d\nRelated Links"}, {"title": "Accessibility and Inclusive Tourism Development: Current State and Future Agenda", "article": "Considered as both an analytical concept as well as an aspirational ideal, inclusive tourism development \u201ccan be used to evaluate current tourism practices to help detect where changes are needed, as well as to guide new tourism development\u201d [ 2 ] (p. 587). Accessibility constitutes one important consideration in the field of scholarship relating to inclusive tourism development in the drive for innovation and new recommendations to counter socio-economic barriers and exclusions. Whilst the seven elements of inclusive tourism development thus form an appropriate and useful framework upon which to map the current state of play of accessible tourism scholarship so as to propose a future agenda, as is proffered in this paper, it does not provide a means for recommending specific initiatives to combat the social barriers imposed by the tourism industry.\nTourism scholars continue to question how the tourism industry and tourism research might drive a more inclusive and sustainable future. This is certainly the case with respect to reducing the current marginalisation or exclusion of people with disabilities in tourism by bringing them into the industry in ways that directly benefit them, or that they can gain more control over [ 1 ]. As tourism has long been positioned by scholars as exclusionary, there is a continued need to address the industry\u2019s lack of accessibility that creates social inequality [ 2 ]. With this purpose in mind, the aim of this conceptual paper is to map how accessible tourism is currently positioned against the framework of inclusive tourism development and to give examples of relevant accessible tourism studies to recommend a future agenda for more inclusive outcomes that move towards sustainability.\nThis paper thereby puts forth the view that the conceptual framework for inclusive tourism development, as an analytical tool, is complementary to considering the scope of work on accessible tourism and we advocate its use for examining the current state of accessible tourism. In this way, the degree to which accessible tourism development is inclusive may be determined by an assessment of the seven elements of the framework. As such, we now apply the framework of inclusive tourism development to conceptually map the current position of accessible tourism and give examples of relevant accessible tourism studies to recommend a future agenda. That is, we seek to examine \u201cthe tourism industry as it currently is, and also what it could be\u201d [ 51 ] (p. 859).\nUltimately, Scheyvens and Biddulph attest that these seven elements may be applied to evaluate the degree to which tourism development is inclusive [ 2 ]. Our intention here is not to critique the established framework but rather to apply it to guide our own evaluation of tourism in terms of its accessibility for people with disabilities so as to shed light on a future agenda for accessible tourism in the broader context of sustainability. Scheyvens and Biddulph [ 2 ] posit that accessible tourism is just one aspect of inclusive tourism as the latter more broadly considers all forms of social and economic exclusion and division, not just accessibility. It could be argued, however, that such broad scoping does not sufficiently grant attention to specific excluded or marginalised groups. While Darcy et al. have commended Biddulph and Scheyvens\u2019 [ 26 ] definition of inclusive tourism for encompassing \u201call forms of marginality and intersectionality,\u201d they argue that it is too broadly focused and not specific enough to people with disabilities [ 1 ] (p. 141).\nIn defining the concept of inclusive tourism, Scheyvens and Biddulph put forward seven different elements of inclusive tourism development which they argue constitute lines of inquiry in investigations of tourism\u2019s inclusiveness [ 2 ]. Discussion of these elements can also inform a consideration of the potentials and limitations for tourism to generate wider socio-economic impacts for more equitable and sustainable outcomes. The first element, marginalised people as tourism producers, is about \u201covercoming barriers to disadvantaged groups\u2019 access to tourism as producers.\u201d The second element, marginalised people as tourism consumers, is about \u201covercoming barriers to disadvantaged groups\u2019 access to tourism consumers.\u201d The third element, self-representation in dignified and appropriate ways, is about telling the stories, and representing the culture, of marginalised people in meaningful ways. The fourth element, power relations challenged in and beyond tourism, is about \u201cchallenging dominant power relations.\u201d The fifth element, the widening of participation in tourism decision-making, is about \u201cwho can contribute to the decision-making about development of tourism.\u201d The sixth element, changing the tourism map to involve new people and places, is about \u201cproviding opportunities for new places to be on the tourism map.\u201d The seventh element, promotion of mutual understanding and respect, is about \u201cencouraging learning, exchange and mutually beneficial relationships which promote understanding and respect between \u2018hosts\u2019 and \u2018guests\u2019\u201d [ 2 ] (p. 593).\nCritical tourism scholars have increasingly explored the perspectives of such overlooked populations whose voices are underrepresented and marginalised [ 45 46 ], the common denominator being the subjugation and exclusion of the \u2018other\u2019 [ 47 48 ]. Understood as a hopeful, critical and moral turn, this inquiry is oriented toward advocacy and a more inclusive view of tourism that promotes human rights and social justice within the industry and inquiry related to it [ 46 50 ]. By acknowledging past non-participation and exclusion in tourism, we can consider ways to enable future participation and inclusion in authentic and meaningful ways. In this way, inclusive tourism \u201ccan add value to tourism knowledge and understandings by seeking to explicitly overcome the exclusionary tendencies of tourism and to ensure that a wider range of people participate in and benefit from tourism endeavours\u201d [ 2 ] (p. 590). As such, it is thought to be a transformative form of tourism; transformative in \u201caddressing inequality, overcoming the separation of different groups living in different places, challenging stereotypes or generalised histories, and opening people up to understanding the situation of minorities\u201d [ 2 ] (p. 592).\nInclusive tourism is an analytical concept and an aspirational ideal [ 2 ]. Typically perceived from a domineering neoliberal perspective, tourism development has been pursued by governments and operators alike for its economic outcomes [ 36 38 ] and, today, comprises one of the world\u2019s largest and growing industries [ 39 40 ]. However, \u201cas tourism expands at a seemingly insatiable pace, the inequalities become increasingly evident and so too does the need for more complex and nuanced understandings of them\u201d [ 41 ] (p. xv). To this end, it has been argued that tourism\u2019s \u201cfull potential is squandered and its promise of many powerful benefits for humanity remains unfulfilled\u201d [ 17 ] (p. 1193). Indeed, tourism has long been critiqued for its exclusive nature. Tourism scholarship, too, has been remiss in its lack of inclusion of certain individuals and groups at the margins of society [ 42 43 ]. Those who are \u201cothered, omitted, overlooked or ostracised\u201d in and from tourism are individuals and groups marginalised as a result of various identity markers and their intersectional nature [ 1 ] (p. 140). Therefore, in viewing tourism through a lens of social justice, we can read tourism \u201cas an assertion of power and privilege\u201d and must give greater thought to how we might ratify the right to tourism [ 44 ] (p. 1927).\nParticipation in tourism is fundamental to enjoying all that citizenship represents. As such, tourism scholars have increasingly been concerned with the participation and inclusion of people with disabilities [ 31 ]. Scholars have come some way in addressing disability in tourism [ 13 ]. The concept of accessible tourism \u201cenables people with access requirements, including mobility, vision, hearing and cognitive dimensions of access, to function independently and with equity and dignity through the delivery of universally designed tourism products, services and environments\u201d [ 10 ] (p. 34). While the accessible tourism agenda, undoubtedly, has evolved in its sophistication [ 1 ], it has been somewhat devoid of an inclusive agenda.\nLike sustainability [ 25 ], accessibility is a contemporary tourism issue [ 13 ]. In its broadest sense, accessibility ensures the development of products, services and environments that allow everyone to use and derive benefit from them. An example is that of universal design principles, which enable usability by people with disabilities without the need for adaptation. It is important to consider where disability and tourism fit within the broader sustainability agenda, as well as the need for accessibility and inclusion in tourism [ 26 ]. People with disabilities are a historically excluded and socially marginalised group that lack power and voice [ 27 ]. They have faced, and continue to face, barriers to their full and effective participation and inclusion in the community and in cultural life, whether that be the arts, sport and recreation [ 1 28 ]. While tourism is considered an integral part of modern life, for people with disabilities, it is not always accessible or inclusive [ 29 30 ]. People with disabilities are not always able to partake in this leisure activity due to its barrier-laden and socially exclusive nature [ 6 31 ]. That said, tourism has the potential to enhance the quality of life and life satisfaction for people with disabilities, through the likes of personal development and social interaction [ 32 33 ]. Such benefits and outcomes should be a priority with regard to a population who are denied all sorts of different opportunities in their day-to-day lives [ 34 35 ].\nDespite attention to the Sustainable Development Goals, some individuals and groups, because of their gender, age, ethnicity, poverty, sexuality or disability [ 24 ], lack power and/or voice, and are excluded from development [ 2 ]. Central to the Sustainable Development Goals is the principle of inclusion, and development, therefore, will be inclusive only when said individuals and groups are empowered and have their voices heard. We cannot ignore disability and, especially, the perspectives and experiences of people with disabilities, when addressing the Sustainable Development Goals in tourism [ 1 5 ].\nThe United Nations (2006) Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recognises the citizenship rights of people with disabilities, and is underpinned by principles of respect and equality, access and inclusion [ 18 ]. Of particular relevance to this paper is the citizenship right to travel [ 10 20 ]. Specifically, Article 9 refers to access to transportation and the built environment, and Article 30 refers to participation in all areas of \u2018cultural life,\u2019 including sport, leisure and tourism [ 21 ]. Ratified in 2015, the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals provide a framework for balancing the economic, environmental and social dimensions of sustainable development [ 22 ]. The purpose of that framework is to foster equitable and inclusive societies, where respect for human rights and human dignity, as well as equal opportunities, are realised [ 22 ]. To this end, the Agenda and Goals are guided by the purpose and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and reaffirm the importance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities [ 23 ]. Embedded within these Goals are considerations pertaining to disability.\nThe tourism industry and tourism scholarship have long advocated for the sustainable development of tourism. Sustainable development seeks to balance the protection of the environment, the promotion of economic growth, and the maintenance of social and cultural integrity, both in the present and in the future [ 15 ]. Much of this attention has been directed toward the economic and environmental sustainability of the industry. Less of this attention has been directed toward issues of social sustainability, and especially neglected are considerations of the implications of ageing and disability which undoubtedly present challenges for the future of tourism [ 5 16 ]. Notwithstanding the importance of economic growth and environmental responsibility, a broader sense of human dignity, respect and welfare [ 2 17 ] means there is a need to more fully consider the wider social benefits of tourism.\nWhile the statistics provide a measure of disability, disability discourse can better guide our understanding. The medical and social models of disability have informed much of the previous disability discourse [ 6 ]. The medical model of disability provided a perspective of disability that emphasised the impairment before the individual, and perpetuated notions of abnormality or loss in functional ability. As such, it prioritised the need for a treatment or cure, intervention or accommodation. In contrast, the social model of disability has challenged the previous medical discourse. Instead, it argues that it is society that disables the individual rather than their impairment, and thereby requires a social solution to reduce barriers and enable participation. A contemporary perspective of disability acknowledges, understands and celebrates the diversity and multiplicity of disability [ 8 ]. Disability is likely to be a feature of most people\u2019s lifespans, whether in a temporary or permanent capacity; and whether it affects people directly, or indirectly through someone close to them [ 10 12 ]. The inevitability of these socio-demographic shifts will present a range of future implications for our global society, and by extension, tourism [ 10 13 ]. Scholars have recognised this correlation between ageing, disability and tourism, and what this means, and will mean, for tourists and residents alike [ 5 14 ]. Notably, \u201cstudies on disability and tourism broaden the diversity of a field by including 10\u201320 percent of the population who had previously been excluded from our understanding\u201d [ 1 ] (p. 142).\nDisability is ubiquitous worldwide [ 3 ]. It is generally accepted that 15 percent of the global population, or 1 billion people, live with disability. The number of people who are directly or indirectly affected by disability rises to 30 percent of the global population, or 2 billion people, when the family members and carers of people with intellectual disabilities are considered [ 4 ]. In Western developed nations, it is generally accepted that 15 to 20 percent of the population live with disability, and disability is even more prevalent among less developed, vulnerable populations [ 5 6 ]. It is estimated that by the year 2050, the number of people living with disability globally will have risen to 1.2 billion [ 4 ]. This rise will be attributable to population ageing [ 7 ], the rise of chronic health problems and non-communicable diseases [ 8 ], increasing life expectancies, decreasing rates of child mortality [ 9 ], and better tools for identifying and measuring disability [ 4 ].\nIn this paper we use a conceptual approach to explore the degree to which accessible tourism development is inclusive, as determined by an assessment of the seven elements of the conceptual framework by Scheyvens and Biddulph (2018). To achieve this, we drew upon relevant examples from the published literature on accessible tourism to illustrate how it could apply to each of the seven elements of the framework. We considered where the most notable gaps existed in relation to our interpretation of the elements of the framework. These gaps then informed our discussion of a future research agenda for accessible tourism. Noting that the examples we used could apply across more than one of the seven elements, we recognise the plurality and potential for differing interpretations on our findings. We also recognise that the inclusive tourism development framework, as an analytical tool, was designed by Scheyvens and Biddulph (2018) with a broader agenda for inclusive tourism beyond just accessibility. Whilst our discussion here is only a snapshot of how the framework can be applied to the accessible tourism agenda, we recommend that future researchers may wish to provide a more systematic review of the literature to critique the applicability of the framework for future considerations of accessible tourism and sustainability.\nThere is evidence that tourism promotional materials perpetuate an ableist gaze [ 110 ]. To counter the lack of understanding of disability, previous studies have emphasised the need for increased awareness and knowledge of disability [ 68 88 ]. They have reported on the value in breaking down the negative attitudinal barriers people with disabilities encounter from others. Examples have included the normalising of disability through better representation of people with disabilities, for instance, in packaging and promotion or through media [ 66 ]. Examples have also included: the employment of more enabling language [ 111 ], considering more accessible web design and assistive technologies [ 112 ], and carrying out disability awareness raising and sensitivity training programmes [ 76 ]. The transformative potential of accessible tourism requires the continued challenging of stereotypes and stigma, and the ongoing promotion of awareness, acceptance and inclusion. Inclusive attitudes and approaches are integral to the provision of accessibility [ 35 72 ] to ensure people with disabilities are treated equitably, and with dignity and respect [ 6 10 ].\nIn addition to universal design as a strategy for more inclusive tourism, it has been suggested that social tourism policy and practice has the potential to contribute to inclusive and sustainable outcomes for people with disabilities [ 20 94 ]. Other examples of such socially-based tourism policies and practices include prospects like respite tourism [ 108 ] or assisted vacations [ 109 ]. That said, people with disabilities access tourism outside of social policies, and such policies are not offered in some countries; hence, future considerations must be directed at development of policies and an inclusive tourism system for all.\n\u201cEnsuring access to travel and tourism opportunities for people living with disability as well as for the entire population requires knowledge and design structures that are inclusive for all citizens\u201d [ 100 ] (p. 46). The incorporation of physical accessibility into existing and potential tourism sites and spaces has become increasingly significant, and Darcy et al. [ 5 ] have suggested that it is no longer realistic, feasible or ethical to ignore such demands [ 5 ]. Not only are various components of the tourism system largely inaccessible, but people with disabilities can face difficulty in negotiating the built environment too [ 104 ], which impedes upon their participation and \u201creduces their independence, dignity, equity and self-determination\u201d [ 18 ] (p. 183). A concept central to understanding accessible tourism development is universal design. The principles of universal design distinctively provide positive economic benefits to operators and destinations alike, and socially sustainable outcomes to people with disabilities and wider society, given that it recognises the implications of ageing and disability, and adopts a whole-of-life approach [ 5 ].\nAt the destination level, it is both complex and challenging to deliver quality accessible tourism experiences due to the fragmented nature of the industry and lack of collaboration between the tourism and access sectors [ 104 ]. Accessibility, at the destination level, then, determines whether, and to what extent, an individual can participate in tourism [ 29 107 ]. It is not enough for a single component of the journey to be accessible, if the other components are largely inaccessible. \u201cUntil examples of good business practice are identified and promoted, the industry cannot be guided with certainty about the benefits in providing expanded accessible tourism products\u201d [ 5 ] (p. 533). Some destinations, namely Europe, the United States and Australia, are conforming to legislative requirements and proactively \u201cdeveloping infrastructure, goods, services, marketing and promotion in alignment with the collaborative processes outlined in the conceptualisation of accessible tourism\u201d [ 1 ] (p. 142).\nWithin the literature, much has been written that relates, in part, to changing the tourism map to involve new people and places. This includes considerations of the tourism system at large, in terms of destination management, to the incorporation of the principles of universal design in tourism sites and spaces. It also includes considerations of both the business and social rationales for accessible tourism, and its role in achieving sustainability.\nSeveral studies have reported on the significance of multiple and diverse stakeholder perspectives, participation and collaboration in the development of accessible tourism. Michopoulou and Buhalis [ 105 ] offer a comprehensive analysis of accessible tourism stakeholders. Given that people with disabilities themselves have the lived experience of disability and the requirement of various access needs and support, it is especially pertinent that their voices are heard [ 18 75 ]. In practice, however, this stakeholder group is thought to have limited opportunities to contribute to tourism policy, planning and development in a meaningful way. Therefore, \u201ccollaborative efforts can be enhanced in the development of accessible tourism to innovatively move the agenda towards inclusive tourism\u201d [ 104 ] (p. 676). This also requires future attention to be focused on the consideration of co-creative stakeholder engagement methods to engender collaborative dialogue, equitable inclusion, reciprocal learning and the challenging of existing knowledge gaps and assumptions held by powerful tourism stakeholders [ 106 ].\nThe fifth element of inclusive tourism development is about widening the participation of marginalised people\u2014in this case, people with disabilities\u2014in tourism decision-making. The intention is to better, and more responsibly, reflect certain interests of the community, as well as wider society, in aspects that directly concern them [ 2 ], such as, for instance, in access to transport to access the tourism system [ 103 104 ]. To this end, it is about counteracting the typically dominant industry-centric perspectives by facilitating favourable terms and inclusive approaches that allow for the active participation of people with disabilities in planning and development [ 2 ].\nDaruwalla and Darcy [ 6 ] have cautioned that such disengagement and discrimination is psychological, and there thus remains a future need to measure and analyse existing attitudinal barriers as well as the potential for wider attitudinal change [ 6 ]. Viewing disability as a social construct \u201cprovides the context for understanding the relationship between the individual\u2019s lived experience, society\u2019s attitudes and the focus on creating environments that enable independent, equitable and dignified participation\u201d [ 82 ] (p. 2). Aitchison [ 99 ] has suggested that the existing exclusionary practice of the industry emulates the exclusionary nature of society itself. Indeed, because disability is socially constructed, it necessitates a social solution, and social action [ 13 ].\nTourism does not occur in a \u2018social vacuum\u2019 [ 101 ]. The social restrictions that people with disabilities face every day [ 102 ] are still imposed upon them, and potentially internalised, when travelling [ 97 98 ]. People with disabilities are subjected to a sometimes judgmental, disapproving, and invalidating gaze of others\u2014whether industry personnel, other tourists, or the host community\u2014and to their negative attitudes and social stigma [ 6 100 ]). \u201cNegative attitudes focus on negative behaviours, such as avoidance of people with disabilities, and apathetic behaviour in which people behave as if individuals with disabilities do not exist\u201d [ 76 ] (p. 165). People with disabilities are \u201cleft out, left behind, excluded, waiting, passive, disenfranchised, less than, stigmatised, put down, unable, diminished, powerless, discriminated against\u201d [ 71 ] (p. 195). Industry personnel, for instance, are often described as being apathetic and ignorant, insensitive and lacking empathy [ 68 70 ]. In this way, tourism environments can be sites of marginalisation and inequality. Yet, they can also serve as sites of resistance and/or transformation for people with disabilities, by way of normalising and/or challenging the presence of disability [ 46 97 ]. It is ultimately the attitudes of others that determine whether the tourism experience is positive or negative for people with disabilities [ 80 85 ].\nMitigating barriers to participation and improving accessibility, \u201cis in the broadest sense, an attack on the legal, political, social and economic structures that underpin and perpetuate their existence\u201d [ 6 ] (p. 553). To this end, scholars have highlighted the importance of viewing disability as a social construct [ 13 ]. It is not the individual\u2019s impairment which is disabling, rather it is the complex interactions of the environment and society which denies their participation and inclusion [ 13 92 ].\nA key theme in the literature is the issue of tourism (non-)participation. There is a common misconception that people with disabilities cannot or do not travel [ 69 96 ]. As seen in the previous section, tourism is designed with the mobile and functional in mind [ 99 ] and, in this way, marginalises \u201cthose with different bodies and/or minds\u201d [ 43 ] (p. 1262). Because of this, people with disabilities subsequently negotiate, or even surrender, their participation in tourism [ 35 ]. Accessible tourism is about advocating the right to travel and, therefore, necessitates the removal of barriers that otherwise prevent or constrain participation [ 96 ]. Taking a supply-side perspective, studies largely focus on the barriers, constraints and managerial implications of access-related issues [ 18 100 ]. Barriers, for instance, are typically environmental, intrinsic or interactive in nature [ 31 ], and examples include the likes of a lack of physical access, inaccurate or inadequate information, negative attitudes and discrimination [ 71 91 ]. Some barriers can be negotiated, but not all, as they rely on a complex interplay that is intrinsic to the individual and interactive with the socially constructed tourism environment [ 80 84 ].\nWell-reported in the literature are the positive outcomes people with disabilities derive from partaking in tourism [ 94 95 ]. Tourism affords a number of intra- and interpersonal benefits, whether that be for psychological or physical health, for self-confidence and self-development, or for social interaction and inclusion [ 35 88 ]. Most notably, a sense of quality of life and life satisfaction are asserted through tourism [ 76 92 ]. Tourism can represent a \u2018normal\u2019 or ordinary life for people with disabilities, presenting the potential to exert a sense of independence and autonomy [ 82 92 ]. Tourism, uniquely, provides a setting where people with disabilities may be relieved of the typical \u2018role\u2019 they experience in their everyday life, where they are, or at least are perceived as, objects of care, and by contrast are \u201covercoming self-doubt, redefining [themselves] and building self-confidence\u201d [ 96 ] (p. 87). In fact, scholars have suggested that \u201ctourism represents a metaphor for recovery\u201d [ 35 ] (p. 958), and it can be a site of resistance and/or transformation [ 97 ]. Conversely, tourism can perpetuate anxiety and uncertainty in an overly stimulating and unfamiliar tourism environment [ 70 86 ]. Furthermore, people with disabilities experience disembodiment [ 91 ] and stigma [ 82 98 ]. Recognising the benefits of tourism for people with disabilities and their carers/travel companions, and the social barriers imposed by the tourism industry and wider social stigma, there is a future need to examine the social and relational nature of tourism, and shift focus from a medical to social view of disability [ 81 ].\nTo this end, a growing number of studies have explored the perspectives and experiences of people with different dimensions of disability. Mostly, such studies have focused on people with physical disabilities, or mobility impairments [ 69 87 ], or people with sensory disabilities, and particularly those with vision impairments [ 70 85 ]. The agenda is not necessarily inclusive of different impairment types [ 74 ]. Increasingly, however, other dimensions of disability are being explored, for instance, psychological or psychiatric impairments, such as people with dementia [ 88 ] or people with intellectual disabilities [ 89 ]. Interestingly, notions of ability versus disability are ableist and assume independence [ 82 ]. Yet travel is not always independent, and some people with disabilities are in a situation of dependency, wherein they will travel with a companion or carer [ 89 90 ]. In addition, recognition is being granted to the relational dimension of travel, where studies are including carers, family members and companions of people with disabilities [ 91 92 ]. All of these perspectives \u201cought to be heard if the aim of scholarly inquiry is to conceptualise the tourist experience more comprehensibly and responsibly\u201d [ 93 ] (p. 93).\nA number of tourism scholars have suggested that disability is largely treated as a single- rather than multi-dimensional construct, and people with disabilities as a homogenous rather than heterogenous group [ 6 83 ]. If tourism is to be accessible and inclusive, then a recognition of the diversity of disability, and an individual\u2019s embodiment of that, is key [ 13 ]. Each individual\u2019s dimension of disability, level of support needs and requirement for assistive technologies, in addition to their interaction with the tourism environment, will ultimately shape the experience they derive [ 5 80 ]. There has thus been a shift toward better understanding the embodied ontologies of people with disabilities [ 84 85 ]. This is founded on the recognition that, for people with disabilities, tourism is a multi-sensory, bodily experience where, for the non-disabled, it is predominantly visual [ 48 86 ].\nIndeed, many studies have attested to the economic outcomes that can accrue to businesses and industry alike when accessibility is provided for [ 5 76 ]. Accessibility contributes to tourism activity and occupancy, increases the customer base and market share, reduces effects of seasonality, exploits competitive advantages, improves profitability, and enhances destination competitiveness [ 5 79 ]. Clearly, there is much evidence to suggest this is a significant and potentially lucrative market moving forward [ 73 80 ], despite the fact that there is a limited number of industry-based case studies to showcase such benefits [ 13 ]. Evidence shows that people with disabilities do engage in independent travel and there is a greater need to hear about their needs and experiences as consumers. With regard to accessibility, there is a future need to consider the personalisation of tourism supply [ 81 ], necessitating a greater understanding of the motives, decision-making behaviour, needs and experiences of people with disabilities as tourism consumers.\nIt is widely agreed that the industry, for the most part, has failed to interact with issues pertaining to the access to, and participation in, tourism by people with disabilities\u2019 [ 69 71 ]. People with disabilities are somewhat misunderstood, largely under-served, and even ignored, as a group of consumers, and as a viable segment of the market [ 30 73 ]. Operators do the bare minimum to meet legislative requirements [ 74 ], and governments are largely reactive rather than proactive [ 75 ]. Within the industry, a pervasive assumption is that people with disabilities constitute a minority market that requires considerable investment for low return and profitability [ 43 67 ]. Operators tend to want tangible proof of the benefits this market can bring before committing to providing or improving accessibility [ 5 76 ]. As such, the economic rationale supporting the provision or improvement of accessibility is the driver for operators and industry alike [ 72 77 ]. People with disabilities should be viewed as both \u201cmarket segment\u201d [ 1 ] (p. 142), and as \u201cpart of every market segment\u201d [ 78 ] (p. 222).\nThe second element of inclusive tourism development considers how different groups of people\u2014in this case, people with disabilities\u2014can be engaged in tourism as consumers [ 2 ]. It is this focus on extending access to, and participation in, tourism, beyond the major markets, that serves as a key similarity between inclusive tourism and accessible tourism. Certainly, much of the accessible tourism literature has centred upon people with disabilities as tourism consumers, from both demand- and supply-side perspectives. It is oriented toward an economic or market perspective [ 67 68 ], and how accessibility can be viewed as part of triple bottom line sustainability [ 5 ].\nWhile the studies mentioned above have focused on the employment of people with disabilities in the hospitality sector, there is no reason to suggest that similar studies could not be undertaken in the tourism sector. However, \u201cone of the biggest challenges for inclusive tourism is to encourage responsible production of tourism by existing tourism businesses\u201d [ 2 ] (p. 598). In any event, there is little evidence to suggest that people with disabilities are engaged in tourism as producers, whether that be as employees, or in the capacity of owners, entrepreneurs or regulators. The studies that do exist attest to the continued social barriers for people with disabilities as producers, compounded by the attitudes of employers in the industry as well as industry notions of service training, delivery and professionalism [ 66 ]. What becomes clear, then, is that greater future attention should be directed to engaging people with disabilities as tourism producers.\nFewer studies have examined hospitality organisations that operate as social enterprises and provide employment opportunities to people with disabilities [ 64 ]. The social innovation, \u2018Brownies & Downies,\u2019 for instance, was born from a desire to see more people with disabilities playing a part in the hospitality sector, and by extension, wider society. The coffee shop concept, which began in the Netherlands and has now expanded throughout Europe and to South Africa, involves training centres, placement providers and coffee shops where people with intellectual disabilities are engaged in the preparation and serving of coffee and food [ 65 ].\nThe first element of inclusive tourism development considers how different groups of people\u2014in this case, people with disabilities\u2014can be engaged in tourism as producers, that is, in \u201croles as owners, entrepreneurs, employees and regulators\u201d [ 2 ] (p. 598). Generally speaking, people with disabilities have limited access to, and participation in, the labour market, and there is a lack of accessible workplaces with reasonable accommodations in place [ 23 ]. In tourism, too, there is minimal evidence, anecdotal or otherwise, to suggest that people with disabilities are engaged as producers to any great extent. The studies that do exist are overwhelmingly focused on people with disabilities as employees, principally within the hospitality sector and mostly in hotels. For instance, some studies have considered the barriers to, and challenges in, employing people with disabilities in hotels [ 52 ], or the benefits to, and outcomes for, hospitality organisations that employ people with disabilities [ 53 55 ]. Human resource policies and practices in hotels that employ people with disabilities have also been considered [ 56 58 ], as well as employer perspectives on employing people with disabilities in hospitality organisations [ 59 61 ]. Guest and consumer perspectives on people with disabilities as employees in hotels and restaurants are less studied [ 62 63 ].\n5. Conclusions\nInclusive tourism development is framed as having the potential for a \u201cbroader transformative influence within and beyond the tourism industry\u201d [ 2 ] (p. 584). There is benefit, therefore, in applying the conceptual framework for inclusive tourism development to accessible tourism, because it is fundamentally about the inclusion of people with disabilities in tourism, and in society. Scheyvens and Biddulph [ 2 ] emphasised the importance in confronting constraints to achieving inclusive tourism, arguing that \u201cthe prevailing ideology of neoliberalism\u201d is the greatest of constraints [ 2 ] (p. 603). This paper used a conceptual approach to recommend a future agenda for more inclusive tourism outcomes that move towards sustainability. In mapping how accessible tourism is currently positioned against the seven elements of inclusive tourism development, we have seen that with regard to disability, the predominant constraint to achieving inclusive tourism is arguably the dominant ableist discourse that \u201creproduce[s] and reinforce[s] the dominant hegemony and cultural discourse that currently exist[s] around disability\u201d [ 89 ] (p. 237). As such, a future agenda posits attention to all seven elements of the inclusive tourism framework for accessible tourism. In order to achieve this, we urge researchers to consider three wider considerations. We would caution, however, that Western and Eastern perspectives, as well as developed and developing contexts, may likely reveal differences among these issues. Equally, a more systematic review of the content of previous accessible tourism literature and that of wider fields, may reveal differing perspectives not captured in the notable examples we mention here.\n70, First, we suggest that a closer examination of the wider disability discourse, including both historical and social perspectives of people with disabilities, is an important starting point for accessible tourism scholarship. \u201cBenefits can accrue if the recognition, understanding and knowledge about the long history of marginalisation and exclusion of this group are taken into account\u201d [ 104 ] (p. 678). As individuals and as a collective, we need to recognise our biases, as well as our complicity in accepting, and even perpetuating, the hegemonic hold of ableism [ 113 114 ]. Importantly, if disability is indeed a social construct [ 115 ], then a social solution can be achieved in and through tourism [ 13 82 ]. A future agenda must consider this, further leveraging the social model of disability\nSecond, a future agenda must consider how our academic inquiry can be more participatory and inclusive. If we are to build a sound foundation of knowledge for sustainability, then we need to step outside of our own field and engage with the relevant, related scholarship of other fields, like disability and leisure studies. We need to critically reflect on the consequences of our academic language, and the methods and approaches we adopt for inclusion, equity of participation, collaborative dialogue, reciprocal learning, and for challenging the existing knowledge and assumptions of the dominant stakeholders in sectors which do not necessarily dialogue with each other (such as the tourism and access sectors) for creative social solutions.\nThirdly, a bridge between inquiry, industry and community is needed. Many of the future research directions and practical recommendations we propose as scholars are not filtered through our scholarship. We have to ask, where is our scholarship going, what is being done with it, and is it having an impact? If sustainability is about the future, then this work is of critical importance. Within our own field, this might include inclusive tourism research that looks at language, ethics, researcher positionality and care ethics. Related to this, there is a need for a more accessible pedagogy, where inclusive tourism programmes include students with disabilities but also reflect that diversity in their teaching and curriculum. We also need to advocate collaborative approaches to our research that are embedded in industry priorities and processes for social change. These things are important if we are to consider seriously how we might move from a disabling and exclusionary mindset to that of an enabling one that generates inclusion, and by extension, more sustainable outcomes. Our application of the framework of inclusive tourism to examine accessibility reveals we still have some way to go. As such, there is a need to move beyond the conceptual approach we use here to effect change."}, {"title": "The 10 best accessible hotels in Hong Kong, Hong Kong", "article": "Lisa Australia\nI initially stayed for one night at the hotel as I was in transit to my next destination.

Months before this trip, he had reserved a room with a roll-in shower. Yee had even called the property days before his arrival to reconfirm this basic necessity.\nIn the end, none of those efforts made a difference \u2014 the hotel assigned him a room where he couldn't bathe.\nWith no roll-in shower rooms available at the hotel, Yee's plans for the night took an unpleasant turn. He had no choice but to go to bed without washing up after his full day of travel.\nMARRIOTT CINCINNATI AIRPORT/FACEBOOK\nHowever, for Yee, the lack of a usable shower in his room wasn't the worst part of the experience; no, it was the insensitivity to his plight.\nSince he wasn't given the room Marriott had confirmed, he complained and applied for the Ultimate Reservation Guarantee compensation. For his troubles, as a Platinum member, he expected to be eligible for the $200 and 90,000 points outlined in the Ultimate Reservation Guarantee terms.\nA customer service representative, however, inexplicably told Yee that Marriott considers a roll-in shower as an on-request amenity, not a guaranteed feature.

The Americans with Disabilities Act mandates lodging facilities constructed after 1993 must comply with the regulation.\nOlder hotels may not have modern-day accessibility elements. The good news is that many hotels have voluntarily complied with the ADA even if the property isn't required to do so. However, it doesn't mean that hotels, even newly built ones, have tons of ADA-compliant accommodations or those with accessibility features they rely on, so travelers with specific needs face hurdles with every single stay.\nThe issue goes beyond Marriott\nDr. Jayne Fortson was a 19-year-old student at Albany State University when an ill-advised adventure with friends altered her life forever. While exploring Thatcher State Park in Upstate New York, the group entered a cave that collapsed on them. A gravely injured Fortson was trapped under a pile of rubble inside the cave for nearly 24 hours.\nRescuers were finally able to extract her, but the damage to her body was permanent. Since that time, nearly 50 years ago, Fortson has been paralyzed from the waist down.\nStill, she never let this tragic accident interfere with her life plans. Just weeks later, she returned to Albany State University to continue her studies. Fortson developed a new goal: to ensure that students with mobility challenges could freely navigate campus.\nFortson graduated on time, went on to medical school and, in her free time, became an accomplished Paralympian. She married, raised a family and is a world traveler.\nThere's almost nothing Fortson hasn't been able to do despite the twist her fate took that night all those years ago.\nSo, imagine her surprise when she recently hit a hurdle she couldn't navigate at an unassuming Hyatt House in Morristown, New Jersey.\nNo way to shower at this Hyatt hotel\nHyatt House in Morristown, New Jersey. HYATT\nAfter traveling all day from Alaska to the East Coast to attend a family wedding, Fortson arrived at the front desk of the Hyatt House. Although she had alerted the staff that she uses a wheelchair and requires a fully accessible room with a roll-in shower, she was given a standard room.\nWhen she brought this issue up to the staff, they informed her that the property only has two accessible rooms with roll-in showers, and both were already occupied.\nThings went from bad to worse when she entered her assigned room. Not only did it not have a roll-in shower, but it had a raised bed, which made it much more difficult for her to transfer herself from the bed to her wheelchair and vice versa.\nFor the next two days, Fortson and her two daughters tried to make do.\n\"It was terrible, and of course, we couldn't leave since we were there for a wedding. We were with a large family group,\" Fortson told TPG. \"The only way I could get into bed was with the help of my daughters and the strength of my arms.\"\n\"But a raised bed like that would be impossible for a wheelchair-dependent guest to use without assistance,\" she continued. \"And since the bathroom had no roll-in shower, I could not bathe during my stay. It was demoralizing.\"\nDespite complaining to the front desk and reminding management that she had confirmed a specific type of room to accommodate her needs, the hotel had no other rooms to offer her and told her nothing could be done.\n\"In all my years of traveling, I have never experienced such a terrible situation at a hotel,\" Fortson told me during a phone call from her home in Alaska. \"I always try to stay at a Marriott because that brand is consistently attuned to the needs of their guests. If something goes wrong, they make it right.\"\nFortson went on to relate her experiences at various Marriott hotels in which the staff went above and beyond to ensure she could easily access all areas of her room. She told me that, in her opinion, Marriott is the gold standard for mobility-challenged guests.\nThis made Yee's Marriott complaint, which was sitting there on my desk as I chatted with Fortson, rather ironic.\nMarriott customer service: A roll-in shower is a request not guaranteed\nWhen I went through the paper trail Yee included in his emails, I shared his view that the Marriott customer service representative he had been dealing with needed some sensitivity training.\nHere was the initial email response Yee received from Marriott customer service after his stay:\n\"I reviewed the Confirmation email that you sent in. It states the Guaranteed Request: Mobility Accessible Room with Roll-In Shower.\nPer Marriott terms and conditions, under Section 4.3.c.vii. Guaranteed Room Type may have applied in this situation.\nAs a Platinum Elite member, you are entitled to this benefit compensation. However, the only room type that was guaranteed was the King bed. The Roll In shower was a request, not a guarantee.\nIn order to guarantee this room type as required, it is best to contact our Customer Care agents when booking so that we may coordinate with the proper team to ensure the room type is available at the hotel for your stay and to make sure that it is specifically set aside for you.\nYou have been given 10,000 bonus points for the situation. You can see these points on the Activity section of your account.\nEmmett, thank you for choosing Marriott for your travel needs. We look forward to assisting you with new adventures and travel memories in the future.\nHappy and safe travels.\n*******\nMarriott Bonvoy\u2122 Case Resolutions Specialist\"\nThis \"Case Resolutions Specialist\" seemed to be ignoring what Yee had already explained to them: He had called the hotel several times before arrival to remind the property of his needs.\nAlso, their closing signature, which most certainly came from a template, was more than a little tone-deaf.\nYee certainly did not need the assistance of Marriott in the future to create the type of travel memories it had created during this \"adventure.\"\nAsking Marriott if an accessible shower is really on-request only\nNot willing to give up, Yee continued to correspond with this Marriott \"specialist,\" who remained unswayed. So, Yee turned to TPG for help.\nAfter speaking with Yee and reviewing his documents, I was confident that Marriott would want to make some sort of amends for this situation \u2013 including addressing the specialist's repeated declaration that a roll-in shower is a request-only feature, like extra pillows, a bucket of ice or a specific view.\nI reached out to our executive contact at Marriott. This is not a customer service-facing person. This is someone I can contact as a consumer advocate and member of the media.\nAs I wrote:\n\"Emmett is very disappointed with what happened at the hotel, but he is even more disappointed by Marriott's response. [******] response makes it appear as if he complained about something trivial -- not that he had no way to have the basic necessity of showering.\n[*******] also told him that the Marriott Ultimate Reservation Guarantee doesn't apply to requests for accessible rooms.\nThis response seems insensitive to the feelings and needs of a person suffering with a brain tumor and who is trying to continue to live his life and travel for as long as possible.\nCould your team please have a look at this case and see if he actually does qualify for the Platinum Reservation Guarantee compensation?\nThanks! Michelle Couch-Friedman, Consumer Advocate\"\nIt wasn't long before I received a response.\nThe good (and common-sense) news from Marriott\nMARRIOTT CINCINNATI AIRPORT/FACEBOOK\nVery quickly, Yee received the good news from Marriott. Of course, an accessible shower is not an on-request amenity. It's a requirement for a traveler in a wheelchair.\nThe Marriott executive office contacted Yee to offer an apology and compensation that went beyond the Marriott Reservation Guarantee terms.\nAs in another Marriott case I recently wrote about, the individual property provided the generous resolution. (Note: Many Marriott properties are independently owned, franchised hotels. As a result, sometimes Marriott corporate's intervention can only accomplish so much.)\nYee wrote to tell me the good news:\n\"Hi Michelle, I just got off the phone. **** (name redacted for privacy) said the [Marriott property] offered 80,000 points, refunded our stay charge, plus $500 to cover what should have been a roll-in shower room somewhere that night.\nI told her that's more than what the Ultimate Reservation Guarantee states. She knew, and said the hotel wanted to make up for all the troubles. Also, she put me on a list related to internal ADA training programs they are working on.\nI don't think any of what's occurred in the past few days could have happened without your intervention. THANK YOU VERY MUCH! Emmett Yee\"\nWith Yee's problem successfully addressed, I turned my sights to the Hyatt House to find out what had happened with Fortson's reservation.\nWhat about that Hyatt House?\nHyatt House Boston/Burlington's ADA bathroom. AIMBRIDGE HOSPITALITY/HYATT\nI wish I could say that things went similarly well for Dr. Fortson, but they didn't.\nI sent multiple requests to the executive team at Hyatt over the course of several weeks but did not receive a response concerning Fortson's experience. For its part, this Hyatt House, which is an independently owned and franchised property, did issue Fortson Hyatt points as a goodwill gesture after her stay.\nIn response to an email from Fortson's sister, who was hosting the wedding, the property's manager wrote at the time:\n\"Thank you for bringing this important issue to our attention. I apologize that your sister's experience with our front desk team, and in her suite, was not a positive one and that we were unable to provide the room type that she had initially booked. While we did our best to make up for this on the day by providing her a shower chair so that she could use the shower in her suite, I understand that it was not an ideal solution. As a token of apology, I would like to provide her with 24,000 World of Hyatt points to her account. Enough for [two] free nights at a similar category hotel.\n(Hyatt House Morristown, spokesperson)\"\nFortson wasn't after compensation, though. As was the case when she first became a paraplegic as a college sophomore and immediately set out to be an advocate for others in the same situation, Fortson's goal in contacting TPG was to share her experience so that others might learn from it and be able to avoid the same. After this trip, she'll be sticking with Marriott, she says.\nWhile investigating this story, I learned that Avion Hospitality took over the management of this Hyatt House franchise in March 2023, well after Fortson's incident occurred. I was able to reach a spokesperson for the company, who told me that they intend to use this situation as a training opportunity for the staff on how to handle these situations better in the future \"with a refocus on ADA procedures.\"\n(Editor's note: Several days after publication, a public relations representative from Hyatt reached out with the following comment from Hyatt House Morristown general manager, Michael Barrett, who said, \"We sincerely apologize for this guest's experience. When we have not fully lived up to our purpose to care for people so they can be their best \u2013 like in this case \u2013 we hold ourselves accountable to do better. We addressed this situation with our team in an effort to prevent similar situations in the future.\")\nHowever, those two ADA-compliant rooms with roll-in showers remain permanently occupied, so it's unclear what plan of action the hotel will be able to take.\nHow to avoid ending up in an inaccessible room\nUnfortunately, I know from my case files that the experiences of these two TPG readers aren't unique. Due to poorly trained staff, sloppiness in the hotels' reservation systems, or franchise property owners who are unaware of the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act, travelers with mobility challenges can easily end up in inaccessible rooms.\nHere are some tips to reduce the chances of getting assigned a hotel room that can't meet your basic needs.\nConfirm that the hotel has accessible rooms\nThe first step to finding out if a property can fit your needs is to determine if the structure was built after 1993. If it wasn't, contact the hotel and ask if they've refurbished to comply with the ADA. Even if your hotel was built after the ADA was passed, you should probably still get in touch directly to learn about the accommodation options and property features.\nBased on ADA regulations, there may be only one or two rooms at the property that meet your needs. Travelers who need mobility assistance should be especially cautious of smaller properties (fewer than 50 rooms) as these aren't required to have any accessible rooms with roll-in showers.\nEven if you do ascertain that a hotel has rooms with the features you need, you'll need to dig deeper to determine if you can stay there comfortably.\nFind out precisely what an accessible room means at the hotel\nThere isn't a national definition of what an accessible room means in the United States, leaving it up to the traveler to confirm if the hotel will meet their needs.\nSome hotels will satisfy the requirement for a specific number of accessible rooms by creating accommodations that may or may not make things accessible to your situation. For instance, if you need a roll-in shower, booking an accessible room is not enough to be sure you'll get what you require.\nIt's critical that you find out from the hotel what types of rooms they have and what specific amenities each offers. Don't forget to ask about the public areas of the property. You can't assume that an accessible room means the same thing across the travel industry. It doesn't.\nAsk the hotel about your room \u2014 and get it in writing\nIn Yee's case, he had the roll-in shower confirmed in writing from Marriott. However, in Fortson's case, the hotel staff told her things they never noted in her reservation. In both cases, the rooms they were assigned lacked what they needed.\nBefore you book any hotel, make certain that the room you're booking can accommodate you. When you discuss your needs with the hotel, note the name of the person you're speaking with and let them know you're taking notes.\nUnfortunately, phone representatives sometimes say things that might not be accurate, and after you disconnect from that person, you have no record of what was said. So, take your notes and ask for a summary of your conversation to be sent to you via email. Most reputable companies will comply with this request.\nReconfirm via email and phone several days before your stay\nCall the hotel and remind the staff you'll soon be arriving and what your specific requirements are. Most hotels start blocking off and assigning rooms several days before a traveler's arrival date. It's crucial that before their scheduling team gets to work, you give them that reminder.\nFrequently reminding the property of your impending arrival and needs isn't you being a nuisance \u2013 it's you making sure that you receive what you require.\nBottom line\nI'm happy we could help Yee in this situation. I am surprised that Hyatt refused to comment on Fortson's experience, though the property did attempt to make a goodwill gesture in the form of points. Readers with specific mobility needs may wish to consider those responses in their future travel plans.\nRemember, if you find yourself in a battle with an airline, cruise line, car rental agency, vacation rental company or credit card, send your request for help to tips@thepointsguy.com, and I will be super happy to help you, too."}, {"title": null, "article": null}, {"title": null, "article": null}, {"title": "Flying with mobility aids", "article": "We have accessible toilets on all of our aircraft.

For instance, the total number of wheelchair requests in 2017 was approximately 15 million, a 30% increase on 2016.\nWhy is providing better access to individuals with disabilities important for the air transport industry?\nSafe and dignified travel for all passengers, including those with disabilities, is an airline commitment in addition, for the air transport industry it's not just because it is \"the right thing to do\" it also makes business sense.\nIATA member airlines have an inherent motivation to ensure that all people with accessibility needs have a positive experience when traveling by air. These people are customers-and are a growing segment of the population. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that more than one billion people live with some form of disability, which constitutes approximately 15% of the world's population.\nAirlines commit to improve travel for passengers with disabilities\nTherefore in 2019, the IATA Annual General Meeting (AGM) unanimously adopted a landmark industry resolution which re-affirmed the commitment of IATA member airlines to provide safe, reliable and dignified travel for people with disabilities. At the center of IATA's developement of its guiding principles and all its work on accessibility since, is the disability community's own guiding principle of \"Nothing For Us, Without Us.\" At every stage of the development of airline accessibility policy and operating standards, the disability community is involved and listened to. This is of course the only way to keep the focus on disability, accessibility and inclusion-particularly when facing a new reality and new measures due to a pandemic.\nChanging the focus from disability to accessibility and inclusion is allowing the travel sector to bring together passengers with disabilities and governments. Harmonizing regulations and processes and providing the clarity and global consistency that passengers expect.\nInterview with Linda Ristagno, IATA's AD External Affairs on Air Transport Accessibility\nAirlines launch global action group to improve handling of disability mobility aids\nIn July 2021, IATA announced the launch of a global Mobility Aids Action Group to examine and improve the transport journey of mobility aids, including wheelchairs, with the objective of improving the handling of this vital equipment for travelers with disabilities.\nThe Action Group is the first of its kind aimed at tackling issues around the safe and secure transport of mobility aids\u2014an issue of huge importance to a growing number of travelers. It also provides advice and recommendations to airlines and other stakeholders concerning the establishment of policy, process and standards related to the handling and transport of mobility aids.\nUniquely, the Mobility Aids Action Group involves the full range of stakeholders impacted by this issue, including accessibility organizations (representing travelers with disabilities), airlines, ground service providers, airports and mobility aids manufacturers. It is the first time a mobility aids manufacturer will be invited to participate in an IATA task force. \u201cAs airlines are just one link in the chain in the handling of mobility aids, it is essential we bring all players together to develop solutions. What\u2019s more, we are excited to invite a mobility aids manufacturer to the table. We think this is critical so all stakeholders can work together to take steps to improve the transport journey of mobility aids,\u201d said Willie Walsh, Director General of IATA.\nWheelchair damage or loss during air transportation\nWhile the industry has had standards for persons traveling with disabilities for some time there are still gaps. Damage to mobility aids has been an area that has been identified as a key topic to address from the disability community.\nAirlines have made efforts to improve, but damage or loss is still occurring. And when it does, it is highly distressing to the passenger as these devices are more than equipment\u2014they are extensions of their body and essential to their independence.\nTravelers with mobility aids face risks to their health and safety if their wheelchair or mobility equipment is lost, damaged or destroyed, as replacements are not always provided, and if provided, are not always suitable for the person\u2019s needs.\nThe loss or damage of wheelchairs or other mobility equipment takes away the independence of the traveler and affects every aspect of their daily lives until the matter is resolved appropriately.\nA recent survey from Able Move identified that among those who actively continue to fly, 55% say the biggest single cause of concern when flying was the fear of their wheelchair being damaged or lost.\n\u201cEvery year, thousands of wheelchairs are transported safely by air. However, damage or loss is still occurring. And when it does, it is devastating to the passenger as these devices are more than equipment\u2014they are extensions of their body and essential to their independence. We acknowledge that we are not where we want to be on this as an industry. This is why we want to do something about it on a global level, not through setting up a talking shop, but by bringing the key groups together to take practical action,\u201d said Willie Walsh, Director General of IATA.\nImproved access for passengers with disabilities in the industry restart\nAs airlines rebuild, the industry is eager to build a more inclusive restart. Despite the COVID-19 crisis, the IATA and its member airlines have worked with the accessibility community to move the priority of accessible air travel forward through a number of efforts. These are includeded in the latest Airport Handling Manual (AHM).\nWhat to consider for passengers' with disabilities air travel journey\nTo the extent possible, airline and other stakeholders should strive to ensure that passengers with disabilities maintain their independence and dignity. This is accomplished through adequate airport infrastructure, appropriate training, timely and customer-oriented services, as well as making use of technological solutions that can be leveraged to provided passengers with disabilities with choice and freedom to travel on their own terms. You can find detailed guidelines which can help your operations in section 176 of the AHM.\nPre-Travel: Passenger information, booking and ticketing\nCommunicating assistance needs in advance of travel is recommended and, in some cases, required to fulfill specialized requests. This allows airlines, airports and third-party service providers to be better prepared to assist passengers with disabilities throughout their travel itinerary, making the journey easier and the travel experience more seamless and enjoyable.\nAt the airport\nThe sole responsibility to provide assistance to passengers with disabilities throughout the airport is not limited to the airlines; depending on national regulations, airports may be responsible for providing assistance to passengers with disabilities directly, or via third-party service providers.\nAs not all passenger processes at an airport fall under the airlines\u2019 responsibility (i.e. security screening, exit immigration, customs, etc.) airlines need to work collaboratively with airports, regulators and other stakeholders in order to provide a safe and satisfying travel experience to all passengers.\nCheck-in\nAll available check-in methods such as via airline websites, mobile apps, self-service kiosks should be accessible to passengers with disabilities. In addition, airline agents involved in the check-in process should be trained to ensure that adequate assistance is provided. Passengers with disabilities should also always be offered assistance with carry-on and checked baggage.\nMobility device handling\nThe safe transport of a passenger\u2019s with disability personal mobility device is a critical operation for any airline as the wheelchair or scooter is an extension of the passenger and should be treated as such. Other mobility aids such as walkers and canes provide passengers struggling with mobility much-needed stability and support to safely walk and should also be handled with great care. As general guidance, the transportation of passenger battery-powered devices must be compliant with DGR subsection 2.3.\nBoarding and disembarking\nBoarding the aircraft can be a stressful experience for passengers with disabilities. Airlines should ensure that any requests made in advance are properly noted and any last-minute requests are handled efficiently and with care. Assistance must be provided as necessary, in addition airlines and airports should coordinate to make available at all stations wheelchairs and other mobility devices for boarding/disembarking within airport facilities, before departure, during intermediate stops and on arrival. Upon arrival, airlines should make best efforts to accommodate the passengers with disabilities, procedures will vary by terminal and gate configuration in terms of boarding bridge, etc. Therefore, all staff should be properly trained to provide: adequate mobility transfer techniques and prompt delivery of mobility devices. More details can be found in the Airport Handling Manual (AHM).\nWhat are the benefits of following the IATA guidance found in the AHM?\nPutting into practice the IATA guidance, airlines, airports and other industry stakeholders will:\nEfficiently serve passengers with disabilities by using IATA standards and best practices\nEfficiently communicate with passengers with disabilities before and during their travel experience\nEnsure available measures are applied consistently\nIdentify good practices in passenger assistance during disruptions and irregular operations\nHow can I get the Airport Handling Manual (AHM)?\nYou can order the latest edition of the AHM here."}, {"title": null, "article": null}, {"title": "New Guidance to Improve Transportation of Mobility Aids", "article": "Geneva - The International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced new guidance to assist airlines and handling agents to transport mobility aids safely and efficiently and improve the travel experience for passengers with disabilities.\nProviding safe, reliable and dignified transport for passengers with disabilities is a priority for airlines that was reinforced by a unanimously approved Resolution at the 75th IATA Annual General Meeting in 2019. The safe and efficient transport of mobility aids was identified as a key area for improvement by airlines, working with industry stakeholders and disability groups.\n\u201cAirlines are committed to ensuring passengers with disabilities can travel with dignity, confidence and comfort. Working with representatives from the disability community, we established that new protocols to improve the transport of mobility aids were urgently required. This new guidance, created in partnership with key players in the travel chain, will improve service, and significantly reduce damage to these vital devices that are often an extension to the body of a passenger with a disability,\u201d said Nick Careen, IATA\u2019s Senior Vice President for Operations, Safety and Security.\nKey elements of the new guidance include:\nBetter processes for booking and information exchange, including the use of Special Service Request (SSR) and Passenger Name Requirement (PNR) codes to give advance information on the specifications of mobility aids\nA recommendation to create an electronic mobility aid tag, fixed to the mobility aid and containing technical information which will help airlines and ground handlers transport the aid safely\nAdvice to airlines on developing a communications toolkit for engaging with passengers with disabilities, including a clearly signposted and accessible website area.\nBest practices for loading, collection and return of mobility aids\nA recommendation for dedicated specialized ramp personnel to be trained and deployed to handle mobility aids\nGuidance for how to properly resolve instances where mobility aids are damaged\nRevised and enhanced training of ground handlers and airline staff\n\u201cExperience shows that communication is key to improving the handling of mobility aids. This guidance sets out steps for passengers, airlines, and the travel chain to exchange information at every stage of the travel journey. It will help airlines perform better and give passengers using mobility aids greater confidence. We\u2019ll be working with our members and stakeholders to operationalize this guidance, and the industry will be reaching out to policymakers to encourage harmonization with national regulations,\u201d said Careen.\nThe guidance reflects and builds on industry best practices and will continue to be revised and expanded prior to developing into industry standards. Other aspects include recommendations for airport designs to meet accessibility standards, as well as specific guidance to ensure compliance with the Dangerous Goods Regulations (for lithium-battery powered devices), in addition to step-by-step instructions on safely and securely loading mobility aids on board.\n> Access IATA Guidance on the Transport of Mobility Aids (pdf)\nFor more information, please contact:\nCorporate Communications\nTel: +41 22 770 2967\nEmail: corpcomms@iata.org\nNotes for Editors:"}, {"title": "16 tips to make travelling with a disability easier", "article": "Travelling as a disabled person is never straightforward.

Check your travel insurance\nFrustratingly, travel insurance costs more simply because you have a disability \u2014 but it\u2019s very important to get the right cover; listing long-term medical conditions and chronic illnesses will save you a fortune if you need medical attention on holiday. Remember that additional insurance to protect mobility aids may also be needed. Shop around for your insurance, a comparison website can show you the best deal depending on how much assistance you need.\n2. Pack enough medication\nAnd check that you can take it into the country you\u2019re visiting. Remembering your medication could be the difference between a good break away and a bad one. Cut down your chances of losing medication when you travel by packing it in separate bags \u2014 one lot in your suitcase, one lot in your hand luggage \u2014 it will mean you\u2019ve always got some to hand no matter what.\nSome countries limit how much of certain types of medication you can carry on one person at one time; strong painkillers are often restricted so get a dispensation letter from your doctor if you need one.\n3. Check with your GP for any extra immunisations\nWe all need jabs when we go to certain destinations but, with particular health conditions, you may need more. It\u2019s definitely worth booking an appointment with your GP or registered nurse to make sure you\u2019re covered.\nHollie-Anne Brooks in Paris\n4. Check you\u2019re fit to fly\nYour GP should also help check that you\u2019re fit to fly. Don\u2019t forget any extras you may need to take with you such as compression socks, spare feeding tubes or masks.\n5. Get a free (or discounted) space for your carer or PA\nTravelling often means having to take a personal assistant with you and if you need multiple carers this can soon add up. Thankfully, you can get discounts \u2014 and often get free spaces. Eurostar, for example, only has wheelchair spaces in standard premier or business class but you will get these at the price of standard tickets; this includes one seat at standard price for your carer too.\n6. Remember all your mobility aids\nMany of us use different mobility aids for different days. If you\u2019re an ambulatory wheelchair user, are you also going to need to take a walking stick with you? Do you need different mobility aids to cover all terrains you might experience on your trip?\nAn airport lift for passengers who use wheelchairs (Getty Images)\n7. Familiarise yourself with the procedure for checking-in mobility aids\nDon\u2019t panic about being without your wheels when flying. Your wheelchair will be stored with the luggage and you\u2019ll be given another to transport you around airports at either end and to and from your seat. If your personal wheelchair or mobility aid comes with specialist storage instructions or needs to be handled in a certain way, make sure the airline knows and you know where, when and how your mobility aid will be returned to you.\n8. Use websites like AccessAble to plan your trip\nAccessAble provides full reviews and information about everything from where the accessible public toilets are in a city to which hotels offer accessible spa access. Plan ahead, including where you are going to eat, and make sure any companies you book through are aware of your access needs and have ramps, working lifts, braille menus and anything else you may require.\nEuan\u2019s Guide provides similar reviews and allows disabled people to leave reviews of different aspects of their visit to certain attractions, so you can get a first-hand account of what you\u2019re about to experience.\n9. Use a specialist travel agents\nSome travel agents, such as Travel Counsellors, specialise in creating incredible accessible travel experiences. If you\u2019re unsure where to even begin, use a specialist agency who can cover everything for you from booking your transfers to and from the hotel to whether the swimming pool has a hoist to which spas have wheelchair accessible treatment rooms.\n10. Consider renting a mobility device\nMany hotels, museums, cruise ships and holiday resorts have mobility scooters and wheelchairs that you can often rent free of charge or for a small fee. Airport assistance will be able to transport you around the airport in a wheelchair or on a buggy and, once you arrive at your destination, check out the range of mobility aids on offer to help get you round the resort.\nMake sure your hotel room has space for your service animal to work, rest and play (Alamy)\n11. Make sure your accommodation has enough room for your service animal\nIf you\u2019re travelling with a service animal, such as a guide dog, make sure the hotel room you\u2019re provided with has enough room for your animal to work, rest and play. Look for hotels with large grounds so you can walk your animal and know your rights \u2014 it is illegal for anyone in the UK to turn away someone with a guide dog, whether that be when entering a taxi or going to a restaurant.\n12. Take an extension lead\nA multi-plug extension lead will become your best friend on holiday; if you\u2019ve got an electric wheelchair to charge and other pieces of equipment that require electricity then the one plug socket that\u2019s not by the bed isn\u2019t going to help. Take an extension lead so you can plug your equipment into multiple holes and have the power connected right next to where you need it.\nSee our pick of the best hotels with accessible rooms\nWhile you\u2019re there\n13. Pace yourself\nIt can be tempting to take part in a tonne of activities, visit all the museums and galleries and spend the night working your way through the cocktail menu but it\u2019s important to remember to pace yourself to keep your health in its best shape for as long as possible.\n14. Embrace train and airport lounges\nOn Eurostar, for example, all disabled people can use the business lounge whether you\u2019re travelling business class or not. I like to use this time to familiarise myself with my itinerary, as well as enjoy the perks such as free snacks, wine and beer.\n15. Use your blue badge\nWe may not be in the EU anymore but your blue badge for parking that you use in the UK is still valid across the EU. Outside of the EU, different rules apply so make sure to check the country\u2019s driving and parking rules ahead of time to avoid a potential fine.\n16. Check foreign public transport\nNot all transport abroad will be as equipped for disabled people as what we\u2019re used to in the UK. Check to see if you need to book assistance or make any other amendments.\nWhere can I travel without a vaccine?"}]
